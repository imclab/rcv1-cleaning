Member since: July 08, 2007 Total points: 29,101 (Level 7) Add Contact Block Best Answer - Chosen by Voters I think you are talking about salvage yard parts. If this is the case the Hollander Interchange Manual is what many of the yards use. It is like their secret bible and is available on the net but costs an incredible amount of money to have and to update. Some salvage yards will tell you what cars indiividual parts fit but unless there is money in there pocket. Don&#039;t bet on it. Now if it&#039;s a basic part that is available in an autoparts store such as my old place of many years. We had a parts identifier in the back of most of our catalogs which showed the popularity of individual parts and what cars they fit &quot; application section&quot; (that&#039;s it )... anyway. A good parts store with catalogs will be able to help you if you know of any. Many places (especially chain stores ) use the computer programs and don&#039;t have knowledge of this to their counterman/women. If you would like some additional info just e-mail me and I&#039;ll try to help you out.. I still miss the autoparts world but the pay was a bit relentless. Good Luck to you. 5 years ago Report Abuse 100% 1 Vote 1 person rated this as good  1 stars - mark this as Interesting! Email Comment ( 0 ) Save Add to My Yahoo!
