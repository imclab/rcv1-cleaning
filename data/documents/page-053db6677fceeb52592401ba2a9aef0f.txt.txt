The 20-year-old singer-and-actress is slightly perturbed by enthusiastic followers who brand themselves with tattoos of her face or name and show them off to her. Asked about the weirdest thing a fan has done, she said: ''I've had somebody tattoo me on their leg actually. That was pretty intense.'' Although she found the body ink disturbing, she added to French radio show, C'Cauet: ''It was cool though.'' Many of the 'Come and Get It' hitmaker's devoted fans have tattoos in her honour and they frequently decide to bare their decorated flesh to her in unusual places. A young female admirer proudly showed Selena a tattoo she had gotten of her name located on her lower back while the singer made her way through Los Angeles International Airport in May 2012. Selena took a moment to thank the enthusiastic young girl, who also has a tattoo bearing the name 'Demi' - in honour of fellow former Disney star, Demi Lovato. The 'Spring Breakers' star also has two tattoos of her own, including a musical note on the side of her right hand and the Roman numerals 'LXXVI' on the back of her neck. The star had the numerical marking added last September by celebrity tattooist Bang Bang in New York City. He said at the time: ''Selena was nervous it might have been painful, so she held her best friend's hand the whole time. But she did a great job.''
