 Alternate History Literature  &nbsp; (14&nbsp;Sites,&nbsp;113 recent hits) 
 Alternate history or alternative history is a subgenre of speculative fiction (or some would say of science fiction) that is set in a world in which history has diverged from history as it is generally known. Alternate history literature asks the question, "What if history had developed differently?" Most works in this genre are based in real historical events, yet feature social, geopolitical, or industrial circumstances that developed differently than our own. While to some extent all fiction can be described as "alternate history," the subgenre proper comprises fiction in which a change or point of divergence occurs in the past that causes human society to develop in a way that is distinct from our own. The ALTERNATE HISTORY LITERATUREis currently featuring G.E. Graven's online gothic epic, GROTESQUE, for review! Welcome aboard! AspiAuthors  &nbsp; (4&nbsp;Sites,&nbsp;47 recent hits)
