Best Movie Theater: Winner! Philip Riggan Richmond.com When we opened the voting for Best Movie Theater among Richmond area silver screens, we expected there to be plenty of theater-specific fans behind the voting and that the theaters central to the city would get the bulk of the votes. Wrong. Movieland at Boulevard Square  and  CinéBistro at Stony Point made their runs in the voting, but the big fan following after a gentle social media push made the voting a runaway win for the Goochland Drive-In Theater . How many followers? Try 21,400+ on Facebook for the "GDIT," which is located in Hadensville in Goochland County and celebrated it's third anniversary this past weekend. "The whole social media thing has been a big driver for us to get people out here," said owner John Heidel, who opened the drive-in with his wife, Kristina, in August 2009. "The price point has been a big reason," John said. Cost is $7 for adults and $3 for children under 12 for nightly double features in the summer, rain or shine. The drive-in has a playground, concession stand and customers are allowed to bring lounge chairs and blankets to get comfortable. They will switch to a Friday-Saturday schedule after Labor Day, with occasional special features and hope to keep running until sometime in November, depending on the weather. Moviegoers can see first-run movies played on an 80-by-40-foot screen with sound provided to each car through a low-power FM radio transmitter. The drive-in has about 340 spaces and can fit up to 380 for special occasions, he said. "We hate to turn people away, especially folks that drive more than 15 minutes away. Sellouts are rare," Heidel said. "We've been pretty constant -- except for the heat wave in late June." Being located in Goochland allows GDIT to draw from Richmond and Charlottesville and being away from metro areas means there is little ambient light and noise to interfere with the drive-in experience. He said most drive-ins were laid out with 1940s design and the Heidels did their research to prepare and design the 10-acre site. "It was quite a task to get it up and running," John said. "For us, this was about making a dream come true." There just aren't many drive-in theaters around anymore and the charm is a part of the draw, Heidel said. "I wish more drive-ins were open. They seem to be a relic of the past." The eventual transition from 35mm movies to digital is going to be a tough obstacle to survive, he said. It's going to hurt a lot of older and smaller drive-ins due to the massive cost. "We'll have to get all new projection equipment...film operations will become horse and buggy."  Questions on the Besties? Check out About the Richmond.com Besties for answers to FAQ.
