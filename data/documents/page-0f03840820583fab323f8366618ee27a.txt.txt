Technologies like mobility and natural user interface, together with audio-video experiences are impacting all consumer centric industries including the automotive segment. Unfortunately, most of the experiences these technologies enable are meant for passengers, not drivers. The automotive industry is focusing on distraction-free convergence to provide better and safer experiences through predictive driving support, communications exchange systems, and disaster information networks. The best is yet to come, and we are just scratching the surface of what a safe, yet converged world could be. Why should you consider HCL? Our heritage. We understand what it takes to develop a culture of continuous innovation. For 35 years we have built enduring partnerships with leading enterprise solutions vendors and industry associations. We provide best-of-breed experience in areas like application management, supply chain planning, aftermarket services, embedded software, electronics engineering, integrated product engineering, mechanical engineering, product testing, and manufacturing. Next-generation technologies . At HCL, we realize that automotive OEMs and Tier 1s must be in sync with the latest disruptive technologies. We were the first company to work with Ford on its Open XC platform, and we have supported a connected car apps framework, developed a mobile data terminal for a fleet management company, designed imaging algorithms for various road geographies, been involved in the development of a next-gen camera, developed and simulated a hybrid powertrain and AUTOSAR components. Sophisticated solutions. We work with seven of the top ten global automotive companies on solutions that blend smart electronics with mechanical enhancements to improve the passenger experience. These products, supported by our applications, are now being installed in almost every major car and commercial vehicle brand. An integrated approach. Our customers (Tier 1 and Tier 2 automakers, OEMs, and dealers) are achieving collaboration, visibility across their supply chains, and faster time to market through our integrated services approach across automotive IT, engineering, electronics and embedded services, and plant automation. State-of-the-art facilities. Through our Automotive Lab for software development, simulation, and testing, we have earned a reputation for delivering defect-free solutions.
