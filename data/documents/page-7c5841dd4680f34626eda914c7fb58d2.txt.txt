People like you should be assamed of making fun of people who are not well. Congratulations, you won the bitchest person award. You should be proud you completely deserve it Post on April 19, 2013 at 8:52 pm Lucy Said: @Caterina Uh you know that Gossip Girl is just reposting fan art that AMANDA BYNES retweeted, right?
