Posted by Sarah Beth Hensley , March 05, 2011 at 03:53 PM 1 Comment Recommend  Flag as Inappropriate Loading... x &times; Next Previous Slideshow Download What do you wager? At , they are wagering their souls and dolls in their performance of and the stakes are high. “Guys and Dolls” hit the Broadway stage in 1950, with 1,200 performances and five Tonys, including one for best musical. Set in the midst of endless dealing and gambling in the incessant clamor of New York City, the story is built around Nathan Detroit (Robert Schepis) and his wandering crap game. Nathan bets the suave Sky Masterson (Ben Mitchell) he can’t take the conservative, holy roller Sergeant Sarah Brown (Astrea Somarriba) of the Save a Soul Mission to Havana. But Detroit also has to face the 14-year-long engagement to his Hot Box Dancer fiancée, Adelaide (Marta Knudson). This one is a tough bet. St. Andrew’s Episcopal School’s performance brought humor and excitement to the stage, adapting to sound mishaps and other minor issues along the way nicely. The male vocalists were the backbone of the show with confident and cool characters and great voices to boot. Ben Mitchell owned the stage with his sleek and assured portrayal of Sky Masterson, successfully impressing more than one doll as the audience sighed after hearing his strong vocals and seeing his charisma on stage. Mitchell carried a strong and natural stage presence as he imposed his bad boy charm in &#34;I&#39;ll Know.&#34; Schepis and Knudson worked together to create a humorous “old married couple” feel, with New York accents that lit up the stage.  The crapshooters gave the show intensity and authenticity, with the essence of 1920s bad boys. Detroit’s posse, Nicely Johnson (Drew Looney), Benny Southstreet (Ben Coleman) and Rusty Charlie (Chris Naughton) added to the performance as the threesome was reminiscent to the Three Stooges. In the “Fugue of the Tinhorns” number, the three started off the show with great energy and entertaining antics, slapping each other with their caps, and debating where to place their bets.  In some numbers, the range and choreography seemed challenging, but the cast gave it a good effort, and the performers never strayed from character. St. Andrews Tech Crew was able to transform the stage easily with their large scrim and many interesting light up props such as street signs stop lights gave the set a creative extra touch. The projected scenes combined with the impressive jazz band made longer scene changes tolerable. Even when faced with faulty microphones throughout the show, the cast and crew adapted and continued through rough patches commendably. St. Andrew’s Episcopal School gave “Guys and Dolls” a good effort. With good drama and humor it turned out to be a smart bet, met with lots of laughs.   Editor’s Note: by Mary Kate Mehegan of Oakton High School through the high school Cappies program, the critics and awards program for high school theater.
