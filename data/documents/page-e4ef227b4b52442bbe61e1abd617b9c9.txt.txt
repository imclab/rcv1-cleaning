We're pretty sure you'll appreciate our fastidious nature. And the absence of your uncertainty. Visit the Audi Showroom Shop more What is CPO? CPO stands for certified pre-owned. Usually, a certified pre-owned vehicle is a newer, low-mileage model that has been inspected, refurbished and certified by a manufacturer or other certifying authority. Typically, a certified pre-owned vehicle will come with an extended warranty, special financing or other benefits. Since vehicles depreciate the quickest in the first few years, a certified pre-owned vehicle makes a higher-end vehicle more accessible while still providing peace of mind to the buyer. Is certified pre-owned just another word for "used car"? Unlike "pre-owned" or "pre-driven", a certified pre-owned vehicle is not just a used car. These vehicles have passed a multi-point inspection, been repaired, and been given a warranty. While they typically cost more than a comparable used car, they also give the buyer peace of mind. Who does the certification of certified pre-owned vehicles? While some dealerships offer certified pre-owned vehicles, most are certified by manufacturers themselves. The certification process varies by manufacturer, but all entail a comprehensive multi-point inspection to identify and repair problems and a warranty that backs up those repairs. What are the advantages of certified pre-owned vehicles? Certified pre-owned vehicles are less expensive than comparable new vehicles while giving buyers peace of mind they can't get in buying a used vehicle. Generally speaking, a new car will go down in value as much as 20% in the year after it's driven off the lot. As such, a higher-end car that is unaffordable new could now be accessible as a certified pre-owned vehicle. Alternately, a buyer purchasing a used car takes a certain amount of risk not knowing what, if any, problems may lurk under the hood. While typically more expensive, purchasing a certified pre-owned vehicle protects against much of that risk. What should I look for when buying a certified pre-owned vehicle? With any certified pre-owned program, confirm who does the actual inspection and repairs, whether a dealership or the manufacturer. Both original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and dealer-certified program vehicles are usually inspected by employees of the dealership, not by the manufacturer itself. Since warranties, inspection processes and other important details vary by manufacturer, buyers should compare certified pre-owned vehicle programs carefully to make an informed purchase. Where should I look when shopping certified pre-owned vehicles? Whether you know exactly what kind of certified pre-owned vehicle you want or if you're just exploring, you'll want to shop where you have the most options. Further, among the sources that offer you the most certified pre-owned vehicle choices, you'll want a fast, convenient way to sort through the available options. As the world's #1 automotive site (as ranked by Nielsen/NetRatings), eBay Motors offers you the most choices and the best deals available on certified pre-owned vehicles.
