Already this year, companies like Japan’s  Mitsuoka Motor Co  have announced their intentions to build showrooms in China, Porsche debuted its Panamera Turbo at the Shanghai Auto Show, Ferrari created a China-only version of its 599 GTB Fiorano, and  Rolls Royce received 20 orders for its $250,000 Ghost after presenting the automobile in Hong Kong . Now Bugatti , the high performance French automaker, has opened its first-ever showroom outside of France, located on Beijing&#8217;s swanky Jinbao Street. From Alibaba News : &#8220;The opening of the show room, the first one in the  world , shows Bugatti&#8217;s confidence in  China &#8216;s  luxury   car market , &#8220;said Mr Kuo-chung, President of Bugatti China.  Kuo-chung said backed by sustained economic boom, China now has a significant number of  billionaires , pointing to the annual Hurun  Report  which said China now has more known  dollar  billionaires than any other country bar the  United States . &rarr; 1 Comment Posted in Automobile , Business , China , Investment , Luxury Tagged auto , Automobile , beijing , bugatti , China , ferrari , france , Investment , Luxury , luxury automobile , mitsuoka , porsche , rolls-royce , showroom BYD&#8217;s Wang Chuanfu Tops China&#8217;s Rich List On Heels Of BuffettInvestment Posted on September 28, 2009 | Leave a comment Wang Jumps 102 Spots To Head The Hurun Report&#8217;s &#8220;Rich List&#8221;; Now Worth $5.1 Billion BYD&#39;s Wang Chuanfu is now worth over US $5 billion, putting him at the top of China&#39;s &quot;Rich List&quot; Last week, we saw what the endorsement of a financial heavyweight like Warren Buffett can do for a little-known Chinese company, with the stock of Dayang Trands skyrocketing 71% following Buffett&#8217;s praises of the company&#8217;s bespoke suits. In the automotive sector, today China Herald (via Bloomberg ) points out that Buffett&#8217;s investment in previously low-key Chinese battery and hybrid/electric car maker BYD has not only given the brand global visibility, it has made the company&#8217;s head, Wang Chuanfu, a very rich man and putting him at the top of the Hurun Report&#8217;s China Rich List &#8211; beating China&#8217;s longtime #1, Zhang Yin . [Wang's] wealth jumped to $5.1 billion, exceeding Nine Dragons Paper Holdings Ltd. founder Zhang Yin’s $4.9 billion, according to an e-mailed statement from the Hurun Report today.

To Enter ChineseMarket Posted on September 28, 2009 | 1 Comment Japanese Luxury Automaker Plans To Open Beijing Showroom By Q1 2010 The Mitsuoka Orochi will retail for around 800,000 RMB (US $117,177) in China when it arrives next year The growing Chinese luxury market is a prime target for many Asian companies that have found demand in their home countries &#8212; mainly South Korea and Japan &#8212; either growing at a snail&#8217;s pace or simply remaining stagnant . As formerly luxury-mad consumers in traditional markets like Japan cut back on their spending, high-end Japanese companies have started to look abroad for more opportunities, with China remaining the natural choice as a result of its proximity and massive population. Recently, Japan&#8217;s Mitsuoka Motor Co ., one of the country&#8217;s major luxury automakers, announced their plans to enter the Chinese market next year, starting with a showroom in Beijing that is slated to open in April. To lead their China efforts, the company will display their Orochi model at next year&#8217;s Beijing Auto Show and follow up their Beijing strategy with new dealerships in other top-tier cities: The Orochi will spearhead Mitsuoka&#8217;s debut into China. The company plans to display the car at next year&#8217;s Beijing Auto Show, and to open dealerships in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.

China Car times notes that the potential joint venture would have a target production rate of 40,000 vehicles per year. While the laws surrounding foreign-Chinese joint ventures are somewhat murky &#8212; with conflicting reports suggesting that foreign companies are unable to form more than one such venture in China at a time (a potential problem for Daimler, which is already linked with Beijing Auto Works ) &#8212; China Daily&#8217;s report seems relatively optimistic that the Mercedes-Brilliance alliance will move ahead: Continue reading &rarr; &rarr; Leave a comment Posted in Automobile , Business , China , Investment , Luxury Tagged Automobile , automotive , brilliance , China , daimler , mercedes Lamborghini CEO: China To Overtake Italy Within 3-5Years Posted on June 11, 2009 | 2 Comments Luxury Carmaker Looks To Chinese Market For Sustained Growth Over Other Emerging Markets Like Russia China has become one of Lamborghini&#39;s top markets after only four years in the Mainland There has been quite a bit of news this week about predictions by the CEO of Lamborghini that China will overtake Italy as the second-largest market in the world for Lamborghini within three to five years , trailing only the United States. Lamborghini has aggressively sought growth in the Mainland market since opening its first dealership in Shanghai in 2005 . The company&#8217;s expansion in this potentially vast market has been meteoric, with Chinese sales expected to account for much of Lamborghini&#8217;s Asian sales by 2012. While much of this comes down to the reduced demand for ultra-expensive autos in developed markets, it has been bolstered by Lamborghini&#8217;s sustained efforts to build a strong foothold in China, an effort that has been helped by an existing taste for expensive European goods. As Reuters illustrates , Lamborghini is banking on a continued appetite for expensive European brands in the Mainland market, and has sent managers to China with the express task of cutting through any obstacles that still remain to reaching as many wealthy buyers as possible: Continue reading &rarr; &rarr; 2 Comments Posted in Automobile , Business , China , Economy , Luxury Tagged Automobile , brand , China , europe , lamborghini , Luxury , wealthy GM And China A Time-TestedFit Posted on May 31, 2009 | 1 Comment The American Automaker Is Enjoying Record Gains In China&#8217;s Rapidly-Growing Automotive Market, Despite Difficulties At Home GM has enjoyed record success in China over the past four years. But will domestic upstarts like BYD woo Chinese car buyers away? Photo © BusinessWeek With GM&#8217;s impending bankruptcy and restructuring in the news over the last week, it is easy to lose sight of the company&#8217;s global reach and mixed revenues. Although the company has had unprecedented difficulties in the North American market, brought on by the global economic downturn, in China &#8212; where the company has operated (with a roughly 30-year interruption) for decades &#8212; GM has been the leading foreign carmaker for the last four years. Although China&#8217;s domestic car makers &#8212; spurred by huge foreign and government investment over the past few years &#8212; are making great strides , since the formation of the Shanghai GM joint venture in 1997, the company has worked hard to rebrand itself for the China market. All of this work has paid off in China, since as of last year, GM built an estimated market share of 12.1% on sales of nearly to 1.1 million units.

With the sluggish performance of carmakers in more developed global markets, the news that auto shares in China &#8212; currently the world&#8217;s biggest car market &#8212; are expected to outperform this year will, in many ways, comfort global auto companies. However, as we have previously discussed , the news that Chinese car buyers are growing rapidly as a consumer base shouldn&#8217;t be enough for foreign automakers &#8212; as domestic brands like BYD, Geely, Chery and others vie for dominance in this rapidly-changing market, foreign automakers will have to invest heavily if they are to keep the lead they have built in the last 10-20 years.

This represents a very significant change in tactic on the part of Chinese automakers, who until recently had all but given up on this consumer bracket, apparently convinced that it would be impossible to compete with foreign luxury carmakers like Mercedes and BMW , two brands that have made commanding inroads in the China market.
