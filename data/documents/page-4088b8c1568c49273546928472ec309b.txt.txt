How about DIY flurries?<p>A flurry is simple - and it isn't something you can only get at the ice cream shop. You start off with ice cream, usually a basic flavor, then you stir or mix or blend all kinds of things into it. It's not a float; no liquid is added. It's like an ice cream sundae, but with the toppings blended in instead of piled on top.<p>Most ice cream shops start with soft serve because it mixes so easily. Since most of us don't have soft serve machines in our kitchens (If only!!!), we suggest using a machine you probably do have - a microwave.<p>Start with a pint of ice cream. Remove the lid and microwave it for about 10 seconds. Test it with a spoon. The ice cream should still be frozen, but should give when pressed with the back of the spoon. If it's not ready, continue microwaving in 5-second bursts, testing in between.<p>Now you're ready to mix. You can keep it simple and just use a spoon to mix the ice cream and toppings in a bowl. But where's the fun in that? Ice cream shops often use a stick blender, another item you may not have. So instead, toss everything into the food processor and pulse a few times.<p>As for what to use to flavor your flurries? Anything goes. And pile in as many as you can. The more you add, the more delicious it becomes. <p>To help you get started, we've come up with a bunch of ideas for delicious, chilly flurries.<p>•<b>Snowstorm:</b> vanilla ice cream, Peppermint Pattie candies, crushed peppermint sticks, a few drops of mint extract<p>•<b>Cocoa beach:</b> chocolate ice cream, toasted macadamia nuts, toasted coconut, hot fudge sauce<p>•<b>Satisfaction: </b>sweet cream ice cream, crushed salted peanuts, caramel sauce, chopped Snickers candy<p>•<b>Berry basket:</b> black raspberry ice cream, chopped fresh strawberries, blueberries, raspberries<p>•<b>Concession stand: </b>vanilla ice cream, chocolate sandwich cookies, crushed pretzels, gummy bears, M&M's, caramel sauce, malted milk balls<p>•<b>Silver screen:</b> vanilla ice cream, caramel popcorn, chocolate-covered peanuts<p>•<b>Campfire:</b> vanilla ice cream, crushed chocolate covered graham crackers, chopped smoked almonds, chopped marshmallows, hot fudge sauce<p>•<b>Ultimate peanut: </b>chocolate ice cream, peanut butter sauce, chopped Butter-finger candy bar, chopped Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, salted peanuts, peanut butter M&M's<p>•<b>Dark horse cherry: </b>chocolate ice cream, chop-ped maraschino cherries, crushed chocolate sandwich cookies, finely chop-ped espresso chocolate<p>•<b>Melba:</b> raspberry swirl ice cream, chopped peaches, fresh raspberries, finely chopped candied ginger<p>•<b>Trail mix:</b> sweet cream ice cream, toasted pecans, granola, dried cranberries, mini chocolate chips<p>•<b>Banshee:</b> coffee ice cream, bananas, toasted almonds, cinnamon, crushed toffee<p>•<b>Malted cookie: </b>chocolate ice cream, malted milk balls, crushed vanilla wafer cookies, toasted almonds<bullend>   Savvy Senior: Music therapy for Alzheimer's patients  Dear Savvy Senior: What can you tell me aboutmusic therapy for Alzheimer&#39;s patients?
