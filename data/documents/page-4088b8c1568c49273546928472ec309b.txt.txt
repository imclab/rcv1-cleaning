 In ancient times B.V.G. (Before Video Games), here&#39;s how
kids played: Take all your toys - dolls, soldiers, cars, blocks,
that thing you got from a cereal box - and dump them on the floor.
Forget about logic or plot consistency because the most important
goal is to create an entertaining adventure. (My neighborhood is
still reeling from the sordid G.I. Joe-Barbie affair of 1974.)

 NEW YORK - Forest Whitaker tends to talk about his work with a

 When I&#39;ve had enough of the heat, humidity and bugs during
the dog days of summer, sometimes I just need an altitude
adjustment. That&#39;s when I start barking and plan a getaway to
the North Georgia mountain town of Blue Ridge.

 Dear Abby : My husband, &quot;Ray,&quot; and I

husband who works hard, is responsible, healthy, and he does half

 When Bear Bryant ordered University of Alabama freshman Joe
Namath to climb up the coach&#39;s tower high atop the practice

 Even those of us who have yet to date and break up with John
Mayer may find &quot;Paradise Valley&quot; unlikeable. Kids are apt
to spend some time with the hummable tunes before moving on to more

 When it comes to travel plans that get disrupted, some are out
of our control (Mother Nature, dissent in the country you&#39;re

you&#39;ve overslept and missed your flight).

 Question : My ex-boyfriend and I both agreed upon a no-contact rule when we split so we could both heal and move on. The breakup was amicable enough; we split because he was uncertain about his career path and wanted time to figure out what he wants and if he even wanted a life partner. I'm 30 and desire a family, and he didn't want to waste my time while he figures those things out.
