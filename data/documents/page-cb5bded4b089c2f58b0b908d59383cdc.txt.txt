Despite thatfact, however, an imaginative, written literature which could beconsidered indigenous did not develop in Newfoundland until wellinto the present century. Quodlibets.

(32 kb) In the intervening years a richfolk literature&#8212;a traditional literature dependant on the spokenrather than the written word and circulated by word of mouth andcustomary practice&#8212;developed and flourished alongside the morefamiliar forms of written expression. Among the genres of oralliterature to be found in the Newfoundland context are folksongsand ballads, folk drama, proverbs, rhymes, riddles, jokes,recitations and monologues, local legends, personal experiencenarratives, and folktales. Some of these forms of folkliterature, which sustained the aesthetic needs and provided anoutlet for the creative energies of a large percentage ofNewfoundlanders for four centuries, have been extensivelycollected and studied in recent times, and there has also been arevival of interest in the performance of others. All of themhave had a remarkable impact on contemporary written literaturein Newfoundland.

Pratt published his NewfoundlandVerse and a convenient if arbitrary date to select as astarting point for a discussion of the emergence of an indigenousliterature&#8212;saw the publication of a considerable amount andvariety of popular and scholarly writing dealing with life in theprovince written by non-native missionaries, colonial officials,historians, sportsmen, adventurers, travellers, and others. E. J. Pratt, ca. 1930. Edwin John Pratt (1882-1964) was born in Western Bay, Conception Bay. After leaving the province in 1907 to attend the University of Toronto, he published his first volume of poetry, Newfoundland Verse , in 1923. From David G. Pitt, E. J.

(13 kb) A large number of journalists wrote for an equally large number ofnewspapers, magazines, and periodicals during the 19thcentury, and around the turn of the present century, localpropagandists and promoters produced a great deal of writingwhich depicted Newfoundland as a haven for tourists,health-seekers and sportsmen. The literature which began toemerge during the second quarter of this century was markedlyresponsive and particularly reactive to the radical social,cultural, and political changes which marked the period. Thelocal authors who produced this literature either drew heavily,both for form and content, on the oral culture, or attempted toignore that in favour of emulating more cosmopolitan trends andthemes. Most of the writers, however, shared a notable tendencyto examine the nature of life in Newfoundland and to articulatewhat are deemed to be its essential qualities. This, in turn,gave rise to a protracted debate in the literature over therelative merits of what was perceived to be the traditionalculture and its role in the life of the province generally. Eventhose writers who were the most self-consciously cosmopolitan inoutlook and literary taste, and who had little or no firsthandexperience of the traditional culture seemed unable to avoiddealing with it, usually in negative terms. On the other hand, agroup of less self-consciously literary, practically-mindedwriters tended toward an idealization and romanticization of thetraditional culture in their writings. These opposing trendstended to abate somewhat after the 1970s, but even todayNewfoundland literature draws heavily on the particulars andpeculiarities of Newfoundland history and society.
