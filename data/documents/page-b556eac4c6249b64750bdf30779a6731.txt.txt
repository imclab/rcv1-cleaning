                                I don't know what kind of musicians you're talking about. But musicians are the main ones who see Thicke's theft for what it is. Look up Nicholas Payton[...]  continue

                        Billionaire Dan Loeb Gets Artsy: Third Point Goes Activist On Sotheby's
                     
 
 
 
 
 
 
                 Activist hedge fund manager Dan Loeb targeted auction house Sotheby's on Monday, buying more than 5% and announcing his intention to engage management.

                        Is This Blue Diamond Worth $9.8 Million?
                     
 
 
 
 
 
 
                 This cut-corned, modified brilliant cut, natural fancy blue diamond has a VVS1 clarity grade, notable for having “very, very slight” inclusions, according to the report from the Gemological Institute of America. The magic ingredient in natural blue diamonds is boron, which this gem has. Fewer than 0.3 percent of all colored diamonds graded by GIA were predominately blue.

                 "In these pictures all that is good about photography has been neglected, and the shortcomings of the art are prominently exhibited," reported The Photographic Journal in an 1864 article about Julia Margaret Cameron's "out-of-focus portraits" of the leading poets and scientists of her age. "We are sorry to have to speak thus severely on the works of a lady, but we feel compelled to do so in the interest of the art." The Photographic Journal had a point. Rather than trying to suppress the chemical[...]

                        Breaking Bad Episode 511: Recap, Explanations And A Timeline
                     
 
 
 
 
 
 
                 This morning in Breaking Bad Land there seems to be much flat-out confusion about what happened at the end of last night's episode 511.Which is totally understandable. Because much of the crucial action of the back story concerning Jesse's revelation about Walter poisoning Brock takes place off camera at the end of season four. Here's a step by step explanation of what happened in 511, and the Season 4 events leading up to it.

                        Neil Young's Pono Music Service Illustrates Hi-Def Audio's Problems
                     
 
 
 
 
 
 
                 There’s widespread industry speculation that Neil Young’s dream of a higher quality consumer music service is slowly getting closer, although a launch date is still nowhere in sight. Pono, in which Young is heavily invested, is a high-resolution audio ecosystem consisting of a download service supplying digital audio files transferred from the original audio masters at 192kHz/24 bit, and a dedicated player with the ability to play back those files at that resolution. Along with Apple’s best kept[...]

                        We Need More EdTech, But Less Technology In The Classroom
                     
 
 
 
 
 
 
                 Technology plays a primary role in my teaching, but I rarely turn on the computer that makes the classroom “smart.”
Occasionally, I project the class tweet stream. I am an advocate of Twitter for higher ed. But generally, during class time, I try to avoid mediating my connection with students through technology. Face-to-face time is reserved for facilitating old fashioned conversation and discussion. Outside of class, however, my students are bombarded with digital learning resources.
