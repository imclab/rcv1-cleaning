Whether your car needs basic scheduled maintenance, a simple fix, or major overhaul, we are a state of the art car repair shop that can repair your automobile at the absolute lowest prices! We know that auto repair can be difficult and is often an unexpected burden on a familyâs budget so we offer low cost financing for our auto repairs. How do we get our prices lower than our competitors? We can charge less, because in order to accurately perform an automotive repair, you must first know the "correct" part to replace. Many repair shops will replace an entire engine or transmission to fix a problem that we can fix by just replacing a sensor, or repairing shorted wiring. To determine exactly what your car needs, our certified technicians use the latest equipment to diagnosis your cars problem. Diagnostics is our specialty! We do more performance diagnostics than any other auto repair shop in San Antonio. Today's engines are a hybrid of combustion and electronics and many repair shops don't have the equipment and the expertise to diagnosis today's complex automotive performance problems. Many people still believe that a "tune up" will fix a performance problem, but todayâs cars are computerized, so a simple tune up is often not enough to fix a performance problem. Todayâs tune ups begin with a computer code scan to determine which system of your vehicle is reporting a problem. Many auto mechanics then guess at repairs which is what causes car repair to be so expensive and so time consuming. Having the proper auto diagnostic equipment and skilled automotive mechanics is what makes us San Antonioâs best automotive repair shop! Because this is our area of expertise, we are often referred complex performance issues from other auto repair shops. We guarantee that we can correctly diagnosis your vehicle's problem or the diagnostic is free! And we offer a 3 year/36000 mile warranty on most repairs.
