There's a choice of excellent petrol and diesel engines, and resale values are strong. Against  Rear-seat and boot space are compromised by the folding roof. Prices are high. What Car? says div class="rating"> <span>  out of 5 stars</span> </div 4 4 5 stars The BMW 3 Series Convertible is good to drive, and refined with the roof up or down.

Even the four-cylinder petrol and diesel models are refined and perform strongly. The sweet spot of the range is the 325i SE â&euro;&ldquo; quick enough to be exciting, with a great exhaust note, too. Fuel economy is good for such a swift petrol car, while company car drivers will find that low emissions keep the taxman at bay. There are two trim levels. The less-expensive version is the SE, which is well equipped as standard. M Sport models have extra goodies including sport suspension, but this makes for a rather firm ride. Weâ&euro;&trade;d save a few pounds and take the SE. Inclusive servicing packages are available, which make for easier budgeting and will help sell the car on, since they still apply to subsequent owners. All models have good resale values, although the larger-engined petrol models arenâ&euro;&trade;t quite as strong.
