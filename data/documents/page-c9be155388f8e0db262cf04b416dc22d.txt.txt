The BMW 3 Series Coupe is practical for a two-door car, too, with lots of space for four and a reasonable boot. Against  The conservative looks mean this is more of a two-door saloon than a striking coupe. The ride is a little on the firm side, too. What Car? says div class="rating"> <span>  out of 5 stars</span> </div 4 4 5 stars Strong performance, sensible running costs, impressive practicality and fine handling make the BMW 3 Series Coupe a great car, provided you like the understated looks.

Our favourite is the 335i. Why spend nearly half as much again on an M3 when the 335i is so quick? On a more modest budget and with an eye on the tax bill for company car drivers, the 320d is a compelling car, but to be honest, there isnâ&euro;&trade;t a bad model in the range. Thereâ&euro;&trade;s a choice of SE and M Sport specifications. SE comes with a long list of standard equipment and costs much less, so itâ&euro;&trade;s the one weâ&euro;&trade;d recommend. On the other hand, M Sport models have sportier looks and stiffened suspension for the ultimate in handling. Itâ&euro;&trade;s worth buying one of BMWâ&euro;&trade;s inclusive servicing packages, which will make the car easier to sell on.
