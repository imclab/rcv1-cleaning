The fact is, not every Lincoln vehicle can make the cut as a Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicle. Only after an exhaustive selection process do we certify it. Why should I consider a Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned luxury vehicle? Three words – peace of mind. Before your vehicle is delivered, it receives a unique 200-point inspection. Any item(s) that does not pass our standards is replaced or repaired with a factory-authorized part. On top of that, every Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicle comes with limited warranty coverage, * optional upgrade coverage and other exclusive benefits. * See your dealer for warranty coverage details. What qualifies a vehicle to be Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned? Every carefully selected Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned luxury vehicle has to meet stringent requirements: There must be fewer than 60,000 miles on the odometer. An exhaustive 200-point inspection covering everything from exterior and interior to underhood and underbody areas is performed; any part(s) that doesn’t pass is repaired or replaced with a factory-authorized part. To identify potential issues, a CARFAX ® Vehicle History Report&#153; is run to identify issues such as accident history and frame, flood and fire damage. Who certifies my Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicle? Each vehicle is thoroughly inspected by a team of factory-trained Lincoln Dealer technicians. Where can I shop for Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicles? They’re available exclusively at your local Lincoln Dealer.  Why is a CARFAX ® Vehicle History Report&#153; so important? If a vehicle has been damaged, it may not meet our standards. That’s why we run a CARFAX Vehicle History Report to identify any potential issues, such as: Flood vehicle Fire damage Frame damage Salvage vehicle Branded title Odometer issues Accident history Vehicle title history Is financing available? Yes, you can finance the purchase of your Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicle through Lincoln Automotive Financial Services. It provides competitive incentives and offers.  How long is the limited warranty coverage on my Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicle? Coverage for all Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicles includes repair or replacement of covered components for six years from the original Lincoln New-Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage start date or up to 100,000 miles on the odometer, whichever comes first. How comprehensive is my warranty? Coverage includes parts and labor, but excludes wear-and-tear items. This includes more than 500 components, including many high-tech parts. What is my deductible? Each Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicle has a standard deductible of only $100. Is additional coverage available? Yes, on top of the standard six-year/100,000-mile warranty, optional Lincoln Extended Service Plan Packages are available. If I sell my Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicle, is the warranty still good? With our Subsequent Owner Warranty, should you choose to sell your Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicle, the remaining Lincoln comprehensive limited warranty coverage remains in effect for the new owner. This is a little extra that could enhance the resale value.  What is included in my complimentary 24-Hour Roadside Assistance? Unlike a used vehicle, your Certified Pre-Owned vehicle is covered with towing assistance of up to $100 for warranty and non-warranty problems, including accidents (excludes impound and repossession). You can also count on help with flat-tire changes, up to two gallons of fuel at no charge if your vehicle runs out of gas, on-site jump starts, and lockout assistance. Where can I get my Lincoln Certified Pre-Owned vehicle serviced? Your Lincoln Dealer will repair, replace or service all components covered under your vehicle’s limited warranty coverage. What if I have more questions? Call our Lincoln Customer Relationship Center toll-free at (800) 521-4140 during the following times: Monday &ndash; Friday 8:00am &ndash; 8:00pm EST Saturday 9:00am &ndash; 5:30pm EST Close Welcome AXZ Plan participant.
