We regularly drove the eye-catching, metallic blue,show-boating, big car down the full length of Christopher Street fromGreenwich Avenue to West Street (West Side Highway) at the Hudson Riverin Greenwich Village, New York -- and still do -- and many Gay andother people yelled out -- and still do -- "The 'Stonewall Car'"!     #6 Thetrue blue "Stonewall Car" at night and, from a downward angle,looking coupey! {Thatcrease caused byamayoral vehicle wasremoved whencar was restored in1999.} [Photo by Terri Van Dyke]    =historyof the "Stonewall Car"= Those original participants andobservers readily recognized thecool, unique, stand-out, metallic blue, big Cadillac convertible,one-and-only car impounded ("hijacked") by the New York City PoliceDepartment ("NYCPD") on the first night of the Stonewall Rebellion (it was not a'riot' -- no vandalism, no injuries, not one auto insurance claim) on Friday night, June 27th, 1969 atabout 2 a.m. The car with the top 'down' had been parked, as usual,on the same block of the Stonewall Club on Christopher Street -- reallyonly a stone's throw from the club's entrance. The car was driven(not towed, as many think) bytwo un-uniformed NYCPD policeofficers to the old Sixth Precinct on Charles Streetnear theHudson River in Greenwich Village. Fortunately, theeventwas a 'rebellion' and not a 'riot' or the car would havebeen definitely damaged or possibly destroyed. There would havealso been a huge amount of other automobileinsurance claims.In reality, there were no insurance claims by anyone for anything-- not even a scratch. #7 1959 Edsel and 1969 Cadillac leading a N.Y.C. Gay Pride Parade [Digital Photography by Hal Weiner] Aquarter-of-a-century later on January 1, 1994, the 1969"Stonewall Car" officially was bestowed with "vintage" automobilestatus in accordance with the New York State Department of MotorVehicles' requirements and guidelines. A vehicle must be at least25 years since production. It is ironic that this silvermilestone for the historiccar occurred in the exact yearof "Stonewall 25". Remember, the car and therebellion were born in the same year! Throughout the Springof 1994, the "Stonewall Car", with actual veterans of the 1969Stonewall Rebellion, was on display at seemingly endless events,celebrations, commemorations and even Gay clubs and restaurants hosting"SW-25" parties and dinners and churches memorializing this historicanniversary. On "Stonewall Sunday", June 26, 1994, the "StonewallCar" was in the New York Sunday News (with a circulation of nearly one million), describing thehistory ofthe car vis-a-vis the Stonewall Rebellion. The only Gay newspaperin New York City at that time was the New York Native , whichassigned a reporter to the car, the Stonewall veterans, the "alternate"march and the S.V.A. at the huge rally for the entire day. The New York Times described the "Stonewall Car" as "... in mint condition".That is the supreme automotive complement!  #8 Upfront and up close: the unmistakeable 1969 Cadillacconvertible [Photo by Marlon W. Hurt] #9 S.V.A.eventflyer for an external'restoration' benefit for 1969 "Stonewall Car" [Design by Shari Clemons at Liz J. Abzug Consultant Services] ="StonewallCar" leads "Stonewall-25"= The beautiful, blue acrylic lacquer 1969 "Stonewall Car" ledthe 1994 "Spirit of Stonewall March" from the legendary Stonewall Clubin Greenwich Village, New York, through some narrow streets passing thehistoric Washington Square Arch, with the huge Twin Towers of the WorldTrade Center in the distant background, all the way up Fifth Avenuewith cheering spectators, to Central Park. At the Avenue of theAmericas and West 59th Street entrance to the park is where the twohuge marches came face to face. There was a loud street 'debate'from the heads of both as to which march should enter first.That, to a historically-correct, respectful, prideful person wasa no-brainer. Basically, we were just sitting a spell in thesunny light with people gratefully taking pix of the car saying to eachother that "...ain't no onegonna be goin' into that park on thisglorious day before this classicand beautiful 1969 Cadillacconvertible "Stonewall Car". It was ultimately 'decided' that themarch with the historic 1969 "Stonewall Car", theSTONEWALLVeterans' Association,the Imperial QUEENS of NewYork, et al. would go first. The decison was actually enforcedand put into action when a queen -- the Queen -- issued a royalwarning: Watch out! -- or you'll get run over by thetwo-and-a-half ton "Stonewall Car". So, this famous car now leadhundreds of thousands of GLBT people and theirfriends andsupporters into the park, where hundreds of thousands had alreadycongregated in anticipation of the biggest GLBT rally in history.Have you ever brought your car to be part of an event with a realmillion people? The "Stonewall Car" was the only car in the entire Central Park that glorious day -- along with about1.1 million people. #10 New York State Registration Cardfor the 1969"Stonewall Car" The vehicle identification number (VIN) has, of course, been deleted.  #11 After a parade,the 1969 Cadillac "Stonewall Car" on HudsonStreet in Greenwich Village The 1969 Cadillac DeVille convertible "Stonewall Car" isproudly owned, diligently maintained, safely garaged, fully insured andcarefully cleaned by the STONEWALL Veterans' Association ("S.V.A.").Years after the Stonewall Rebellion, theappropriate licenseplate for the "Stonewall Car" was secured: "STONEWAL". InNew York State you can only have eight characters (letters and/ornumbers) on a license plate. The saved last "L" is for"Liberators". #12 Accommodating note from the local Sixth Precinct of the New York CityPolice Dep't #13 1969 Cadillac "Stonewall Car" on display at theNewYorkCityConvention Center [Photo by Williamson Henderson] Thecost of garaging this historic, valuable, classic car is about $400 permonth in a solid, secure and convenient Manhattan, New York, garage,that is, totaling nearly$5,000 per year. And, that is justfor the garaging of the car!There is also auto insurance,maintenance, license plates,registration and sometimes a repair. The "StonewallCar"is one of the many worthwhile reasons why the S.V.A. mustupkeep its fund-raising throughout the year. Otherwise, therewould be no irreplaceable"Stonewall Car" for the future --starting tomorrow! #14 New York Daily News does a popularstory on the1969 Cadillac "Stonewall Car". USSenator Daniel Moynihan declaredtheSW-Car"A rolling symbol of Gay Pride"! [Article by Tara Crosson] #15 Roadblocking -- with permission of the NYCPD Note: In the purple shirt is Vito Abzuzzoluccione. [Photo by Leigh McManus of the S.V.A. in Manhattan]  =background 411 on the 1969 Cadillac= For you car buffs, and other interested parties, here are some veryinteresting factoids regarding the 1969 Cadillac DeVille convertible.General Motors Corporation (GMC) described this Cadillacasits "crown jewel". Right they were! Its weight is over4,600 pounds (nearly 2 1/2 tons!); its length is 225 inches (nearly 19feet long!); its width is 80 inches (over 6 1/2 feet wide); its heightis 55 inches (with convertible top up); its wheelbase (the distancebetween axles) is 130 inches; and its massive, powerful,fuel-efficient, 375 horsepower, V-8 engine is 472 cubic inches at 4,400r.p.m. (revolutions per minute). It is the largest V-8 engineever produced to power a passenger car! The Cadillachas thegreat standard-equipped power steering, power brakes, six-waypower bench seat, power windows, A.M./F.M. stereo radio, power radioantenna and, most importantly, power convertible top. Theconvertible top is made of white, triple-woven padded canvas with areal glass rear window. One option the car has which we rarelyuse is the "automatic climate control system". When is the topup? Never! No, not even in winter. The cariskept with the top down year-round and a custom canvas cover over it.The seating areas are white sierra ostrich-grain leather.The flooring is midnight black pile carpeting. Thedashboard, door panels and rear seating area side panels have inlaid,designer grain wood. The entire car interior is original!The custom Vogue tires are extra-wide whitewalls. The wheelcovers are solid chrome spokes. The fuel tank capacity is awhopping 26 gallons (plus one gallon reserve). The locked gas capis hidden behind the rear license plate ("STONEWAL"). #16 Cadillac hastraditionally led theparade! [Photo by a United Kingdom Promotional Agency] =more411: 1969 Cadillac= Over 16,000 of these classic Cadillac convertible cars -- avery large number for a luxury convertible -- were produced by GeneralMotors Corporation with "Body by Fisher". The huge chrome bumpersand massive front with cast aluminum "egg-crate" grille was used as adesign model for Cadillac grilles for the following two-plus decadesinto the 1990s. The car front debuted the innovative andsafety-conscious wraparound cornering lights (now found, though lessgrandly, on almost every car). 1969 was the year that front seatheadrests (restraints) became mandatory by law. Seatbelts werenow required to have a push-button open/close mechanism. The 1969Cadillac marked the public-wanted return of the dual horizontalheadlights (after four years of the vertical, un-Cadillac, 'stacked'headlamps). (See "SW-30" on the S.V.A. website "Photo Album" iconfor pix of a 1966 blue Cadillac convertible, periodically withthe S.V.A. in the parades.) In 1959, back-tracking a decade,Cadillac had the incredibly unique, "bullet" tail-lights. Tenyears later, it seems that they made a point to have the 1969 taillamps be unique. 1969 was the only year that the Cadillac had thedistinctive "lantern" tail-lights. They complemented and werebuilt-in to the slowly sweeping, modified tail fin. For anexcellent foto of the tail lamps, see the Greenwich Village, New Yorkphoto on Greenwich Avenue at Jackson Triangle Parkbelow.In fact, virtually the only difference between the 1969 and the1970 Cadillacs (same body, same size, same stats, etc.) were thetail-lights.The 1970 returned to the Cadillac's well-known, long, verticaltail-lights.The 1969 and 1970 Cadillacs (98% identical twins) were widelydescribed as "muscle cars with tuxedos". It is most appropriatethat the 1969 is both distinctive and 'different'. The ad sloganfor the 1969 Cadillac was: "The pleasure of driving the onlyluxury convertible built in America!" Over three decades later,that horn slogan still blows true -- and with even greatersignificance! #17 A"Stonewall Car" prior New York license plate: " STONEWAL " [Photo by New York State Dep't of Motor Vehicles]  #18 "Happy Tails" 2 U! [Photo by BronwynIshii] =questions and answers:"Stonewall Cadillac"= The mostfrequently asked questionabout the "StonewallCar" (SW-Car) is: "What is the mileage?" At the turn of themillennium (2000), theSW-Car had anoriginal mileage of94,169on New Year's Day. It continued to stay in the heated garageuntil June! The mileage was only 94,894 original miles threeyears lateras of January 1, 2003, actually regarded as a very lowfigure considering the vehicular age. At35 years, as ofApril 1, 2004, the mileage was only 94,954. OnJune 11,2005,the odometer read alow 95,169. Again, threeyears later, at the end of June in 2008, the mileage is merely 95,233.Sincethe car did not do a few parades for various reasons -- includingpredicted thunderstorms,lightning and rain downpours -- in thepast four years (as of mid-May 2013), theSW-Cardrove lessthan 40miles! In mid-2013 after the annual New York City GLBT PrideParade, the original mileage is only 95,386. Inthe lastdozen years less than1,000 mileshave beenadded to this restricted-mileage "historical" vehicle. An interesting question asked is: Was the "Stonewall Car" held bythe police as 'evidence'? No! Evidence of what? -- otherthan the fact that Williamson Henderson, the car's owner, was there.After all, there was no crime and, thus, no 'evidence'. Another often-asked querrie is how long did the NYCPD have (illegal)possession of the car? It was for two nights (June 27 and 28,1969) and the day in between. It was a "P.O.W."! Thankfully,it was rescued and there was absolutely no damage to the beauty.And, considering that the NYCPD are known as"the boys inblue" and the car is police blue, we're lucky we ever got it back fromthem! Is the engine the original? Yes, it sure is -- andabsolutely nothing overhauled. It even has the original glasswindow cleaner bottle and mount adjacent to the engine! Needlessto say, the engine is huge! #19 Classic car with classic people evoking an historic classiccarscene [Photo by Williamson Henderson] To many people who have written to the S.V.A., the above photo of thevery classic convertible car evokesa well-knownhistoriccar scene fromthe early1960s -- long before this 1969 car was even built!

It was usedin the promotional poster for both the premiere of "Stonewall:ThePlay" in 1994 and "Stonewall" (the movie) in 1996. Since the"Stonewall Car" hada professionalexterior restoration inmid-1999, S.V.A. members voted unanimously to again make the caravailable (after a 20-year hiatus) to be 'leased' -- with S.V.A.supervision -- for films, commercials, print ads, editorials andvideos. We had a pendingarrangement recently for the frontpage of a design magazine; however, they didn't want to pay anything!?The yuppies thought it would be enough for people to see the caron the cover!
