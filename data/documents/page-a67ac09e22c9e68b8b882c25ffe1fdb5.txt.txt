Myers built all of the furniture by hand with his father&#8217;s help. A 1947 Mercury coupe fitted with a 1946 Ford grille and a surfboard roof resembles a woodie wagon and acts as the reception desk, while a 1956 Olds 98 and a pink 1959 Cadillac have been made into couches. Myers&#8217; fondness for the work of legendary custom painter and pinstriper Larry Watson was the inspiration behind recreating Watson&#8217;s shop as his private office. Even his office desk is a tribute to Watson&#8217;s candy-and-white pearl 1959 Caddy.
