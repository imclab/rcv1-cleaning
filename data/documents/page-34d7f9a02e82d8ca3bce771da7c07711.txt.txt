Read more after the jump. ... "In the Flesh" tells a zombie story from the zombie's point of view. Kieren Walker (Luke Newberry, above) is a zombie in the process of being reformed. He suffers from PDS (partially deceased syndrome, at right) and through medicine he's being treated for his zombie conditioned and being returned to his home and family, much to the chagrin of some protestors who don't want even "cured" zombies in their community. "In the Flesh" offers a fresh, clever take on the zombie story; it could almost be a sequel to "The Walking Dead" in a time after a cure has been found (there's also less blood and gore than seen in "TWD"). "In the Flesh" also offers a fictional take on real-world reactions to "others" moving into a community, whether it's the other by nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation or convicted felons. A NIMBY (Not In My BackYard) spirit abides in the townspeople featured in "In the Flesh." On the home front, Kieren must get reacquainted with his family, including his sister, who's part of the Rotter-hating Human Volunteer Force, which took down zombies prior to the creation of a cure. Kieren also deals with his own guilt for the atrocities he committed while in his zombie state. This three-part series airs at 10 p.m. nightly, Thursday through Saturday.
