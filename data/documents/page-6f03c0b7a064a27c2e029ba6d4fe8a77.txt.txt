   Cheap Cars How and Where to Find the Cheapest Cars Cheap cars can be found and purchased from a variety of sources. Generally, people who are looking for cheap cars are simply attempting to find the best car that meets their needs, at the lowest possible cost. For those who are looking for inexpensive cars, there are essentially three categories of options available to them &#8212; cheap new cars , cheap used cars , and cheap leased cars . Let's focus mainly on used or pre-owned cars. Used cars at low prices are available from dealers, individuals, auctions, and on the Internet. Considerable care must be taken when buying pre-owned cars because most are sold &quot;as-is&quot; and will come without a guarantee or warranty. Certified Cars offered by dealers are used cars with short warranties, but can be more expensive. Following are the best places to find cheap cars for sale: Used-Cars at New-Car Dealers - Most new-car dealers typically sell both new cars and pre-owned cars. Although inexpensive cars can often be found on these lots, most new-car dealers only offer late model used vehicles that have been taken in trade or are off-lease, and are in good condition &#8212; and are relatively expensive. Older, less expensive vehicles are usually sent to auction to be purchased by independent used-car dealers (see below) and BHPH dealers (see below). Therefore, check your local new-car dealers when looking for a cheap used car but also look at other sources listed below. Independent Used-Car Dealers - Independent used-car lots (not associated with a new-car dealer) are a potential source of affordable cheap second hand cars. Many lots have older vehicles that can be real bargains. However, proper caution should be taken to determine if the price is fair and that the vehicle has no hidden problems. Most used cars are sold &quot;as-is&quot; and come without any kind of warranty or return policy. See Buying a Used Car for more details. Consignment Lots - Many towns and cities have used-car consignment lots which can be a good source of inexpensive vehicles. Sellers display their cars-for-sale on the consignment lot for a fee. Lot managers are often authorized by car owners to negotiate prices with potential buyers, or buyers may be directed back to the seller to discuss prices. Buy-Here-Pay-Here (BHPH) Dealers - A special type of independent used-car dealer that provides in-house financing , usually with no credit check. Most BHPH dealers are local and can be recognized by their &quot;we finance anyone&quot; or &quot;no credit check&quot; banners. Be aware that interest rates are usually very high and payment terms are strict. National Used-Car Dealers - If you live in an area that has a Carmax car superstore, this is one of the largest, most reputable used-car dealers in the country, and a good source of fair no-hassle deals &#8212; although not necessarily the cheapest deals. They inspect the cars they sell, provide a money-back guarantee, and provide a limited warranty. Many people consider Carmax cars to be a bit overpriced, but you get a little extra peace of mind for the money. New-Car Bargains - Don't overlook this year's (or last year's) brand new cars as a potential source of good bargains. There are currently tons of heavy rebates and other incentives being offered by car manufacturers , especially on domestic brands, and especially on last year's models, that can often make certain new cars temporarily less expensive than used cars of the same make and model. See New Car Rebates and Incentives . UsedCars.com - UsedCars.com is the Internet's largest used car buying service , with over a half a million used car listings.

This allows you to drive a brand new car for the same or less money than you might spend on a late model used car. You can look at special promotional lease deals at Best Car Deals . The deals are genuinely good deals but you should make sure you can live with the term (usually 36 months), the annual mileage limit (usually 10K-12K miles per year), and the down payment, if any.
