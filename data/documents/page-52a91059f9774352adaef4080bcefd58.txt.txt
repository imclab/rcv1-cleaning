And whether the first cold snap is only weeks or still months away, this is a great time to take advantage of the milder fall weather by popping the hood and winterizing your car. A task that is critical to fall car care is cooling system maintenance. A recent survey by the National Car Care Council showed that more than 70 percent of motorists do not winterize their cars in preparation for the colder months ahead. Perhaps that's why cooling system failure is the number one cause of engine-related roadside breakdowns. Follow these Fall Car Care Tips from AutoZone, and you'll be ready for whatever weather lies ahead. Flush and fill your cooling system. Performing a routine flush and fill is quick and easy, and it's cheap insurance against engine failure. The National Car Care Council recommends doing this every two years or 24,000 miles for most vehicles. Don't assume that simply draining your radiator is enough. To do the job right, you need to flush the system with a radiator flush product, not just plain water, to remove stubborn rust, grease, and sediment. Many motorists make the mistake of judging the condition of their antifreeze by its color. Contaminants like rust, sediment, or oil may cause the antifreeze to change colors, but it's the chemical breakdown over time that renders your antifreeze ineffective against freeze-ups, boil overs and corrosion. And old, weak antifreeze won't provide sufficient engine protection, regardless of the color. So play it safe, and change your antifreeze every two years or 24,000 miles.
