						The cover of the book I read looks different, I've never seen this cover. It's really good, though. Don't judge a book by its cover! This book is a story about Greek mythology. I read this book because in Beta club at school, there is a committee for convention called Battle of the Books. You get a list of books you have to read. This was by far my favorite. This might even be my favorite book ever. It is action-packed and doesn't get boring in any parts like some books do. This was a REALLY good book. Also read the other books in the series.

						 see more 
 
 
						Divergent is a fantastic book by a young author. After reading the Hunger Games books, I was a little nervous about whether Divergent would be a copy-cat attempt at fame. While somewhat similar to the style of The Hunger Games -dystopian theme- the plot is very different. Definitely different enough to make you want to come back for more. I am excited to see where she goes with the books to come.

						I was kind of wary of this book.  Oh, great, another dystopian YA book in which love conquers all and the MC saves the day, even though she is a, GASP, girl! I had been putting off reading it because it seemed like more of THE SAME OLD STUFF.  Oho, was I wrong. 

This was a hard book to review because I don't want to give away too much, but I want to express all the right components that make it awesome.  Less than one chapter in, I was completely enthralled.

						I work as an early childhood educator and always purchase Brown Bear books as gifts for parents in our program to read to their children. This book has a wonderful cadence and rythmn that can be tapped on the board book when read to the child. This is a great way to keep the childs attention while reading the book. It is also exciting when you see the child pick up the book and start tapping and &quot;reading&quot; (as best they can) the book. It also teachers children primary colors and is easily memorized for retelling. I recommend it to everyone with young children - and for gifts.

						After watching the series on HBO, I had to immediately find and read the books for myself and found this great deal on Target.com. I'm not a reader, but I've engrossed myself in these books because the story is so rich and epic. I'm not getting much else done this summer. The price on Target.com was the best I've seen and it arrived quickly.

						Oh goodness. Where to start. This book was certainly not what I expected when I started it, but I was not disappointed. It really got into my head, and made me think a lot in general. The book had me sobbing uncontrollably by the end, and long after I was finished the tears continued. A great read.

						This book hooked me from page one. I was at a friend's house and I saw it on her coffee table, picked it up, read five pages and immediately had to go get my own copy (as she wasn't done reading it yet). I FLEW through this book and would recommend it to anyone (and in fact I already have). It has everything one could want in a story; humor, aching sadness, thrills, love, and a final twist that will leave you flabbergasted for days. READ THIS BOOK! Enjoy :)

						It was good. I love Gideon Cross and I felt for Eva's confussion! Every woman wants a man that will do anything for her but the level of need on both of their parts is beyond any sort of normal behavior! But you want them to make it and you root for them with everything in you as if they are real people and not characters in a book, because Gideon has endearing, loveable qualities, with a wounded soul about him and you wish she would stop running and trust him!

 Great series! 
 
 
						
						The entire series is awes ...

						The entire series is awesome! Be sure to read the Percy Jackson series, then the Heroes of Olympus series. This is the 3rd book in the Heroes of Olympus series. I wish we didn't have to wait a whole year for book 4!

 Great book! Great price? 
 
 
						
						I loved reading his book! ...

						I loved reading his book! I'm not the kind of person who keeps their book copies so they can read them over again, so I was hoping to get this book at the library. Since the library didn't have it, I got a copy from Target. The paperback copy of this book is nice if you don't mind small scratches on the title page. I loved the bok, but I didn't want to pay nine dollars for it when I could borrow it for free from a library.
