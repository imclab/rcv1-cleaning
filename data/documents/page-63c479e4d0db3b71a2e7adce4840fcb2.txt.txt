How does literature affect art? In: Entertainment & Arts , Books and Literature , Age of Enlightenment [ Edit categories ]  Answer: Literature's Affect on Art The FAQ Farmer's have said that both literature and art are and always will be affected by: what time the artist/author lived/lives in, the political world and mostly by the personal experiences that the artist/author has gone through at the time. Art can have influence on literature, and works of art can influence other artists; in some rare cases a book can inspire an artist to make a unique piece of art. Obviously the Bible (if you can treat it as a work of literature) has inspired numerous pictorial representations. Also works of classical literature (by Homer, Ovid) were treated as inspiration by many painters. This was mainly before the 20th century, when art tended to be illustrative. In the case of modern/contemporary art, the direction of influence has been rather from art to literature.  Did we answer your question?
