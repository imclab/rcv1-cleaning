Designed to preview the upcoming CLA / CLC , the concept is a four-door coupe that draws styling cues from the A - and CLS-Class . Official specifications haven't been released, but the concept rides on the MFA platform and reportedly measures 4637mm long, 1891mm wide and 1398mm tall with a wheelbase that spans 2699mm. Power is provided by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder petrol engine with 211 PS (155 kW / 208 hp). However, the production model will likely offer a variety of engines with outputs ranging from 109 PS (80 kW / 108 hp) to 211 PS (155 kW / 208 hp). On a side note, it turns out our suspicions were correct as the terribly mundane design video was indeed a teaser of theConcept Style Coupe.

The bavarian need to watch out coz they are entering the "boring" area with their production and concept cars TBH, and in most cases their designs are reactionary to what they see others do (mb 4-dr coupe? ok let's make a 6er 4dr coupe and so on). Good job Merc..Love the design 0 0 April 19, 2012 7:35 am report abuse | reply 4387 Han Solo Nice...very nice...but the headlights looks a little too similar to one of the Volvos...but still it's nice. 0 0 April 18, 2012 10:47 pm report abuse | reply 11863 August Horch I really want to like this car, but something about the back just doesn't seem right. Hopefully, it'll look better in reality than in pictures. 0 0 April 18, 2012 10:05 pm report abuse | reply 8214 jerry05cod4 this is how the cls should've looked...gorgeous 1 0 April 18, 2012 7:18 pm report abuse | reply 12470 zamzungas Mercedes looks more hyunadaish, or hyundais looks more mercish? I would choose first variant :) 3 0 April 18, 2012 2:48 pm report abuse | reply 1 reply 3419 CDspeed Huyndai is the one doing the copying, the Huyndai is bland compared to this. 0 1 -1 April 18, 2012 5:10 pm report abuse | reply 1384 eddie The Germans have really been stepping up the styling and tech including more aluminum, carbon fiber, clean diesels, plug in diesel hybrids, etc. 0 0 April 18, 2012 1:52 pm report abuse | reply 657 peterjames7 Wow..... I want one! 0 0 April 18, 2012 1:44 pm report abuse | reply 17075 Afrikar Passat CC with the Benz edge to it, eventhough MB started the whole thing with the CLS, will be tight inside especially in the back seat. 0 1 April 18, 2012 1:29 pm report abuse | reply 17838 progressive Very agressive. Not so sure that MB should be like that. This design looks like Huyndai made it. 1 1 April 18, 2012 1:14 pm report abuse | reply 22264 paulbaker It does seem like Mercedes is maintaining a traditional line (C-class, E-class, S-class) and also nurturing a revolutionary line that may eventually become their primary line-up...or else their traditional line eventually catches up with the look of these beauties. 0 0 April 18, 2012 1:13 pm report abuse | reply 1011 Beybaba Finally Mercedes, I was getting worried... 0 0 April 18, 2012 12:33 pm report abuse | reply 840 adz911 The best looking Mercedes in a very very long time! Love it! 1 0 April 18, 2012 11:34 am report abuse | reply 3419 CDspeed I like it, I think it's actually better looking then the current CLS. It kind of reminds me of the first generation CLS. 1 0 April 18, 2012 10:46 am report abuse | reply 21583 BanfSnieder Nice, I was worried that the proportions for a fastback wouldn't work on a small car but they seem to have done a good job. It may be a little off putting from the rear 3/4 view but i'll wait to see it in person. If the back seats are functional I think MB has a winner. 0 0 April 18, 2012 10:42 am report abuse | reply 3782 automobile007 Love it, big improvement on the last concept.Also i don't think this was leaked, these images were sent out to the press yesterday to be released today 0 0 April 18, 2012 10:30 am report abuse | reply 611 dmanero I like the design but I fear that Mercedes is going away from being elegant businessman car and being more on sporty looking. 3 2 April 18, 2012 10:29 am report abuse | reply 3 replies 15620 SnakesInMyPants Thats a good thing.
