Customer Comments San Fransisco Auto Repair "Best Independent Auto Shop In SF. Mark, the owner goes above and beyond in his service for all your automotive needs. I have used him about five times and each time his prices are very reasonable, he is prompt, his repairs are top quality and he is extremely amenable with scheduling. I notice that he has many repeat customers including myself. He has an old world value about his work and it shows. He takes pride in what he is doing and you will be happy with the results. Finally he never sells you anything like other repair shops, he does what is needed and hopes you come back later when you need him again. His philosophy works." "Great shop, great value. Mark quickly helped me in an emergency; A great shop with great service. #1 neighborhood shop in SF and I have been to many of them! ..."
