Students learn how form and content in a work of art interact to yield meaning. Creative expression and effective communication are fostered by a solid foundation of work from observation and perception. Students are encouraged to develop ways of choosing directions, media, and subject matter. Through studio work, group discussion, lectures, seminars, individual consultations with faculty and visiting artists, and frequent trips to museums, galleries, and artists&rsquo; studios, students develop the technical ability, critical awareness, knowledge of historical frameworks, and self-discipline to form a unique, personal vision. A rigorous, structured program prepares students for the challenges of further study at four-year colleges of art and design. The program goals of the Fine Arts major are: To develop students&rsquo; technical skills, historical knowledge, visual vocabulary and critical ability. To foster individual vision, expression, and creativity. To prepare students for further study in fine arts or other areas of art and design. Download Laptop Recommendations for the Fine Arts major.
