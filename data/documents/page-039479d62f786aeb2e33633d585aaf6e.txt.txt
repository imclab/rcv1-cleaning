ABC TV Arts commissions and delivers content to ABC1, ABC2, Arts Online and to mobile platforms. We are looking for content that is innovative and entertaining, challenging and distinctive, culturally diverse, informative and reflective of cultural life in Australia today. We seek to engage with arts across the spectrum Â&ndash; from the mainstream to the avant-garde, on the street and in the concert hall Â&ndash; but excellence in practice is the key focus for our commissioning. Equally, we seek to commission a balanced slate of programming from niche and specialist focussed content to programs with more broad appeal. Across our slate we want to discover and illuminate arts practice and process, artists and creative ideas for our audience. In 2012 we will have a strong focus on contemporary Australian artistic practice.
