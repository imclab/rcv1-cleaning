 Arts and&nbsp;Entertainment 
 
 Arts and Entertainment Editor 
 New Jersey loves the arts!  Write an article providing information about theatre, music, dance, or art in New Jersey, famous people in the arts from New Jersey, and places where arts related events are taking place. 
 You may write one of the following articles. Select a topic that you find interesting and that may not be commonly known to other 4th graders.  In addition to the facts, see if you can&#8217;t find a way to surprise your readers.  Be sure to tell them why this topic is important to New Jersey. 
 
 One article, 150- 250 words, about a famous artist, writer, musician or actor from New Jersey. 
 One article, 150-250 words, about an arts venue that is also an historic site  in New Jersey. 
 One article, 150- 250 words, about what arts and entertainment opportunities are available for kids and their families in New Jersey, where they are and what makes them good for kids. 
 
   
 Use correct grammar, punctuation and capitalization.  Use Times New Roman or Arial size 12 font.  Be sure to save your work and name each document file as instructed by your teacher.  You may cut and paste one photo into your article. 
 Go to the  Student Resources  page to help with your research. 
   
 Here&#8217;s a Fun Class Project:  Create a calendar listing of arts and entertainment events happening in your area of New Jersey during a one month period. Include location, times, ticket prices, and a brief description of the event in your listing.
