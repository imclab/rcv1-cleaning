WELL DONE! i'd buy more from this company eventhough made in thialand - only real negative - USA. 1 Comment | &#160; Was this review helpful to you? Yes No 6 of 7 people found the following review helpful 1.0 out of 5 stars WARNING THIS CONSOLE WARPS! March 23, 2012 By fayfay Color Name: Cottage Oak I purchased this console somewhere else right before Christmas to put my new 42" plasma tv on. It looks nice and is a heavy piece of furniture. Unfortunately, it has started to scratch, warp and buckle already. The only thing on top of it is the tv. I know it cannot be from the weight. Unfortunately, it is too late to take back to the store and the manufacturer says it is our fault because it must not have been level. My husband is not new at putting things together...he has a lot of carpentry experience. It looks like we got a defective one and the manufacturer does not stand behind their product. Comment | &#160; Was this review helpful to you? Yes No 3 of 3 people found the following review helpful 4.0 out of 5 stars Pleased but not without problems. August 27, 2012 By Vincent L. Color Name: Distressed Oak | Amazon Verified Purchase First of all the service from Amazon was great. It was shiped and delivered nearly a week sooner than I expected. As for the TV stand it met my expectations for quality of materials and finish. The color matched the online illustration and my living room furniture almost perfectly. All the visible outside veniers are oak some inside are birch but stained to match the oak. The assembly instructions were easy to follow and the piece went together with relitive ease. The only time I needed an extra hand was to drop the top on. The only tools needed were flat blade and philips screwdrivers. The hardware was of good quslity (all metal, not plastic) and there were no pieces short or missing. In fact several extras of various pieces were provided. The only real problem I had was the hinges on the doors were set too high and they rubbed the top when closed. In fact one door wase bound and would not close. As a quick fix I shimmed up the top to correct the problem but the hinges realy need to be reset 1/8" lower for proper clearance, which I intend to do soon. All in all I am pleased with this product and it looks great with my new 47" flat screen on top. Comment | &#160; Was this review helpful to you? Yes No 2 of 2 people found the following review helpful 3.0 out of 5 stars TV console January 11, 2012 By Suzanne G. Warner Color Name: Cottage Oak | Amazon Verified Purchase Shipping was very quick. I do take issue with the hardware. The screws didn't fit to attach it to the doors. The screw didn't seem long enough, so that was no problem. Purchased another longer screw(s) and it still wouldn't fit. The problem is the threads on the pulls wouldn't allow me to set the screw all the way for it to stay on the doors. I plan to fix this myself, as I feel contacting the company would take too long (my husband is a general contractor and can fix it himself). The look and finish of the wood is good. Comment | &#160; Was this review helpful to you? Yes No 2 of 2 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars BE AWARE! December 11, 2011 By reuty Color Name: Cottage Oak | Amazon Verified Purchase Overall we are very satisfied with the finished product, it looks wonderful in our great room. Assembling was fairly resonable except it was missing steps 3 and 4. Obviously they weren't required steps to assemble the stand because we got through it fine. My hubby who is very particular about furniture was very happy with the end result. HOWEVER, BE AWARE OF THE COLOR IN AD. If you're looking for a nice light maple or light oak type finish this is not for you!!! The color is a rich, darker oak finish almost cherry bu very attractive and rich looking. VERY HAPPY! 2 Comments | &#160; Was this review helpful to you? Yes No 1 of 1 people found the following review helpful 3.0 out of 5 stars Quite a task, worth the effort. January 28, 2013 By Consumer1 Color Name: Distressed Oak | Amazon Verified Purchase Fast shipping, 2 boxes arrived in pretty good shape. The wood & finish gets an &#34;A-&#34;, Overall fit gets a &#34;B&#34; as I had to drill new holes for the door hinges to lower the doors 1/8th in. as they would rub at the top. The hardware supplied and the fastening method is beneath the quality of the wood. They use cam & screw. If you ever assembled a cheap particle board piece, you know what I mean. This a heavy piece of furniture, I don't believe the eight screws supplied would ever keep this top on. I recommend using carpenters glue & I installed &#34;L&#34; brackets with screws. Knowing all this, I would still buy it again, a beautiful piece of furniture. I enjoy a challenge. I recommend at least two handy people for this project.

It took me longer than most (I assume) to put it together but I did it by myself. I am a 78 year old woman! It now occupies a place in my living room and is very satisfactory. 1 Comment | &#160; Was this review helpful to you?
