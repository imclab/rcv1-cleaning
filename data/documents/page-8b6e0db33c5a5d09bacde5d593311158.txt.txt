   An Online Library of Literature Read. Learn. Think. Welcome to literature.org . This site is here to try to bring real books to people through the Internet. On this site you will find the full and unabridged texts of classic works of English literature. Fiction from authors like Lewis Carroll , the Bronte sisters ( Anne , Charlotte and Emily ), Jack London , Mark Twain , Charles Dickens and many others, and classic scientific works from Charles Darwin and Rene Descartes . More books will be added soon, however as this site is maintained by enthusiasts rather than professional librarians this may be a very slow process. Our sponsor, the people behind the knowledge.com&trade; directory, is currently working on new technology that will make this updating easier and quicker in the near future. Please let us know what you think, and what new books you want added. For those who may not be familiar with Copyright law, we are unable to make works available that are not in the public domain . This mean, basically, nothing where the author has not been dead for at least 75 to 90 years.
