Pin It Tweet Arts & Entertainment Tuesday December 25, 2012 SiblingsÃ¢&euro;&trade; comic an outlet for oddball humor &#39;The Flying McCoys&#39; makes debut this week Brothers Glenn and Gary McCoy each draw for "The Flying McCoys" with a style so similar that it&#39;s difficult to determine who produced the day&#39;s panel. by Zack Harold Daily Mail staff Charleston Daily Mail Courtesy photo The Brothers McCoy, Gary, left and Glenn, are the creators of "The Flying McCoys," a new cartoon panel that debuted in the Daily Mail this week. Advertiser CHARLESTON, W.Va. - Brothers Glenn and Gary McCoy have been drawing together since they were four and seven years old, respectively. And it shows. They&#39;re the brothers behind &quot;The Flying McCoys,&quot; which has made its Daily Mail debut this week. Their panel, which is in the upper right corner of the comics page, replaces &quot;Herman,&quot; which was in reruns after creator Jim Unger died last spring. The McCoy brothers never work on the same drawing. Still, it&#39;s difficult to tell which McCoy produced each day&#39;s comic. All the characters have the same giant, bulbous noses, and the jokes are all a little twisted. A recent cartoon from Glenn features Hermey the Elf from the classic &quot;Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer&quot; Christmas special telling Rudolph, &quot;Now you can&#39;t play any reindeer games because we&#39;re all worried you&#39;ll break your nose and leak mercury everywhere.&quot; A recent cartoon from Gary shows a white-haired mother opening her front door to a man in a dirty orange jumpsuit, carrying a shovel. &quot;Son,&quot; the woman said. &quot;You made it home for the holidays!&quot; &quot;It&#39;s funny, our writing is so simpatico,&quot; Glenn said. &quot;I guess we shared such common interest in Chuck Jones cartoons and Mad Magazine and Charlie Brown, we mesh well. I chalk it up to being so close as brothers. I really feel like I know what he&#39;s thinking.&quot; There have been numerous occasions where the brothers have written the same joke. &quot;It&#39;s always an uncomfortable phone call. &#39;Hey man, I beat you to this three years ago,&#39; &quot; he said. Though Gary has been drawing longer, it was actually Glenn who first became a professional cartoonist. He stuck with cartooning through high school and college and began making a living with his drawings. Gary felt he needed to seek out a more traditional line of work. He worked as a bar bouncer, a computer operator, a furniture mover and, for a while, a graphic artist at a newspaper. &quot;When it comes to finding a job, it seems more of a pipe dream. You don&#39;t walk down the street and see a lot of signs, &#39;Cartoonist needed,&#39; &quot; Glenn said. But when Gary saw his brother&#39;s budding career, he decided to start drawing again. He soon began selling those cartoons to publications like Parade and Playboy magazine, and developed a comic strip for King Features called &quot;That&#39;s My Dad.&quot; Glenn, who also was doing work for Playboy and Parade along with editorial cartoons and greeting cards, had his own strip with rival syndicate Universal Press called &quot;The Duplex,&quot; which debuted in 1993. The brothers launched &quot;The Flying McCoys,&quot; their first joint venture, in 2005. &quot;It seemed a no-brainer that, since we&#39;d been doing this together since we were kids, to try and make a go of it,&quot; Glenn said.

Glenn had big ideas when he and Gary started their joint cartoon, imagining the brothers would punch the clock together and work side-by-side in the same studio. He even reorganized his home studio space to install an extra drawing board and computer. Baby brother&#39;s hopes were dashed, however, when he realized Gary is usually getting out of bed around the time he breaks for lunch. &quot;I joke, it&#39;s like having a brother in Europe,&quot; he said. Glenn has to wait until 4 p.m. to phone Gary about work. Their houses are only a few miles apart, but they live in completely different biological time zones. They do work together, however. Glenn said he and Gary talk every day to bounce ideas around and ask each other&#39;s advice. &quot;We show each other the cartoons after we&#39;re done and laugh at them,&quot; Glenn said. &quot;When we do our cartoons we&#39;re not trying to fill any niche. We&#39;re really just drawing what makes us laugh.&quot; Sometimes the jokes are based on things that happen to the brothers in real life. Glenn carries a notepad around, so he&#39;s always ready when inspiration strikes. He keeps a notepad on his nightstand, too, in case the muses decide to wake him up. Sometimes, he just begins doodling and ideas &quot;sprout out.&quot; Gary&#39;s writing process sounds as unconventional as his sleep schedule and office hours. &quot;He said &#39;I&#39;ve found if I sit and I&#39;ll laugh out loud, then I&#39;ll backtrack and try to think of something that would make me laugh.&#39; That&#39;s the most messed up writing style I&#39;ve ever heard of,&quot; Glenn said. But it works. The National Cartoonists Society gave &quot;The Flying McCoys&quot; the award for &quot;Best Newspaper Panel Cartoon&quot; in 2011. Glenn said he and Gary also get many letters from fans, plus a lot of support on Facebook. &quot;It&#39;s gratifying. I feel really lucky,&quot; he said. &quot;(&#39;Peanuts&#39; creator Charles) Shultz had a quote - Gary told me about this - Shultz told him, he doesn&#39;t like to refer to what he does as work. He feels so lucky, he doesn&#39;t want to bring bad luck down on him. &quot;It definitely beats digging a ditch.&quot; And, coming from a man who works alongside a bar bouncer-turned-black humor cartoonist, we&#39;d better believe him.
