She told the crowd, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what your perception is of Jessica Simpson or what tabloid you buy, but I just want you to know that I&#8217;m just a girl from Texas. I&#8217;m just like you. I&#8217;m doing what I love and dating a boy.&#8221; Yeah, yeah, we know. You can&#8217;t be without a boy for two seconds.. Simpson dedicated &#8220;You&#8217;re My Sunday&#8221; to her &#8216;boy&#8217; Tony Romo, who was there, and sang a ton of covers, such as Willie Nelson &#8216;s &#8220;On the Road Again.&#8221; One guy told the local paper, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to drink a lot of beer to sit through her concert.&#8221; Her new album drops September 9th.
