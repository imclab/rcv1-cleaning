Beyonce Releases Proof She Was Really Pregnant: “Life Is But A Dream” [Video] Meek Mill Talks Charging Fans $100+ For Pics And Why He Doesn’t Care About Rick Ross’s Lyrics 09-04-13 Posted by Peachkyss | Filed Under: Gossip   It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Rick Ross, and rightfully so. Many have been very vocal about their disgust over his lyrics in the remix to the Rocko song “U.O.E.N.O” (“Put molly all in her champagne, she ain’t even know it / I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain’t even know it”). As a result of those lines and his clear confusion about why it’s wrong (saying you would never say the word rape in a song and implying it just because you think you sound witty makes no sense) has led to a lot of uproar and calls for Ross to lose his endorsements with Reebok. Now people in his camp are having to answer for their boss’s lyrics, including Meek Mill, who had a radio interview in DC with 93.9 where he talked about that controversy, along with the heat he has been getting on his own for allegedly charging fans at his shows to be able take pictures with him. His answers were interesting to say the least, and can be kind of difficult to read…good luck. Necole Bitchie got word from numerous people , fans of the rapper, who were pissed about him asking them to pay more than $100 for a chance to cheese it up with him in pictures. When asked about the rumors that he was doing this, he says it wasn’t him, but his people (“homies”) who were making folks pay to take a pic with him. But with R&amp;B divas like Beyoncé and others charging hundreds of dollars for meet and greets, he doesn’t see the problem at all: “Actually, I was not charging to take pictures ya know? My homies be in the crowd and if my homie trying to make some money and you trying to get backstage, he might charge you. That’s your fault. I don’t even see nothing actually wrong. Beyoncé and Rihanna, they charge $500 for a meet and greet. I’m bout to do a meet and greet right now free. I been doing this for years, you know what I’m saying? I take pictures everyday. I just took 20 pictures. I hang in the neighborhood, you know what I’m saying. I hang in the hood. So you know it’s average to me. I come outside everyday, pictures is average to me.” And as for Rick Ross, does he understand why people are up in arms over his lyrics? He didn’t really say yes or no, but rather that he doesn’t care, especially when so many other rappers have said far worse over the years: “You know man, I don’t even care about nobody criticizing no lyrics man. People rap about killing stuff all day man. Biggie said ‘rape your kid, throw her over the bridge,’ back then and it was nothing, it was just hip-hop. Now you got all these weirdos on these social sites voicing their opinions about something anybody say. I don’t care; you know what I’m saying? I’m from the hood. I never really cared about what nobody said in no raps. Raps always been talking about killing, drugs, all types of stuff, you know what I’m saying? So you can’t just criticize no one thing nobody say man. It’s imaginary visuals. If a writer write about somebody getting raped in a movie, is he a rapist or he want girls to get raped? No, he just wrote about that in a movie.” The radio host and Mill went on to explain how they felt Eminem said such things and worse in his raps in the past, and nobody said anything negative about it, so why trip now? But that’s definitely not true, seeing as women’s rights groups and LGBT groups disapproved publicly about Eminem’s lyrics for many years, so where they got the idea that he was getting off scot-free, I’m not sure. But anywho, that’s his opinion. So what do YOU think about his thoughts on the controversy, folks?
