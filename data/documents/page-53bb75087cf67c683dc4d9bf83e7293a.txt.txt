She is a gifted, beloved American actress whose unusual look was anything but a surefire formula for superstardom, although stranger things have happened. It was both her onstage and onscreen work that made her nothing short of an icon in the 1980&#8242;s in films like The Color Purple and Ghost , and that have helped keep her a relevant force in today&#8217;s pop cultural ephemera as moderator on The View (as well as in commercials, on Broadway, and in film and television). Granted, a lot of people love Whoopi Goldberg. And what&#8217;s not to love? She&#8217;s outspoken and unique, embraces her own peculiarity, and when she gets mad on TV, we like to watch. She&#8217;s a riot and a genius, and she has no problem appearing as the face of vaginal diapers (or whatever Poise is). Most importantly, however, she makes a great subject for fan art. Not many people look like Whoopi Goldberg, so why shouldn&#8217;t we bring you nine awesomely weird pieces of fan art dedicated to the Oscar-winning adult diaper shiller? 9. (Source) 8. (Source) 7.
