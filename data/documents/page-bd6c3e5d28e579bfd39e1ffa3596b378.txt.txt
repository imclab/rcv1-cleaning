Her family later moved to Laguna Beach. Lauren has always been considered the Â&ldquo;nice girlÂ&rdquo; out of all her friends and was voted Â&ldquo;Most IrresistibleÂ&rdquo; by her senior classmates at Laguna Beach High School. During her high school years she also served on the Â&ldquo;Student Body Governing CouncilÂ&rdquo; similar so what is known as student council at most schools. In her free time she enjoys shopping, eating out, going to the beach, being with friends and fashion design. Lauren was the main character in season one of Laguna Beach. Her Â&ldquo;careerÂ&rdquo; started when MTV came to Laguna Beach High School and chose to cast her and her group of friends to be the stars of the new reality show Â&ldquo;Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County.Â&rdquo; Her life with her friends and at home were documented by the MTV cameras and ended up aiding in the breakthrough of a hit show for MTV. Lauren was the narrator of the first season of Laguna Beach and became an idol to many girls across the US.

During this season Lauren received an internship in Los Angeles, California at Three Dots clothing company.

Lauren Conrad was photographed leaving lunch at The Grill in Beverly Hills on June 24, and the former reality TV star did her best to shield her face from the photogs while rocking her ombre locks (which even seem to have a hint of pink on the ends). For her lunchtime outfit, Lauren started with a white top (like Bailey 44's Reaction Time Top in White ) tucked into a blue mid-calf skirt (TYSA's Flutter Skirt in Sky is very similar), and then wore a pair of tortoise Wayfarers and toted an ivory shoulder bag. A pair of tan strappy wedges (for two similar options, check out either Dolce Vita's Jury Wedges in Nude or Bed Stu's Julie Platform in Nectar ) added the perfect finishing touch to Lauren's casual street style ensemble. What are your thoughts on LC's look here, friends? In other Lauren news, the blonde starlet recently wrote on her official website about her beauty travel tips, saying: " When IÂ&rsquo;m hopping on a different plane every day, the first place I see it take a toll is on my skin. Between disrupted sleep patterns and stale airplane air, my skin can go from great to bad in a matter of hours. Throughout my years of book tours and cross-country business trips, I have found that itÂ&rsquo;s nearly impossible to maintain a consistent beauty and skincare routine when traveling. Luckily, there are a few products and tips I rely on that truly save my skin. " Lauren then went on to discuss specific products, which you can head over to LaurenConrad.com to read all about. What about you, do you have any top travel and beauty tips you wish to share?

From there, Lauren opted for a pair of leather leggings (like Joe's Jeans' Leather Pant in Black ) with a pair of classic black pumps, and accessorized with a black Balenciaga tote (get the look for less with Zambos & Siega's Dae Bag in Black ) and a pair of shades (for a sleek aviator style, check out Ray-Ban's Cockpit Sunglasses in Gunmetal ). What are your thoughts on LC's festive look, friends? In other Lauren news, the modern day style icon recently chatted with Stylecaster about who her style icons are, saying: " ThereÂ&rsquo;s not one person that I say I want to look like. When weÂ&rsquo;re pulling up photos for inspiration, we tend to pull photos from years and years ago. WeÂ&rsquo;re more likely to pull a photo of Audrey Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot as opposed to something off a website from today. " When asked what one of her recent splurges was, Lauren replied: " My mom was a great bargain hunter, which I love because it kind of taught me how to dress high and low. I love wearing designer pieces with something I found at Target. But I recently splurged on a Goyard leather carry on. You donÂ&rsquo;t have to check it, and you can wear it at the airport with a T-shirt and jeans and it still looks great because it pulls the whole outfit together! " Very cute!

Sounds like she thinks that Mr. Tell is the one!

Lauren Conrad was photographed attending the 2012 Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic which was held at Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades, CA on October 6, looking pretty and polished as always.

Accessory wise, Lauren kept it pretty simple, only wearing a gold double finger ring (like Erica Anenberg's Cosmo Sparkle Twosome in Gold/Clear ) and her trademark winged eye liner. Are you liking this sweet look for LC, or is it a bit too familiar to outfits that she has sported in the past? In other Lauren news, the former "Hills" darling recently spoke to People about her latest crafty ways. According to Conrad: " I make scarves for everybody, it's like a new addiction of mine. All I know how to do is make a scarf, but I really enjoy knitting so I can't like give those things away. I keep making people wear them and nobody even really wants them anymore! I'm [also very] excited for the weather to change so I can finally wear some of it, because I've gotten some really great boots. ItÂ&rsquo;s all about texture this season, so whether itÂ&rsquo;s the big chunky knits or the mixing in of leather pieces. " Chunky knits and leather? That doesn't just sound like what's in for this fall season, but for every fall season!

Pairing black skinny jeans (try James Jeans' 5 Pocket Legging in Dark Paris ) with an army green silk button down (try Joie's Pearline in Smokey Topaz , or for a printed option, check out Free People's Floral Button Down in Navy Combo ), Lauren then slipped into a pair of black strappy wedges and carried two bags, one Balenciaga and one Chanel.

What are your thoughts on this look for Miss Conrad? In other Lauren news, a source close to the former "Hills" starlet is speaking out about how she is in a "really good place." According to the Conrad confidante, " Lauren is in a really good place. She has created a mini-empire, with bestselling books and a blog on fashion. The last season of the show she earned almost $6 million and was very wise with her money. She's purchased a home in Los Angeles, where she lives with her dog, Chloe, and looks prettier than ever.

A pair of oversized sunglasses and one of Lauren's trusty Balenciaga handbags (for a similar tote at a fraction of the price, try Zambos & Siega's Dae Bag in Black ) provided accessory details to Lauren's look.

For her outfit, Lauren slipped into an Isabel Marant Spring 2012 tie dye dress (for two options with a similar dye, check out Michelle Jonas Travelwear's Sandy Chiffon Wrap Dress in Persimmon and Gypsy 05's Cherry Top ), and then accessorized with an oversized Chloe tote (the silhouette of Linea Pelle Collection's Willow Shoulder Bag in Whiskey is similar), black sunglasses, and DV by Dolce Vita sandals (check out Dolce Vita's similar Banks Shoes in Black ). Are you into Lauren's look here, everyone? I think that tie dye is a great print for summer, especially when paired with polished accessories. CelebStyle recently chatted with Lauren on her latest style ideas, and the former "Hills" star dished: " like balancing out different qualities, whether it's a really feminine top paired with leather pants or a button-down in a more masculine, traditional shape with a full skirt. " When it comes to accessories, Lauren said: " I always try to find pieces I can work around, so I always have a basic black shoe, I always have a basic nude shoe, a black bag, and clothing-wise, I always have some sort of black skinny pants whether it's leather or a denim or some sort of knit. I always have a blazer depending on the season, and I wear a lot of maxi dresses. " Classic and chic as always!

What is your take on this look for Lauren, readers? The fashionista recently dished on what inspires her multiple clothing lines, and said: " My inspirations are translated in different ways throughout the process. I tried to make it similar to my personal style. I like dressing really comfortably, but I grew up at the beach in looser, flowing fabrics. Now that I live in the city I have to dress up more, so I tried to combine the two styles. You can dress it up, dress it down. I made it very simple and clean because I like to accessorize. ItÂ&rsquo;s very diverse to wear. " Very interesting to hear her take on what she's designing!

However, this girl is just the complete opposite. She loves being famous. ThatÂ&rsquo;s all she ever wanted, and she does all the shameless things that people do. It was fun to play that character. I know so many people like that! " Sounds like it could be based on a lot of people Lauren knows!

Do you think this look could have benefited from a dainty necklace, such as Satya Jewelry's Silver Bless Your Heart Necklace in Turquoise ? Overall, this look is classic Lauren - girly and effortless. Now that she's on her book tour, Lauren has been doing tons of interviews to promote "The Fame Game." When speaking to The Charlotte Observer about how she deals when people say that it probably wasn't her who actually wrote the book (and instead a ghost writer), Lauren said: " You have to take it as it comes. I take it as a compliment. When they tell you they didn't think you could do it, you prove you can. ... I really wanted to get younger girls to read. I remember never wanting to read growing up, but there were a few (books) that I could really get lost in. If you can ever get a young person to pick up a book and read it, that's great.

Photographed leaving Katsuya in Hollywood on January 10, Lauren Conrad seemed to be a bit shy and tried shielding her face from the ever-present paparazzi. I always find it funny when celebs act like they don't want to get their picture taken when they're leaving Katsuya, especially when paparazzi pretty much camp out in front of the restaurant! You don't want your photo taken? There's about 1,000 other sushi restaurants in LA that the paparazzi don't frequent. Just a tip!

But she seemed giddy when he approached her table around midnight, giving him a huge hug hello and touching his face with her hands. Though they were friendly throughout the evening, it didn't appear like they were rekindling anything romantically. " That's nice that there was no awkwardness between the two! Buy the Look Rotate Porkchop Crop in Bleulead Wash Pocket Tank Wide Stripe Wrap in Heather Grey Lauren Conrad seen on Jan 05 2012 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was snapped heading to the Kate Somerville Spa in West Hollywood on January 5, giving the paparazzi a friendly wave before indulging in a few beauty treatments.

Lauren recently divulged her New Year's Resolutions on her blog, and they included: sending more thank you notes, making an effort to plan a dinner with my friends once a week, and organizing my closet once a month. Those sound good to me, especially writing more thank you notes. Manners are so important! How does LC plan to make sure she sticks to these resolutions? Well, she said: " I made sure my resolutions are things that can be measured or checked off. They are all realistic and definitely attainable. I did this because whenever I make vague resolutions like, Â&ldquo;Take more chances!Â&rdquo; they end up being grandiose statements, which I never follow through with. " She continued: " I am going to re-read them once a month by setting a reminder on my phone. I donÂ&rsquo;t know if this is the best idea. It will probably get annoying. At least this way I wonÂ&rsquo;t be able to escape them until theyÂ&rsquo;ve been accomplished ." Ha! Let's hope she sticks with them. Buy the Look Turquoise Slice Necklace 28 Inch Finley Jacket in Black/White Mamba Leggera Faux Leather Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 08 2011 in Los Angeles, CA. Making an appearance at the launch of the video game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim that was held at the Belasco Theatre in LA on November 8, Lauren Conrad opted for a cute and sophisticated outfit for her night out. Sporting a pair of faux leather leggings from her line Paper Crown (for another option, try Work Custom Jeans' Mamba Leggera Faux Leather Leggings in Neo Black ) with a silky top (try Boulee's Michelle Open Back Top in White ) and a white blazer (check out Joie's Finley Jacket in Black/White ), Lauren polished things off with a simple pair of black pumps, a long pendant necklace (get the look with Tiger Lily Jewelry's Turquoise Slice Necklace in 28 Inch ) and an oversized grey leather clutch. Is this look on Lauren a winner in your eyes, everyone? Lauren has been enjoying the single life quite a bit recently, as it has been reported that now that things have cooled down with Derek Hough, Lauren has been spotted with Chace Crawford! According to spies inside LA's Voyeur Nightclub, the former "Hills" cutie and "Gossip" guy were "making out" and later "hooked up" at mutual pal Shawn Pyfrom's house. While neither Lauren or Chace's reps will confirm whether or not this is true or not, I think that these two would definitely make a cute couple. What about you? Can you see LC and CC coupled up? Buy the Look Callie in Red Cobra Nile Expandable Wire Bangle Set of 7 Tank Dress Sequin Dress Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 26 2011 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad attended the 2nd Annual Autumn Party featuring a fashion show by Yigal Azrouel benefiting the Children's Institute that was held at The London Hotel in West Hollywood on October 26, and looked sweet and shimmery as she smiled on the red carpet. In a champagne colored sequined dress (for two similar options, check out Halston Heritage's Tank Dress in Golden or Mark & James by Badgley Mischka's Sequin Dress in Cream ) with a pair of nude peep toe pumps, Lauren toted an oversized nude clutch which, in my opinion, is too large to carry on the red carpet and - let's get real - kind of looks like a paper bag. For a more vibrant option, go for a pop of color with Julie K Handbags' Callie in Red Cobra . Finally, Lauren stacked on a few golden bangles (try Alex and Ani's Set of 7 Expandable Wire Bangles w/ Ribbed in Gold ) and went for a bright pink lip and pinned up waves.

Lauren Conrad was photographed making a variety of facial expressions after a night out at popular Hollywood destination Beacher's Madhouse on September 28, opting for a classic LC ensemble for her night out. After slipping into a trademark pair of black leather leggings (go faux with Yoana Baraschi's Faux Leather and Knit Legging in Black ), Lauren wore a ladylike navy silk blouse (similar to Boulee's Dillan Top in Navy ) and a pair of strappy black platforms (check out Diane von Furstenburg's Zia Sandal in Black ). On the accessory front, one of her trusty Chanel handbags and a simple silver bangle (like Elizabeth & James' Wide Studded Bangle in Sterling Silver ) completed Lauren's look.

While it's unsurprisingly simple, a classic, chic look is definitely what Lauren does best. The former reality star recently spoke to Elle about the new line, saying: " The story of Paper Crown came from when I used to visit my grandmother. We would always want to play dress up, but she didnÂ&rsquo;t have my dress up trunk there. So, we would cut things out of paper and make crowns and that was our own way of dressing up. With Paper Crown, our palette is always going to be much softer and more romantic then most of the other colors out there. You want to incorporate new trends, but still stay true to the brand youÂ&rsquo;ve created. " Let's hope she steps out of the box just a tad more than she has on her other collections, though!

They key to showing off one body part in a major way (i.e. legs) is to keep the rest of your body covered, which Lauren does here. Fashionistas, take note! When getting ready for her night out, Lauren must have kept the old adage "if you've got it, flaunt it!" in mind. She paired a sheer striped blouse (for something similar, try either Central Park West's Metro Striped Top in Black/Cream or Splendid's Sheer Stripe Tee in White ) with a pair of micro shorts (like Bleulab's Shortcut Cutoff Shorts in Hydron Black ) and black ankle strap pumps (very similar to L.A.M.B.'s Pounce Pony Hair Ankle Strap Pump in Black ). On a beauty note, Lauren opted for ruby red lips and her trademark California girl waves. What are your thoughts on this outfit, everyone? After recently launching her newest fashion line Paper Crown, Lauren seems to be as busy as ever. She recently dished about her latest projects, and said: " IÂ&rsquo;m still writing, and designing. Honestly IÂ&rsquo;m pretty content right now. I have a series that I have to write, hopefully each fashion line will progress and grow, so I have more to come. At this moment IÂ&rsquo;m really happy with everything thatÂ&rsquo;s on my plate. IÂ&rsquo;m able to have a personal life and work and balance it all. " Sounds like she's in a really good place!

On a beauty note, Lauren glammed up with a bright red lip and a matching manicure and pedicure. Thoughts on Lauren's concert ensemble, everyone? While Lauren is newly single, she is sharing her thoughts on dating and guys with her fans by offering a few pearls of wisdom. Says Lauren, " I make fun of guys when I like them. I act like IÂ&rsquo;m 10 years old. I do it as a test to see if they can laugh at themselves. If they get sensitive, then itÂ&rsquo;s like, Um, this isnÂ&rsquo;t going to work. " Ha! I wonder what one of her tests is? Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 19 2011 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad stepped out for the HTC Status Social launch event that was held at Paramount Studios in LA on July 19, before heading over to the Rebecca Minkoff Shop In Shop event that same evening.

Thoughts, friends? In other Lauren news, the former "Hills" beauty is talking to Teen Vogue about how her style has evolved over the years. She says: " In the past five years I have developed my own personal style. Dressing myself has become less of a chore and more of something I can enjoy. Through trial and error, I learned what worked for me and what didn't. Now I tend to gravitate towards the more classic, feminine looks. I enjoy slipping into a platform to run errands, or throwing my hair into a polished up-do to head to my office. I have fun with it. " She also added: " During my time at Teen Vogue, I learned about trend forecasting. We would shoot editorials three months before they would appear in the magazine. We would have swimwear in the closet in the winter. It always felt so odd, but it taught me to try and stay ahead of trends. This is important when you are designing pieces that won't hit stores for another six months. " Very true! Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 04 2011 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was photographed running a few errands with a friend in West Hollywood on March 4, doing her best to dodge the pesky paps and head into her car. Starting with a great pair of light wash flare jeans (for a similar pair, check out Work Custom Jeans' Marmont Flare in Zuma ; Rich & Skinny's High Rise Flare in Outback are great too), Lauren opted for a classic silk blouse in a pretty coral color (Joe's Jeans' Sheer Top in Nairobi has a similar silhouette in a striking pattern, while Joie's Lamont Blouse in Multi has a pretty hint of coral) along with her trademark Chanel tote. A double finger ring and a sleek blowout completed Lauren's look. Are you into this outfit, readers - and if so, would you wear this while running errands with a friend? As you've heard, while Lauren's MTV reality show is a no-go (however, she has hinted that other networks are interested in picking it up), the former "Hills" star is moving along smoothly with her new clothing line. After appearing at fashion trade show Coterie last month, Lauren offered up a little more info about her new line. Says LC: " I know how important branding is, so it feels very cohesive, and very much like me. My favorites are this tiered maxi dress and cropped leather jacket. It's a very romantic dress, but the jacket toughens it up a bit. Nothing is overly trendy. We want these pieces to be in people's closets for a long, long time. " I'm excited to see the final product! Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 12 2011 in Las Vegas, NV.

We all worked really hard on it and I'm really proud of it. It turned out fantastic, so stay tuned.

Newly brunette beauty Lauren Conrad was photographed leaving the Chris McMillan Salon in Beverly Hills on January 26, and seemed to be in a good mood as the paps snapped away.

Says Kristin: " It was just time to go for it. We've done so many variations of blonde in the past, and it's fun to do something new.

Lauren Conrad made an appearance at Covergirl Cosmetic's 50th Anniversary Celebration that was held on January 5 in West Hollywood, debuting her new darker 'do.

For her ensemble, Lauren chose a simple cream colored dress (try one of Luc by Lucy's flirty minis, like the Beaded Tunic Dress in Off-Gold or the One Shoulder Love Dress in Pale Pink ) that she paired with a few dazzling bangles (try Anna Beck's Timor Skinny Bangles in Silver ) and then finished everything off with Jimmy Choo's Ember heels. For something similar, try Loeffler Randall's Mabel Strappy Platform in Papaya . What are your thoughts of Lauren's look - as well as her darker locks - everyone? Do you like her slightly more mature 'do, or do you prefer her beachy blonde waves? In other Lauren news, she's speaking out about the progress of her new clothing line, saying: " ItÂ&rsquo;s doing really well. ItÂ&rsquo;s a lot of masculine and feminine put together. We did some really great woven kind of suitings. My favorite piece is a tiered chiffon maxi. ItÂ&rsquo;s just so romantic and I love it. " She continues, " I pay a lot more attention to fit. ItÂ&rsquo;s become more important, especially as IÂ&rsquo;ve learned about the process, like how off-the-rack clothing isnÂ&rsquo;t meant to fit every body, and how itÂ&rsquo;s so important to take your things to a tailor and have little things altered ." Are any of you excited to check out the new collection? Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 15 2010 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was seen supporting a good cause at a children's benefit called "Let's Celebrate," supporting the Starlight ChildrenÂ&rsquo;s Foundation and sponsored by Disney on Ice and AEG, held at L.A. LIVE's ice skating rink in LA on December 15. For her ice skating ensemble, Lauren started with a festive sweater (get the look with Ella Moss' Nikita Sparkle Sweater in Black , or opt for a fun, winter floral pattern with Chaser's Boatneck Sweater in Floral Print ) that she paired with classic black leggings (like C&C; California's Full Length Legging in Black ) and a simple bangle on her right wrist.

For the finishing touches to her look, Lauren toted one of her many Chanel bags (while there is no substitute for Chanel, take a peek at Julie K Handbags' tres chic Renee Flap Shoulder Bag in Black ). Since we've seen so much of Lauren in "dressed up book tour" mode lately, what are your thoughts about her laid back style here, readers? In a recent interview about her style, Lauren dished about what her favorite first date outfit is. She said, " I think it depends on where you're going. My dates are more casual now that my boyfriend's done wooing me. So, I'm more of a jeans and sweater girl now. For first dates I think that you want to put in the effort but you don't want to look like you're trying too hard. So. I think it's nice to mix high and low. So if you're wearing a nice bottom, wear a casual top or vice versa. If you're wearing a nicer dress, maybe throw an oversize blazer or a cardigan over it. So you still look relaxed, but nice. " Do you agree with her thoughts? PS - Thanks to all who have weighed in on the new site design, your feedback is so important to us!

For her outfit, Lauren picked an embellished navy mini dress (for a similar option, check out Walter's Cotton Ottoman Dress in Navy/Black , or opt for something a bit edgier like Kill City's Holy Roller Dress in Heather ) that she paired with black platforms (for a classic black pump without the platform, go with Coye Nokes' Jacqueline Pump in Black Crocco ), a Chanel bag and a delicate bracelet (I love Ettika's Gold and Turquoise Wrap Bracelet ). Are you a fan of Lauren's look here, readers? In a recent interview, Lauren spoke out about whether or not she has any guilty fashion pleasures, and said: " I do love my shoes and bags, but I do tend to sway towards more classic investment pieces, so its not like I buy them every day. I'd probably say Urban Outfitters tees, because I'm buying them every week. They're always a little cooler there. I'm trying to update my gym wardrobe. Most of my off days I'm in gym clothes. " When asked about what the most expensive piece of clothing she's ever purchased, Lauren said: " I bought a Cavalli gown. That was very expensive. It was funny because I bought it in Vegas. I was so excited I refused to pack it in my checked luggage. So I carried it on the plane. I got to LAX and I looked down and realized I had left it in the restaurant. And I was like, you gotta be kidding me. I freaked out, and we were calling the security of the airport for two days. And they ended up finding it. Someone's got very good karma for turning it in. I wore it to either a premiere or finale of The Hills that we did on the beach. It was cream and had a large orange-colored flower on the side. Floor length. It was simple, but I liked it. " Do any of you remember this dress? Here's a picture of it to refresh your memory! Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 08 2010 in Los Angeles, CA.

Lauren spoke to Us Weekly about everything, and said: " Right now it's like music samples and picking lights. We start in about a week. I'm excited. It's smaller this time, which is really great and most of the people I'm working with are most of my favorite people. " Divulging just a little bit more info, she continued: " It's going to focus on a clothing line I'm doing with two of my best friends, but it's also going to show all the other things that I do as well as the lifestyle. This [show] is the other side. While we were filming, there was so much of our lives that we weren't allowed to show, and this is basically the rest. " Very interesting! Are you curious to see the format of the new show? Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 05 2010 in New York, NY.

For your ensemble's finishing touch, keep the jewelry to a minimum with Jacquie Aiche's 14k Gold Twisted Waif Set , which can be stacked or worn alone. What are your thoughts on Lauren's look for her book signing, readers... is this a little too bridal for you or are you loving it? If you're a fan of Conrad's, I'm sure you know that she has confirmed her new reality show on MTV. According to MTV.com, " Among the 24-year-old fashion maven's friends featured in the new program are Maura, her roommate, and Gary, who fans might remember from his time on MTV's short-lived reality series "Styl'D." Expect Gary and Maura to play integral roles on the new show, which is still in its early stages. " Will any of her former "Hills" cast mates join her on the show? Lauren says, " I don't know [what will happen], 'cause we haven't started filming yet. So stay tuned! But my roommate and one of my best friends is running the company, the business end, and another one of my good friends, Gary, is doing kind of the creative direction. " Lauren continues: " I'm excited, because I get to work with some of my old crew, which is really cool. I haven't gotten to see them in a while because they're all very busy people, but hopefully I'm going to get some familiar faces. " Who's going to be tuning in? Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 31 2010 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was photographed heading into Hollywood hotspot MyStudio on August 31, following a dinner at Loteria Grill with a few girlfriends. Lauren showed up to MyStudio to support a friend, as she tweeted earlier both about her plans and her super-tall hairdo. She tweeted: " Girl's night out with @jillyHendrix at My Studio tonight!! Come early to hear her DJ! " That tweet was followed by " Higher the hair, closer to god... Tonight I'm feeling like saint haha. " Oh, Lauren! For her clubgoing outfit, Lauren paired a simple strapless dress (like Luc by Lucy's Tube Top Tracey Dress in Pale Pink ) under a cropped black leather motorcycle jacket (similar to BB Dakota's Washed Leather Moto Jacket in Black ), and then wore a pair of black satin peeptoe Christian Louboutin heels and a chain necklace (like Calico Juno Designs' 3 Circle Multi Chain Necklace in Gold ). She completed her look with her signature winged eye makeup, a bright red manicure, and a textured clutch (try Inge Christopher's similar Paradiso Clutch in Pewter ). In other Lauren news, she recently spoke out to Glamour about her body issues, where she said: " IÂ&rsquo;ve never felt a push to be stick thin. I work out and eat healthy, so mostly itÂ&rsquo;s about being in shape and having energy. But about a year ago, I looked down and thought, I have cellulite. Where did that come from? I went through treatments; [my body] was like, itÂ&rsquo;s not going anywhere. " Can any of you relate? Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 20 2010 in Hollywood, CA. Out on the town with her boyfriend, Lauren Conrad was photographed leaving Colony in Hollywood on August 20 after celebrating her friend's birthday at the hotspot. Opting for a body-con LBD with her nude quilted Chanel bag and a pair of satin Louboutin peeptoe heels, Lauren accessorized minimally with her staple charm necklace and a silver ring (try CC Skye's Pave Knuckle Ring in Silver ). For a few options that are similar to Lauren's dress on CoutureCandy are Fernanda Carneiro's Regina Dress in Black , Splendid's looser fitting Layered Dress in Black and Carter's edgier Twist on The Classic Dress in Black , which utilizes the super hot mesh trend of the moment. Lauren's still sporting her tri-tone hairstyle, and given all of these elements, are you into her look? Is this something you would wear for a night on the town? Her style always proves to be quite simple, but she knows what works for her and sticks to it. Would you wish she took a few more fashion risks, though? If you were a fan of "The Hills," you'll remember the moment when Lauren and ex-friend Heidi Montag fought over Heidi's then boo Spencer, and Lauren infamously called Spencer "a sucky person!" It seems that now that Heidi and Spencer are allegedly on the outs, Heidi is seeing Lauren's side a little more clearly. Heidi tweeted to Lauren: " @LaurenConrad you were right! Spencer is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sucky!!! " Wow. Do you believe the whole Heidi/Spencer drama or do you think they're still working together for press? Lauren is so much wiser to have taken the high road! Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 14 2010 in Los Angeles, CA. Always up for a good time, Lauren Conrad was caught by the paparazzi as she left a house party in LA on August 14, a party that was also attended by Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz. When it came to Lauren's wardrobe, however, it seems as though she raided the closet of her BFF Lo Bosworth. Lo just wore the same printed romper to an event at Drai's back on August 3 , in case you'd forgotten. So, who do you think worked this romper better, readers? In addition to her playful romper (I love 7 for All Mankind's monochromatic Romper by 7 in Grey ), Lauren nabbed one of her many lustworthy Chanel bags and slipped into a cozy black cardigan (try Bailey 44's Command & Control Cardi in Black , or go for a sheer look with Wit.'s Light Weight Boyfriend Cardi in Black ). She finished off her look with a neutral pair of strappy flat sandals (check out Gwyneth Shoes' Briee Strap Sandal in Orange ) and her favorite oversized Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses. I'm really interested to hear which former "Hills" gal you think rocked this look better, which proves to be versatile enough for daytime and nighttime wear. In case you were wondering, photos from Lauren's LC by Lauren Conrad for Kohls Fall 2010 collection has been released - click here to check them out. The newest collection in her Kohl's line is described: " This fall we're seeing lots of feminine touches like ruffles, floral prints, flouncy skirts, and lace, but nothing is too sweet. Rather, the girly vibe is casual yet sophisticated, and decidedly California-chic, expressed by relaxed silhouettes, sexy leggings and a subdued color palette. Prices range from $34 for a ruffle-tiered chiffon tank top; $50 for a lace-back cardigan to $70 for a motorcycle jacket. " Any of you keen on picking up any of these pieces? Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 06 2010 in Huntington Beach, CA. Beach babe Lauren Conrad was spotted at the Hurley Walk The Walk Teen Fashion Competition that was held at the Huntington Beach Pier on August 6, where she served as a judge as a fashion competition that supports high school arts programs. In the competition, 6 high schools presented their runway versions of "Friday Night Football" meets "The Runway" in hopes of winning the $25,000 prize for their school. For her beachy ensemble, Lauren slipped into a pair of little black shorts (try Joe's Jeans' Ex-Lover Short in Conner ) and an oversized patterned tank (both Ella Moss' Print Tank and Scrapbook Originals' Selene Tank in Blue are similar), and finished things up with a huge pair of sunnies, a single bangle on her right wrist, and her favorite Miu Miu heels (get the look with Coye Nokes' beach-worthy Grace Wedge Sandal in Cognac ). The two-tone hair color she's been sporting lately is still in full effect here, as her platinum ends offset her brunette roots. Are you a fan of this two-tone hair that so many celebs have been sporting lately? In other Lauren news, the former "Hills" star is launching another (a third!) clothing line. Lauren says: " ItÂ&rsquo;s a contemporary womenÂ&rsquo;s line. Where KohlÂ&rsquo;s is a lot of daywear, itÂ&rsquo;s a lot of basics. This will be more specialty basics, more of a boutique line. It will be at a higher price point. It will be very different. ItÂ&rsquo;s one thing to work with a huge retailer like KohlÂ&rsquo;s and there is so much you get to do, but there is a little more of a thrill of doing it on your own. ItÂ&rsquo;s a lot more work, itÂ&rsquo;s a lot more stressful, but itÂ&rsquo;s something I love doing so IÂ&rsquo;m really looking forward to it. " I wonder what Lauren's "very different" clothing line is going to look like! Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 14 2010 in Los Angeles, CA. After attending the series finale event for "The Hills" the prior evening, Lauren Conrad was photographed heading to her car after dining at Philippe Chow on Melrose in LA on July 14, keeping her look light and summery in typical Lauren fashion.

We all know by now that Lauren loves to match her bag to her shoes or her belt (exhibits A and B ), and tonight was no exception to the rule! Lauren paired a camel colored bag (check out Rough Roses' Francesca Carry All in Camel ) with a pair of strappy heels. How are you feeling about Conrad's floral look here - do you love it, or is it a bit too cutesy for your taste? While we all know that Lauren's books are wildly successful, it's being reported that for her upcoming spinoff of her "L.A. Candy" series, she is going much darker in tone. Wait, who knew Lauren had a dark side? Well apparently she does. She says, " I'm going to take Madison from the book and do a darker series. I already wrote a little bit and it was really fun. " Lauren just finished writing the third book of the "L.A. Candy" trilogy, and while the protagonist of the book - Jane - isn't always the biggest fan of the limelight that being famous brings, LC thinks it would be fun to explore the other side of the coin. She says, " I think it would be really fun to do it the other way, with someone who loves it. Someone who loves the fame and plays that game well ." Hmmm... I wonder who she might be referring to? Lauren Conrad seen on Jun 15 2010 in Los Angeles, CA.

Lauren added on a tan woven belt (like Linea Pelle Collection's Vintage Pieced Belt in Vintage Cognac ) and a pair of matching strappy Louboutin heels, and finished off her look with her signature coral charm necklace and a seafoam green manicure.

Lauren seems to be really into wearing maxi dresses with sandals lately, as she was also spotted donning a similar look as she left the salon on May 21 . For her sunny Malibu outing, Lauren chose a tie dye maxi dress (Lotta Stensson's Dip Dye Halter Dress in Grey is very similar) with her favorite Rainbow sandals (Gwyneth Shoes' Athena T Strap Sandal in Grey is fab), a pair of oversized aviator shades, and a simple black bracelet (check out Ettika's Faceted Bead Strands Leather Bracelet in Black or Erica Anenberg's Jujubee LOVE Bracelet in Grey ).

Lauren proves that basic can still be beautiful in a flowy heather grey tank dress (just like T by Alexander Wang's Classic Tank Dress in Heather Grey ) and a pair of Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses. For the rest of her ensemble, Lauren kept the accessories to a minimum, opting only for her signature charm necklace (try Maya Brenner Designs' The Charm-ing Necklace In Gold ), an ivory tote (I love Zambos & Siega's Mansfield Bag in Stone ), and a solitary gold bangle (check out Jules Smith's Super Stud Bangle in Yellow Gold ). A simple pair of uber-comfortable Rainbow sandals finished things off. Give us your thoughts, readers... are you loving Lauren's look here? For those of you who are big Conrad fans, you'll be pleased to know that more details about her style book (and the cover!) have been released. Click here to check out the cover. In the book, Lauren will obviously reveal her style secrets, but there will be much more included as well. Says Conrad: " The first book tour I went on, I had the opportunity to meet thousands and thousands of fans. The majority of the questions were about fashion. It was fun to share all the things I had learned. " According to People Style Watch , the book will offer " tons of never-before-seen photos and relatable advice from Conrad herself, along with her glam squad, 'personal stories, live and learn stories,' and yes, even 'a couple of high school horror stories.' " Who of you is excited to pick up a copy when this hits bookstores in October? Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 19 2010 in New York, NY. Lauren Conrad was spotted participating in some promotional duties as she made an appearance at the Hershey Times Square Store in NYC on April 19, promoting Reese's Peanut Butter Cups by signing a petition to declare "I Love Reese's Day." Um... ok? At least Lauren looked gorgeous, as she chose a champagne colored bubble dress (for similar dress options on CoutureCandy, check out KEEMiA's Simone Draped Overlay Dress in Pearl , Karen Zambos' Jessica Dress in Metallic or 43.46 aggaj's Pascale Dress in Champagne ) that she paired with a braided waist belt (try Linea Pelle Collection's Vintage Pieced Belt in Vintage Cognac ) and matching stilettos (check out Gwyneth Shoes' Omyrah in Gold ). Lauren finished off her look with glistening blonde tresses and a single gold bangle on her left forearm (try CC Skye's Mini Spike Bracelet in Gold ). I think Lauren looks really pretty here, do you agree readers? So what's behind Lauren's appearance at the Hershey store? Lauren says, " I've always loved Reese's Peanut Butter Cups - who doesn't? When I found out that my favorite treat was campaigning to declare I Love Reese's Day, I had to be among the first to sign the petition. Join me and help declare I Love Reese's Day a holiday at www.ILoveReesesDay.com. " I bet she made a pretty penny for this deal! Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 06 2010 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was photographed heading into celebrity hotspot Trousdale in West Hollywood on April 6, seeming to be in a good mood as she smiled on her way in. For her night out look, Lauren paired a black silk romper (try KEEMiA's Francesca Silk Jumper in Black or Tt Collection's Stacy in Black ) with an oversized blazer (check out Isabel Lu's Flap Oversized Blazer in Navy Black ) and her trusty Chanel tote, along with a pair of patterned tights and classic Christian Louboutin pumps. For the final touches, Lauren wore the delicate charm necklace that she never takes off and a simple bracelet (similar to Ettika's Baby Gold Dust and Turquoise Bracelet ) and wore her hair in a messy side fishtail braid. What are your thoughts on Conrad's outfit here, readers - do you think the tights work well with this look, or should she have gone bare-legged? A source inside the club spied Lauren with boyfriend Kyle Howard and told People, "They made a few laps around L.A.'s Trousdale Lounge, but ultimately Lauren seemed more interested in spending the night out with Kyle than hanging out with all her friends. So, the two retreated to the corner where they held hands, kissed and cuddled Â&ndash; and continued to do so even when they were joined by a few pals on the couch. " How cute! The source then continued, " Across the club, it was business usual: Paris Hilton was dancing her heart out as the center of attention, while Ashlee Simpson-Wentz spent time with a girlfriend. " Seems like quite the night to be at Trousdale! Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 12 2010 in Denver, CO. Lauren Conrad has given us quite the slew of public appearances and outfit photographs lately, as she's been on the promotional trail for her new book "Sweet Little Lies," which is already at the top of the New York Times bestseller list. For her appearance on February 5 in Boston, Lauren donned an oversized black blazer (like Zoa's Classic Fit Blazer in Black ) atop a blush colored camisole (check out Rachel Pally's Zoe V-Neck Cami Top in Ballet ) and leather leggings (for a great basic pair, try Alice + Olivia's Front Zip Legging in Black ). Conrad accessorized with a sparkly statement necklace (like Kuo Ting Jewelry's Japanese White and Gray Pearl Necklace ) and edgy (for her) gladiator heels. Loose waves and a red manicure completed her look. On February 12, Lauren popped up in Denver, Colorado, rocking a much more prim and proper ensemble. With a slicked-back 'do and a cherry red lip, Conrad tucked a striped tank (check out Rails' Deanna Striped Tank in Navy/White ) into a black pencil skirt (similar to Amberlynn's Zipper Skirt in Black ), changed her polish (from red to black), and slipped into her old familiar black peeptoe Christian Louboutin pumps. Which Lauren look do you like better, everyone? I am feeling the look on the left, personally. Lauren is in the process of cementing herself as a successful brand, given that her sophomore literary effort has already become a bestseller. She said, " It's so gratifying for my second book to be so successful and it was so fun to write. The characters were already developed so I really enjoyed the process so much more this time around. All the characters are like my friends now. " Lauren continues, " I just sat in bed writing and it was the best process. Who gets to work from home in their PJ's? I'm just so thankful to my fans. Everyone is coming out to see me in the snow. I just can't believe it. " Congrats, Lauren! Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 03 2010 in New York, NY. Former "Hills" babe Lauren Conrad was spotted working the promotional trail for her new book "Sweet Little Lies" in New York, starting with an appearance at Barnes & Noble bookstore in Tribeca on February 3. For her in-store appearance, Lauren wore a vibrant patterned mini dress (for two similar options, try either Woo's Sol Printed Dress in Mountain Sunset or Meghan Fabulous' Chesney Mini Dress in Teal ) with opaque black tights and suede Christian Louboutin pumps. She kept her accessories minimal, opting only for a few silver rings, a cherry red manicure, and a low ponytail. The following day, February 4, Conrad stepped out to film a guest spot on "The Wendy Williams Show" dressed a bit more casually. She picked a short black coat (for a navy version with a similar silhouette, try Woo's Martin Coat in Navy ) with a grey scarf (like Raw 7's Shredded Tube Scarf in Grey ), Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses, a gorgeous Chanel bag, and a pair of black peeptoes. Which outfit do you prefer Lauren in, casual and chic on the left, or pretty and polished on the right? Lauren recently spoke to Seventeen Magazine about how her career was boosted by appearing on "The Hills" (duh), saying, " When the show started to be successful, I realized it could be a platform for getting into fashion. But in the beginning, I was 17 and I just wanted to be on TV. I wish I could give myself more credit and say I had a whole business plan, but really I just thought MTV was cool and that it would be fun. " Have any of you bought her new book yet? Lauren Conrad seen on Jan 22 2010 in Las Vegas, NV. Lauren Conrad was photographed smiling and waving as she appeared at The Bank Nightclub at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, NV on January 22, looking stunning in a fitted red Herve Leger dress. Cue up the Chris DeBurgh classic "Lady In Red"! For a selection of other fiery hued frocks on CoutureCandy, check out Sky's Peter Mini Dress in Red , Eva Franco's Filipa Dress in Carmen , or Whitley Kros' Emma Dress in Red , or for a slinky, similar silhouette in a bright orange shade, try Lotta Stensson's Shirred Mini Tube Dress in Orange .

Readers, weigh in! Lauren hosted a night at The Bank to promote her newest book, "Sweet Little Lies," her sophomore effort after "LA Candy." Lauren posted to her official Twitter account: " Haaaaaaaaaaaaappy Friday! Heading to a couple fittings then off to The Vegas with @jillyhendrix, Nate and KP! Yaaay! " I wonder what wild and crazy things those girls got up to in Vegas? Looks like we'll never know, however - since she's no longer followed around by a camera crew. If you aren't already, be sure to follow @couturecandy1 on Twitter :) Lauren Conrad seen on Jan 15 2010 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was photographed doing her thing at the Kari Feinstein Golden Globes Style Lounge held at Zune LA yesterday, January 15, accompanied by BFF Lo Bosworth. For Lauren's easygoing look, she started with a pair of Levi's denim leggings (get the look with James Jeans' Twiggy Jean in China Doll ) and paired them with a patterned silk blouse (try Zoa's Deep V-Neck Top in Fiji , or for a patterned tank top, check out Twelfth Street by Cynthia Vincent's Racerback Slip Tank in Multi ) and cutout brown heels. For the finishing touches of her look, Lauren wore her signature charm necklace (like Maya Brenner Designs' The Charm-ing Necklace in Gold ) along with a few gold bangles and minimal makeup. What are your thoughts on Lauren's look here, readers - hot or not? While Lauren has repeatedly said in the past that plastic surgery is not her thing, it seems that frenemy Heidi Montag is beyond obsessed. She unveiled her unrecognizable look in People Magazine this week, and for those of you who haven't seen Heidi's new face, check out the before and after here . Quite the difference! In the past, Lauren was quoted as saying: " ItÂ&rsquo;s hard because do try to be beautiful on your own and be happy with the way you look, or do you listen to the criticism? They put [young stars] on this platform, and they tear them apart and then they criticize them even more for changing themselves. ItÂ&rsquo;s hard to say. I think you just try and be confident with the way you are. " What do you think of Heidi's transformation? Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 31 2009 in Hollywood, CA. Always up for an evening of fun, Stephanie Pratt , Lauren Conrad , and Lo Bosworth were spotted posing for photographers as they rang in the New Year at Beso in Hollywood on December 31. It seems like even though Lauren said sayonara to "The Hills," she still loves to party with her former castmates - remember when they all posed together at the Maxim Magazine Event at Voyeur Nightclub on November 11 ? For their NYE ensembles, let's break it down one by one, starting with Stephanie. She paired an uber-sexy shiny gold top with a black mini skirt, black heels, an oversized cocktail ring and a bubblegum pink lip. Get her look by starting with LaROK's Rayna Top in Tan , which offers a bit more coverage, and pairing with Tt Collection's Carrie Skirt in Black and Megan Greene's Ninotchka Ring in Midnight . Stephanie's look is a bit brazen, but I guess if not on New Year's Eve, then when? Next up is Lauren, who played it a little bit safer in a classic LBD (try either Sue Wong's Poly Krinkle Slip Dress in Black , Tricia Fix's Ladytron Mini in Snake , or Isabel Lu's great Little Black Dress ) with a silver chain necklace and black peeptoe Louboutin heels. She seemed to be in a more festive mood than her two galpals, donning a gaudy, cheapo NYE hat and silver horn in her right hand. Rounding out the three amigos, we have Lo who, like Steph, went with something sparkly, donning an embellished black and gold mini dress (check out either LaROK's Sweetie Sequin Dress in Wood or Susana Monaco's String Dress in Mod Dot for two more casual options) with drop earrings and a black suede pump. Now for the moment of truth: which gal do you think looks the best at Beso? I think it's the combination of her pretty hairstyle, dress and minimal makeup and accessories that makes Lo win this one for me. Do you agree? Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 11 2009 in West Hollywood, CA. Is it just me, or have we been seeing less and less of Lauren Conrad ever since she left "The Hills"? She either goes out (shopping, lunching, partying) a lot less, or she's just not photographed as much if she is going out. Either way, it's nice to see her out in the holiday spirit on December 11 as she hit up Crown Bar in West Hollywood with beau Kyle Howard, fully decked out in her festive best. Lauren started with a wine colored bow-like skirt (get a similar effect with Walter's Satin Crepe Pleat Skirt in Chocolate ) and then paired a ruffled camisole (I love the rich purple shade of Twelfth Street by Cynthia Vincent's Ruffled Front Cami in Purple ) with a black boyfriend blazer (the red and green plaid detailing on the inner sleeve of The Battalion's Boyfriend Blazer in Black is so fun for this time of year) and one of her classic Chanel bags. She completed her look with a pair of satin Christian Louboutin peeptoe heels with bow detailing, and her trademark dainty charm necklace (like Maya Brenner Designs' The Charm-ing Necklace in Gold ). The final touch? An updo with a black bow strategically placed on it, that looks like it just came off of a present. So cute! What do you think, readers - did Lauren go overboard on the whole bow motif, from the skirt to the hair to the shoes? For those of you who are interested in what Lauren's been up to ever since leaving her hit MTV show (which just got picked up for ANOTHER season, fyi) - Conrad is working on her first style guide, which is rumored to debut in fall 2010. She says, " I think fashion should be fun and reflective of who you are. When you wear clothes you feel good in, it shows in everything you do. I know this guide will offer simple, practical tips to help anyone look fabulous. " Are any of you out there interested in style tips from Ms. Conrad? Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 11 2009 in West Hollywood, CA. The girls of "The Hills" (well, two of them at least) were spotted out on the red carpet of the launch party for the Assassin's Creed II video game hosted by Maxim Magazine at Voyeur Nightclub in West Hollywood last night, November 11, as Lo Bosworth , Stephanie Pratt , and Lauren Conrad struck a unified pose in front of the photogs. It's nice to see that Lauren joins her former co-stars from time to time for these glitzy shindigs, and as bad as it is to say this, she's probably loving the fact that the ratings on "The Hills" have dropped so drastically since she left MTV's popular reality show. For their party-rific outfits, let's start with Lo. She paired a demure French Connection black mini (for similar options, check out Karen Zambos' Sydney Dress in Black or Tt Collection's Audry Dress in Black ) with Prada booties and a sophisticated updo. Stephanie, on the other hand, chose a glittery sequined frock (like Karen Zambos' long sleeved Twiggy Dress in Metallic or LaROK's Sequined Rolly Dress in Black ) that turned out to be more sheer and revealing than she initially thought - her hot pink panties are on full display! She finished off her look with a classic black clutch and YSL Divine heels. Lauren picked a pale pink mini dress (take a look at Gold Hawk's Tribal Queen Shift Dress in Soft Praline ) that she topped with Ashish's sparkling boyfriend blazer (similar to 7 for All Mankind's >Sequin Blazer in Ash ) and paired with her trademark gold charm necklace with a coral accent. What are your thoughts, readers - who knocked their look out of the park for the Maxim event, and if you had to choose, which look do you like the best? I have to give it to Lauren on this one! Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 11 2009 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted posing on the red carpet of Hollywood Life's 6th Annual 2009 Hollywood Style Awards, held at the Armand Hammer Museum on October 6, there to support friend Brody Jenner who won the Young Men's Hollywood Style Icon Award (no comment). For Lauren's stylish ensemble, she paired Mara Hoffman's Spring 2010 floral frock (for similar, fun options, try Nu by Marc Anthony's Printed Dress in Print D , Single Dress' Beaded Floral Print Dress in Rose , or Pink Polka Dot's Pink/Black Abstract Dress ) with a studded waist belt (I'm into CC Skye's Hermes-esque Ashley Belt in Black ) and her favorite charm necklace and double finger ring (similar to Erica Anenberg's Pewter Double Finger Ring in Silver ). She finished her look with a simple pair of classic black pumps. What are your thoughts on Lauren's look here, readers - personally, I think Lauren looks great when she wears a young and vibrant dress like this. In other LC news, do you remember when Lauren said that she wanted her BFF Lo to star in "LA Candy" the movie ? Turns out that was more of a joke than anything! Lo tells E! News : " I would love to make a cameo, but I don't think I could handle a big role because I'm not an actress. A cameo would be really fun. " And for those of you who have commented about the, ahem, not so subtle changes in Stephanie Pratt's face a few entries down, Lauren is speaking out about her opinion of her former castmates going under the knife. Conrad says, " ItÂ&rsquo;s hard because youÂ&rsquo;re in that position where youÂ&rsquo;re being criticized for everything. ItÂ&rsquo;s hard because do you ignore it, and try to be beautiful on your own and be happy with the way you look, or do you listen to the criticism. They put them on this platform, and they tear them apart and then they criticize them even more for changing themselves. ItÂ&rsquo;s hard to say. I think you just try and be confident with the way you are. " Do you agree with Lauren's stance, readers? Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 18 2009 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was photographed at the Kate Somerville Emmy Gifting Suite Event in Los Angeles yesterday, September 18, mingling with skin expert Somerville while scooping up her luxe products. Lauren, looking polished as always, started with a loose golden tunic (for two similar frocks, try Juicy Couture's Jackie Ruffle Dress in Beausoleil or Ingwa Melero's intricate Charmeause Lotus Mini Dress in Chartreuse - or for similar silhouettes in different shades, check out Velvet's comfortable Charonna Dress in Brown or 12th Street by Cynthia Vincent's absolutely beautiful Beaded Neck Dress in Grey ) that she belted (similar to Julie K Handbags' Tess Belt in Golden ) and paired with delicate heels, a gold bangle (take a look at Rachel Leigh Jewelry's Sweet Tooth Bangle in Gold ) and her signature single hair braid. What are your thoughts on Lauren's look here - basic, yes... but pretty, no? Lauren was spotted earlier today in Santa Monica participating in a Kohl's Department Store-sponsored beach clean up, and I can only assume she was there for one of two reasons. The first, that she actually cares about keeping our beaches clean (she did grow up on the beach in Laguna, after all) - and the second, that she was contractually obliged to be there, due to the fact that she just released her new clothing line at Kohl's. Lauren tells Us Weekly that her new line is " a little more casual... trying to take that California style and make it accessible everywhere. " A rep from the department store added in " We are confident the LC Lauren Conrad collection brings customers both the contemporary style and the world-class brand. " While the collection contains mostly skinny jeans, flowy tops, and pretty dresses, do you have any interest in checking it out? Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 06 2009 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted at the Warren Tricomi Salon on Melrose Ave. on August 7 for a quick trim and blow out, looking pretty peeved to spot the photographers waiting for her outside the salon. To start her look, Lauren picked her absolute fave heels, her tan Miu Miu Double Cross Platform Sandals, and paired them with skintight skinny blue denim (like Proportion of Blu's Skinny Jean in Slate Blu ), and an oversized striped tee (for similar striped options, try Rails' Deanna Striped Tank in Navy/White or James Perse's dress version, the Stripe Drop Dress in Charcoal ). Lauren completed her look with oversized round sunnies and a leather tote (I love the hue of Carla Mancini's Whipstitch Double Handle Tote in Teal ). What is your opinion on Conrad's casual salon 'fit? For those of you who thought that the Lauren Conrad sex tape drama had finally subsided, think again! In the new issue of Playboy , Lauren's frenemy Heidi Pratt mentions moments of "The Hills" that she's not proud of, and of course the sex tape came up. She said, " Like when you apologized to Lauren Conrad for the sex-tape rumors so she would come to the wedding, when we know for a fact that she did have a sex tape. ItÂ&rsquo;s not just about Lauren, because sheÂ&rsquo;s not even on the show this season. Which is fine with me. " Evil schemer Spencer continued, " I was lying about being apologetic. And I hate lying. Yes, I facilitated that rumor, but it was true. Lauren was acting like she was little miss perfect goody two-shoes while [ex] Jason Wahler was trying to shop the tape. That tape exists! " Give a rest already you two! Stop trying to use Lauren to further your "careers"! Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 28 2009 in Beverly Hills, CA. Lauren Conrad and Lo Bosworth were spotted doing some damage at Barney's New York in Beverly Hills on July 28, both toting some supersized Barney's bags as they left their shopping excursion. For their retail jaunt, Lauren started with a summery floral mini dress (check out options from Prairie New York, like the Barnes Dress in Azalea , or Gold Hawk, and the Morph Print Short Dress in Peach ) under a lightweight grey cardigan (try Signorelli's Love Tree Button Cashmere Cardigan in Ash ), oversized round sunnies, a tan leather tote (like Antoinette Lee Designs' Stella Bag in Tan ) with matching leather and cork wedge heels. Lo, on the other hand, chose an oversized white button-up (patterned with bunnies!) that she rolled up the sleeves of (check out 3J Workshop's Ring of Roses Blouse in Rose or James Perse's Luxury Contrast Panel Shirt in Tearose ) and tucked it into a pair of high-waisted grey skinny jeans (try Diesel's Cuddy 8tn Jean in Grey ), finishing off her look with a pair of black peeptoe stilettos. What are your thoughts, readers - who is rockin' their look better, here? Fashion faceoff! For those of you Conrad fans out there, I'm sure you've scooped up a copy of her book, "LA Candy." Now, it seems that there are loud whisperings that Lauren's book may take the leap to the big screen. Daily News is reporting that Lauren is definitely interested, quoting her a saying " We're hoping for a movie deal. I'm working on [adapting the book for the big screen] right now, but I don't want to commit to anything until I see all my options. We have had a lot of exciting news in that respect, though. " A source continues, " Lauren's goal is to get into producing Â&mdash; it always was. It was always to make 'L.A. Candy' into a film or TV show. She's been in talks about it. No deal [is] in place just yet, but the film is her ultimate goal. She would never star in it because she doesn't want to be an actress. She spent so long on TV, [she] would love to produce. " Wow, that's a lot to take in! What do you think, if her book was turned into a movie, would you check it out? Either way, big congrats to L! Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 07 2009 in Malibu, CA. Lauren Conrad and BFF Lo Bosworth were spotted striking a sporty slash playful pose at the National Pro Lacrosse Tour BBQ at the Sierra Mist Beach House in Malibu on July 7, and from the looks of things, the girls definitely enjoyed their time in the sun. Lauren and Lo kept their looks breezy and cool, as Lo chose a lightwash denim shirt dress (for a similar silhouette, check out Splendid's Check Shirt Dress in Navy/White ) with an oversized pair of brown sunnies and a few gold bangles on her right wrist, while Lauren picked a blue bikini (I love the unusual shade of FrenchFifty Swimwear's Alba Bikini in Steel Blue ) under a sheer white cover up (take your pick between V i X Swimwear's Ruffle White Tunic with Gold Thread and Da-Nang's Gauze Tunic in White ) with black Wayfarers and a midnight blue mani. Proving she's still a beach girl at heart, Lauren finished off her outfit with a pair of sand-colored Rainbow sandals. No Loubs at the pool for this girl! Lauren's first novel, "LA Candy," is doing very well, as the semi-biographical story has come in at #1 on the New York Times Best-Seller List two weeks in a row! Wow, for a girl with really no professional writing experience, that is quite a coup! Lo, on the other hand, has found a new boyfriend, and showed him the Verizon Wireless Matt Leinart Foundation Event at Lucky Strikes Lanes & Lounge in LA this past Monday. People.com reports that his name is Scott Hochstadt, and that he is a professional lacrosse player. A source close to Lo says, " ItÂ&rsquo;s new but they are both really happy ." Lauren and Lo are always up to something! Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 02 2009 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted with her BFF, Lo Bosworth, letting loose and having a good time at Bar Delux in Hollywood back on July 2, and showed her patriotic spirit with her red and blue mismatched manicure. Do you like this multicolored nail look - or is it only appropriate for holidays? For her nighttime, party-mode look, Lauren started with a sparkly maroon mini skirt (try Tracy Reese's Pegged Skirt in Vanilla and Camel for a more conservative fit) to which she tucked a black tank (similar to Ella Moss' Parisienne Tank in Black ) into, and then donned a grey blazer (go a tad bit more casual - and comfortable! - with Smitten's One-Button Belted Sweatshirt Jacket in Heather Grey ) to ward off those night breezes. Lauren then kept her accessories to a minimum, toting along a black handbag with gold chain detail (similar to CC Skye's LuLu Day Bag in Black ), and adding a silver bangle and a pair of black suede Christian Louboutin pumps. What are your overall thoughts on Conrad's look here - are you diggin' it? While it seems for a brief, glimmering moment, Lauren and arch-frenemy, Heidi Montag, were friends again - however, now it seems that the two are right back to doing what comes natural: hating each other. In the new issue of Harper's Bazaar , Lauren has some not-so-nice things to say about Speidi. Regarding Heidi's spread in Playboy , Lauren quipped, " They're not going to pay for themselves ," obviously referring to Heidi's, ahem, assets. When the mag asked if she'd ever pose for Playboy , she responded, " Everyone makes those choices and wants to do different things. I just don't have any interest in showing my body in something like that. That's a little personal. " She also wouldn't don medical masks while at a Mexican airport, a la Speidi during the height of Swine Flu. " The face mask on vacation: I don't know if it was so funny because people really were being affected by that disease. But otherwise [Heidi and Spencer] are very entertaining. You have to laugh. " So, once and for all, which team are you on... team Lauren or team Speidi? Lauren Conrad seen on Jun 16 2009 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted posing with her newly-penned book, "LA Candy," at a book signing at a Barnes & Noble book store at The Grove in Los Angeles yesterday evening, June 16. Keep an eye out for Lauren, as she'll be popping up at bookstores all over the country for her book tour. Last night, Lauren picked a kimono-sleeve blouse with an almost paint splattered or tie dye pattern (check out Cake Couture's cool selection of tie dyed sweaters, like the Honeycomb Tunic Sweater in Black or the Organic Tie Dye Sweater in Jade , or, for a dress in a similar style vein as Lauren's blouse, try Tricia Fix's Kimono Dress in Blue Print ) tucked into a high waisted black mini skirt (take a look at Amberlynn's Zipper Skirt in Black ) and accessorized with a few rings and a pair of black Christian Louboutin pumps. The look is typical Lauren - what are your thoughts, readers? Does the patterned top add a little extra spice to Conrad's otherwise bland outfit? For those of you interested in Lauren's book, it is the story of a young woman, Jane, who moves to Los Angeles for an exciting internship and becomes a hot reality television star. I guess what they say is true - it's best to write what you know! The first of three books, Lauren says, " There are things Jane says that I sometimes wish I had the nerve to say out loud. In a way, 'LA Candy' is an extension of 'The Hills.' My characters are based on so many people I've met over the years. And Jane has a bit of me, but also a bit of many girls I've met who are new to this whole 'fame' thing. Jane does things I wouldn't, and that was so much fun for me to write. " Additionally, Lauren has high hopes that her novel can be adapted for the small screen. She says, " It's one of my hopes. We're going to start working on that when I get back from my book tour. " What do you think, readers - does this sound like a good idea? It would basically be a scripted version of "The Hills," not that that isn't scripted enough already! Lauren Conrad seen on Jun 10 2009 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was seen running a few errands around town in LA on June 10, gearing up for her "LA Candy" book launch and party later that night (complete with a pink carpet!) at the Thompson Hotel. For her easy daytime look that was composed of casual basics, Lauren started with a basic white v-neck tee (like Splendid's Very Long V-Neck Tee in White ) messily tucked into a pair of deep indigo skinnies (try Denim of Virtue's Patience 5 Pocket Tapered Jean in Night Club ) and accessorized with a chestnut belt (try Pellemelle's Pilgrim Belt in Chestnut ) and matching oversized tote (similar to Linea Pelle's Dylan Large Bowler Bag in Cognac ). Finishing off her look, Lauren chose a pair of oversized Wayfarers, a delicate charm necklace, and proving that she's still a beach girl at heart, a comfortable pair of Rainbow sandals. While of course it is a basic look, this is the perfect outfit for casually kicking around LA and not seeming like you're trying too hard. While I'm sure you've all heard by now that Paris Hilton and her boytoy of the month, Doug Reinhardt, have called it quits, Lauren has offered up her two cents on the topic, seeing as though she used to date Doug. Says Conrad, " [We] dated my senior year of high school. He moved back and then it was like, 'Oh, we'll pick up where we left off'... for a couple of weeks.' " When she heard of the breakup, she exclaimed, " I didn't know that! I thought they were a good match. " Of reports that Hilton and Reinhardt were on the marriage path, Lauren says, " She was going to marry a lot of people. But he had fun. That's all that matters. " What do you think, do you agree with Lauren? Lauren Conrad seen on May 31 2009 in Universal City, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted taking a walk on the wild side (for her) at the 2009 MTV Move Awards last night, May 31, held at the the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City. Usually playing it safe and sticking to classier looks, Lauren opted for a much edgier-than-the-norm dress for her red carpet appearance (this day was also a pretty big milestone for Conrad, as her last episode of "The Hills" aired just prior to the Movie Awards). In a black and burgundy ruffled Moschino mini dress (Shumaq makes two dresses, the flashy Isabelle Dress in Silver and the more understated Marrisa Dress in Black with slightly similar silhouettes to Lauren's) with Christian Louboutin lace-up heels, a matching maroon manicure and her trademark charm necklace (try out Maya Brenner Designs' The Everything Necklace in Gold ), Lauren seemed to be rockin' some major hair extensions styled into thick, beachy waves. What do you think of Lauren's look - do you think taking a chance paid off? TMZ.com wasn't so kind to Lauren, saying, " LC came straight from a Mexican bullfight -- TORO! " Ouch! That's a wee bit harsh, don't you think? For those of you who caught Lauren's exit from "The Hills," what did you think? Overall, I'd say she made a pretty gracious exit, paving way for Kristin Cavallari's trouble making entrance. "The bitch is back" the teaser proclaimed, and from the sneak preview they showed of Kristin starting drama with Audrina, I'd say that's a pretty accurate description! Lauren Conrad seen on May 25 2009 in Toronto. Lauren Conrad was seen heading to film a segment for "The Hills" After-Show in Toronto, Canada on May 25, meeting fans and smiling for the overwhelming collection of photographers poised to snap Lauren's picture. For her appearance outfit, Lauren started with a tight-fitting leather mini skirt (for a longer option, check out Amberlynn's Zipper Skirt in Black ) with a sheer white top (like Da-Nang's Gauze Tunic in White ) and voluminous white scarf, and finished things off with a pair of classic black pumps, a bright turquoise manicure, and a few eye-catching bracelets (Ettika's Medium Peace Sign Leather Bracelet in Orange is similar to the one on her left wrist, while Amy DiGregorio's Bourne Bridge Bracelet in Gold is like the one on her right). What are your thoughts on Lauren's look - a classic outfit, or do you wish she didn't play it as safe? For those of you who caught the most recent episode of "The Hills" (and Lauren's second to last), you might have gotten a little choked up when hearing Lauren's heartfelt monologue to Heidi. Lauren said, " I remember being with Jason... and I remember being in that same situation where I felt like without him I would die. And I remember thinking, 'Everything would be perfect if we could go to an island somewhere,' but life isn't an island. You have to have other people in your life. I remember when we first met, you could light up any room. And since you've been with Spencer, I see that light slowly disappearing ." Heidi tried fighting back tears, and them made a pretty swift exit. It's so sad when you're not friends with your friends anymore! However, Lauren is telling Cosmopolitan that producers kept pushing her to run in to Heidi throughout her last season. She says, " What they didnÂ&rsquo;t get is that I didnÂ&rsquo;t want to fight with her anymore. ItÂ&rsquo;s hard to look at somebody who used to be your best friend and say, Â&lsquo;We canÂ&rsquo;t be friends. Too much has happened.Â&rsquo; IÂ&rsquo;m trying to move on, but they wonÂ&rsquo;t let me. And when someone keeps pushing you into the same position well... you get upset. " So I ask you, readers, what are your thoughts on all of this? Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 21 2009 in Los Angeles, CA. "The Hills" were alive in LA on April 21, as Lauren Conrad , Audrina Patridge and Lo Bosworth were spotted (along with Whitney Port, Brody Jenner, and Stephanie Pratt) posing on the red carpet of PaleyFest09 held at the ArcLight Cinemas. The cast was assembled to discuss their hit show, as well as to answer questions from fans. Now we all know that the girls of the show consider themselves to be quite the fashionistas, so I have to ask - who do you think rocked their look better: L.Con, A.Pat, or LoBo? For Lauren's look, she chose a sunny tiered frock (for other yellow numbers, check out Ingwa Melero's Nomi Dress in Yellow and Woo's Sol Dress in Warm Sun ) and belted it with a nude leather belt. Along with matching heels and a single gold bangle (check out Danielle Stevens Jewelry's Single Engraved Bracelet in Gold ), Lauren kept her tresses golden and flowing. Always one to favor more of the dark side of the color spectrum, Audrina slipped into an asymmetrical black silk dress (I love Gold Hawk's Solid Ruffle Dress in Moonless Night , as well as Suzabelle's Agustin Silk Dress in Black ) and grabbed a patent leather clutch (for a cool patent bag with an awesome message, check out Carla Mancini's Leather Tote Peace Sign Symbol Bag in Black ), while keeping her hair messy in a casual updo and matching her bag with a pair of pointed-toe paten heels. Last but not least, Lo went for the pool-blue color scheme, choosing a royal blue satin skirt with a turquoise top (for a longer tunic version, peep Signorelli's Winged Tunic in Turquoise ) tucked in, as well as nude Christian Louboutin stilettos and an electric blue satin clutch with an oversized rosette. It's a tough call, but I think I'm leaning towards liking Lauren's 'fit the most. Readers? The Q&A; session of the evening was definitely an interesting one, and one of the most shocking moments came when Lauren revealed that Spencer acknowledged that he was the person who started the rumors about her having a sex tape. Lauren says, " We actually have it on tape. He takes responsibility and apologizes for it. " Spencer taking responsibility? Talk about a shocker! Another highlight of the evening was when one fan told the cast, " I feel like I know you all so well. I keep looking at you and feeling like youÂ&rsquo;re going to recognize me. " I'm not sure if that's cute or creepy. What do you think, "Hills" viewers - do you feel like you know Lauren & co.? Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 18 2009 in Las Vegas, NV. Lauren Conrad was spotted on the blue carpet of the Grand Opening Event of Wet Republic at MGM Grand Resort and Casino in Las Vegas on April 18, fulfilling her hosting duties and making some extra cash (not like she needs it!). In a tie-dye maxi dress (for cool patterned maxi dresses, take a peek at Tricia Fix's Julie Long Dress in Snake or Plenty by Tracy Reese's Maxi Slip Dress in Red ) and casual flip flops, LC kept her accessories to a minimum, wearing only her favorite charm necklace with an additional gold disc necklace (just like Danielle Stevens Jewelry's 10k Gold Plated Chain Necklace Oval Monogram ), an orange wrap-around bracelet on her left wrist and a few simple gold bangles (try Rachel Leigh's Sweet Tooth Bangle in Gold ) on her right. Simple and pretty - what are your thoughts? Perfect for a pool party, I say! In related "Hills" news, it seems that although Lauren and Heidi have had a tearful reunion on the show that Lauren will not be attending Heidi and Spencer's upcoming nuptials. She was asked by reporters if she was going to be checking the "yes" box on the RSVP card (and yes, Lauren was invited!), Lauren laughed, " Um, probably not. " No surprise there! The gruesome twosome had a "wedding" in Mexico that they decided not to make legal back in the States, and now are doing it for real (and of course in front of MTV cameras). What do you think - are you surprised that Lauren won't be attending? Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 19 2009 in Hollywood, CA. "Hills" cutie Lauren Conrad was spotted leaving popular sushi hotspot Katsuya in Hollywood on March 19, toting along a new tan quilted Chanel bag for her night of sake and sashimi. I definitely am liking this one a lot better than her usual black Chanel bag, don't you agree? In a floral blouse perfect for springtime (try similar options from Cake Couture and their pretty Silk Wrap Blouse in Mix , or a more abstract print, like Walter's Neon Watercolor Print Blouse in Pink Multi ) paired with medium wash skinny jeans (like 7 for All Mankind's Quilted Roxanne Jean in Hawaii ), Lauren accessorized with the dainty charm necklace (try Robyn Rhodes' very similar Bree Drop with Leaf Necklace in Rose Quartz ) that she wears everyday and a few key gold bracelets (try piling on Rachel Leigh's Sweet Tooth Bangle in Gold ). The finishing touch? The playful lace bra peeking out from under her blouse. Another pretty and classy look for Lauren - while she may not be paving any new ground on the fashion forefront, there is no denying that she knows how to dress fun and youthfully, and perfect for her age and body type. Weigh in readers... I know you love to! For those of you Lauren fans out there, you might be disappointed to hear that Lauren's line is going to be put on pause indefinitely. Her rep says, " In light of the economic climate, Lauren has decided to completely rethink her line and design with more high-end fabricsÂ&hellip; things she couldn't do the first time around. With everything going on in the economy and in her life, she wants to rework her line and offerings. She will make announcements soon. " Hmmm... so is the line kaput? No way, says Conrad's rep. She continues, " She is taking a hiatus, but the line still exists and will continue. The sales of her line in the first year doubled what was projected. However, in light of the economy, it's a good time for Lauren to take a few seasons off to re-work her still budding line. She will look over the past seasons to determine what worked and what didn't work so that she may design clothing that will appeal to her fans. " What do you think - is it a good idea for Lauren to reinterpret her Collection? Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 04 2009 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted making her way into Eva Longoria's restaurant, Beso, for a night of filming her hit reality show "The Hills" in Hollywood on March 4. I know many of you readers think that Lauren consistently plays it safe with her style and never takes any chances - do you feel the same way about this outfit? LC started with a patterned blouse (check out similar options from Walter, like the Neon Watercolor Print Blouse , or from Cake Couture, like the Silk Wrap Blouse in Mix ) and paired it with skinny black denim (try Tag Jeans' Stretch Skinny Pant in Black ) and black suede Louboutins. Her finishing touches? Her favorite gold charm necklace (like Maya Brenner Designs' The Everything Necklace in Gold ), a large silver ring (check out Michele Michel Jewelry's Adjustable Hammered Dome Ring in Silver ), and her good old trusty black quilted Chanel. As I'm sure you already know, the upcoming Season 5 of "The Hills" will be the shows last, and executive producer Liz Gately is speaking out about Lauren's decision to call it quits. She says, " Fans first fell in love with Lauren when she was just 17 years old and a high school senior in Laguna Beach. For the five years that followed, Lauren allowed MTV to follow every aspect of her incredible journey in life. We watched her grow into an adult on Â&lsquo;The Hills,Â&rsquo; from her first real love to finding a career in fashion to difficult times when friendships unraveled. It is bittersweet, but I understand why she is saying goodbye. " What do you think - will you be tuning in to this final season? Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 24 2009 in Beverly Hills, CA. Lauren Conrad and BFF Lo Bosworth were spotted indulging in some retail therapy on February 24 at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills following a lunch at Crustacean Beverly Hills with ex-roomie Audrina Patridge, where they filmed for the upcoming Season 5 of their popular reality show. In similar outfits, Lauren chose to tuck a navy cami (like Autumn Cashmere's Racer Back Tank in Peacot , a navy-ish shade) into a full skirt (similar to Gold Hawk's Embroidered Skirt in Excalibur Grey ) and pair with black suede Loubs and a decorative gold necklace (try Calico Juno Designs' Necklace 85 in Gold ). Lo, on the other hand, chose a black tank (check out Burning Torch's Ghost Tank in Black ) tucked into a colorful patterned mini (take a peek at Misile's Astor Row Skirt in Animal Print ), with a Chanel bag and black flats. Has anyone else noticed that whenever these two hit the town, they tend to wear very similar outfits? I wonder if they plan this or if it's subconscious? While the girls are currently filming Season 5, Lauren recently announced that this will be the shows last. She tells Seventeen Magazine ," My biggest thing with the show was that I wanted to walk away from it while it's still a great thing. I always want to remember it that way. I gave MTV a deadline and said, 'This is as long as I can do it and stay sane.' " Of her rumored beau Kyle Howard, Lauren says, " He's a friend. I'm a fan of labels, but 'girlfriend' doesn't always look good on me. Ha! " Interesting! Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 22 2009 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted working the red carpet of the 10th Annual Academy Awards Celebration Dinner and After-Party benefiting Children Uniting Nations in Los Angeles last night, February 22, sporting a new bang-heavy hairdo. For Lauren's post-Oscars look, she chose a greyish-black sequined mini dress (check out LaROK's Serengeti Tunic in Black Zebra ) with a pair of black tights and black suede Christian Louboutin heels. Accessory wise, she snagged an embellished black clutch (try Linea Pelle Collection's LC Clutch in Black , which Lauren actually helped design!) and kept her jewelry minimal, wearing the delicate charm necklace that she never leaves home without, silver drop studs (try Rachel Leigh's Estelle Stud Earrings in Silver ) and a simple pretty bracelet (take a peek at Amy DiGregorio's Assonet Bay Bracelet in Rose Quartz ). For those of you "Hills" fans out there, PerezHilton.com is reporting that new (and final) episodes of the reality show will begin on MTV next month. You won't see Lauren's boyfriend, Kyle Howard, featured on these new eps, as producer Liz Gateley says, " Kyle is not essential to the season's narrative. The new episodes really focus on tying up relationships of the past. " Relationships of the past? Lauren and Heidi? Lo and Audrina? Spencer and Lauren??? I wonder which past relationships she's referring to - and will you be watching? Lauren Conrad seen on Jan 15 2009 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted filming "The Hills" at hotspot Beso in Hollywood alongside Lo Bosworth and Audrina Patridge on January 15, keeping her look simple with a classic combination of black and white. Lauren started with a white silk dress (check out Shumaq's Fiona Dress in White or Prairie New York's more detailed Satin Ballerina Dress in Snow for similar options), and paired with black tights, patent leather pumps, and her favorite Chanel bag. Lauren finished her look off with a few key accessories, like an oversized gold pendant (similar to Rachel Leigh's Heart Statement Necklace in Peach ) and a few delicate gold bangles. Yet another Lauren look that doesn't take any chances, but keeping it simple and not looking like she's trying too hard is part of her charm, don't you think? In other Lauren news, it sure seems like everyone has an opinion on "The Hills," doesn't it? Teen actress Emma Roberts is speaking out about her thoughts on the show, saying, " 'The Hills' I donÂ&rsquo;t really understand because I think everyone knows it is fake except for LC, because she is the only one crying in every episode. I feel bad IÂ&rsquo;m like, Â&lsquo;She is always crying and no one else is. Maybe she doesnÂ&rsquo;t know itÂ&rsquo;s fake. '" What are your thoughts - do you agree with Emma's sentiments? Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 22 2008 in New York, NY. "Hills" stars Audrina Patridge , Lauren Conrad , and Whitney Port posed on the red carpet of "The Hills" Season 4 Finale Party at Tavern on the Green in NYC on December 22, each rocking their own individual style. Audrina paired a deep red, floor length chiffon frock (Plenty by Tracey Reese's Maxi Slip Dress in Red is a more casual, patterned version) with a cuff and casual waves, while Lauren chose a nude colored, beaded mini (check out LaROK's similar Cup de Jour Dress in Nude ) with a shorter, wavy 'do and Louboutin stilettos. Whitney, the fashion risk-taker of the bunch, paired a long, deep purple dress (Ingwa Malermo's Elena Charmeuse Maxi Dress in Aubergine is similar, or for a shorter style, take a look at Cleo Brands' One Shoulder Dress in Purple ) with neon pink flats and a headband that can only be described as a reject from the Renaissance fair. What was Whit thinking with that thing? But what do you think, which girl got it right with their look (and do you like Whitney's crazy headband)? Film.com has named Lauren (and her outfit) as their look of the week, saying, " Lauren Conrad showed up at The Hills finale after party in New York City wearing a festive frock. Her sequined Philip Lim confetti dress and pewter Christian Louboutins proved to be a perfect holiday look, and the thin gold bangle and retro curls were a fine finish. While the looks of the other Hills' cast members fell flat, Lauren lit up the red carpet. " Do you agree with them, CoutureCandy readers? Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 18 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad made an appearance at the Grand Opening of the D&G; Flagship Boutique in Los Angeles on December 18, going for an all-black look accented by the nail-trend-du-jour, slate grey nails. For a frock similar to Lauren's, check out Zoa's Twist Ruffle Front Tunic Dress in Black or Ella Moss' funky Ivy Embroidered Dress in Black , and then slip into a pair of black tights and a shiny pair of black heels. For the finishing touches, Lauren accessorized with a feminine bow in her hair, her favorite "Lauren" double finger ring (check out Erica Anenberg's Double Finger Ring in Sterling Silver ) and another gold ring on her other finger (CC Skye's Malibu Stud Ring in Gold is great). What do you think of Lauren's look here? Basic, yes... but chic? Yes! For those "Hills" fans out there, I'm sure you are looking forward to the finale tonight and whether the Heidi and Lauren reunion will finally be televised. Heidi called into Ryan Seacrest's radio show earlier this morning, saying, " Lauren and I have both had a lot thatÂ&rsquo;s happened in our lives and I think that weÂ&rsquo;re older now. For me personally, IÂ&rsquo;ve missed herÂ&mdash; that was my best friend and itÂ&rsquo;s hard when thatÂ&rsquo;s taken out of your life. I think for both of us we kind of just want some kind of closure in one way or another. It was really, really good to see her. It was definitely one of my best moments of this season. " Now that the girls have finally buried the hatchet, do you think they'll ever truly be best friends again? Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 10 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad and best galpal Lo Bosworth were spotted grabbing breakfast (and filming "The Hills," of course) at MiraÂ&rsquo;Le in West Hollywood on December 10, and it seems these BFFs have taken their similarities to the next level. Ignore the flowing blonde locks and almost identical denim- these two even wear their scarves tied the same way. Sheesh! For Lauren's look, start with a dark pair of super skinnies (like Desert Blue's The Phoenix Skinny Jean in Navy ) and pair with a thin black tee (like Qi's V Underslip Top in Black ) and a black blazer (check out Signorelli's Logo Blazer in Black ), and accessorize with round sunnies, a while scarf, and glittery heels. Lauren also seems to have gone back to her favorite classic red nailpolish for the holiday season. For Lo's look, start with a killer leather motorcycle jacket (check out Gold Hawk's Ribbed Motorcycle Jacket in Black ), and pair with a long olive green scarf, skinny denim with a grey-ish blue wash (The ProportionofBlu's Uno Skinny Jean in Indigo are great) and tall camel boots with patent accents. Who do you think is rocking their (very similar) look better, though- Lauren or Lo? In other Lauren news, it seems that she still cares for Heidi Montag- or at least that's what she wants the public to believe. Heidi's sister, Holly, told Us Weekly that after hearing about Heidi and Spencer's surprise wedding in Mexico, " Lauren called to check on everybody and make sure the family was OK. " So what I really want to know is, when are Lauren and Heidi going to make their public reunion? Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 10 2008 in Sylmar, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted out in Sylmar, CA (which is in the San Fernando Valley) on Monday, November 10, heading into the warehouse that she uses for her clothing line. After paying a visit to the warehouse, Lauren zoomed away in her Audi R8 to lunch at the Sunset Marquis Hotel, changing up her glasses look from the practical (wearing square prescription glasses) to trendy (wearing oversized black shades, like Nour's Noushi Sunglasses in Crystal Mystery ). For the rest of her casual outfit, Lauren paired a cozy looking grey sweater (check out Autumn Cashmere's Button Back Cable Sweater in Cement or Qi's Terry Scoop Neck Top in Granite for similar looks) with super skinny cuffed denim (like Desert Blue's The Phoenix Skinny Jean in Soft Wash ), a long pearl necklace (check out Brian Nagourney Jewelry's Long Pearl Loops Necklace ) and her go-to black Chanel bag. Finishing touch? Why, a pair of peeptoe Loubs of course. What do you think of this look on Lauren- hit or miss? There's no doubt that she's playing it safe, but then again, that's always been her thing! While Perez Hilton recently reported that Lauren threw a conniption fit while at JFK airport in NYC when an airport employee called her name on the loudspeaker, Lauren is taking to her Myspace blog to clear up the most recent rumors. It's always something with this girl! Conrad says, " Apparently they are reporting that someone watched me throw a fit and start crying because they called my name over the speaker at JFK...Really? While it is a very entertaining story, I just donÂ&rsquo;t think that highly of myself. Â&rdquo; See, she's just a regular girl! Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 27 2008 in New York, NY. Lauren Conrad was spotted heading into the Ed Sullivan Theatre to film a segment for "The Late Show with David Letterman" in NYC on October 27, followed by a date with her new main squeeze, Kyle Howard, at The Buddakan Restaurant later that evening. To snag Lauren's look, start with a cute cropped leather jacket, like Gold Hawk's Belted Leather Jacket in Moonless Night , over a ruffled white blouse (check out Gold Hawk's Sleeveless Solid Ruffle Top in White Essence ) and tucked into ultra wide leg trousers (like Lotta Stensson's Linen Palazzo Pant in Black ). Accessory wise, Lauren grabbed her trademark small Chanel bag, a gold coin necklace (similar to Maya Brenner Designs' Santorini Coin Necklace ), and the studded belt that Sarah Jessica Parker made famous when she wore it playing Carrie Bradshaw in the Sex and the City Movie (for an equally awesome studded belt, check out Rough Roses' Multi Studded Belt in Black ). Conrad then finished her look off with those flowing, wavy locks of hers. What do you think of Lauren's look- love it or lose it? A few days later, Lauren was back in LA to hit up the Pur Jeans Halloween event held at STK and Coco Deville, rocking a flapper costume, complete with a fringe dress and feathers in her hair. She told one interviewer that she is a flapper ever year, but changes her dress and the costume a little every time. The interviewer then said that "is lame!" What do you think- is Lauren's repetitive costume lame or loveable? Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 15 2008 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted grabbing a bite to eat at Katsuya Hollywood on October 15, in an ensemble that I'm trying to wrap my mind around. Part of me likes it, but the other part is thinking, "what's goin' on, girl??" Separately, I like the studded Louboutins and the studded bag (for a similar chain bag, check out Julie K Handbags' Gigi Mini Bag in Azure ), but together, I think the studs just clash and don't work well together. Then, Lauren paired a very Blair Waldorf-esque headband with a white top (similar to 3J Workshop Sara Top in White Metallic ) and black leggings (like Laura Dahl's Tiny Dancers Leggings in Black ), and I think the top is just a tad bit too short with the leggings. In theory, this outfit was a good one, but I think there was just something off in the execution. Oh well, you can't win 'em all, and at least Lauren wasn't wearing another plain jersey dress from her collection! While some of you may have heard about Lauren and frenemy Heidi Montag's reunion at STK, former "Hills" castmember Brian Droulet is speaking out, and said, " I know for a fact Lauren will never really become friends with Heidi again, because Lauren is a genuine, awesome person. We all went through Heidi's transformation as a group, and we know the reunion of their friendship ain't happenin'. " What do you think- do you want to see Lauren and Heidi's superpowers reunite? Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 05 2008 in Beverly Hills, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted out in Beverly Hills yesterday, October 5, with her dad, telling the paparazzi how she felt without uttering one word. Wrapped up in a drama tornado at the moment, due to ex-BFF Audrina Patridge's belief that she hooked up with Justin Bobby, Lauren made a statement with her tee, which read "You Can't Break My Spirit." For a similar look, nab Hank Vintage Threads' Give Peace A Chance Tank in Carribean , and pair with super skinny jeans, like Desert Blue's The Phoenix Skinny Jean in Soft Wash . Lauren finished off her look with black satin ballet flats and a white Balenciaga bag (Lesa Wallace Handbags' Vegetable Tan Ricky Bag in Moon is a more affordable version). What do you think- do you agree that the media are coming down on Lauren so hard for something she probably didn't do? Lauren took to her Myspace page to address Audrina, saying, " We promised we wouldnÂ&rsquo;t let people get into our ears and make us fight. You KNOW I didnÂ&rsquo;t do this and I have never given you a reason not to trust me. What you are doing is hurtful and I donÂ&rsquo;t want to fight with you. Whoever is telling you these things does not have your best interest at heart. I have always been there for you and now IÂ&rsquo;m being attacked for something I didnÂ&rsquo;t do. We are supposed to be there for each other when other people do this to us and today you are the one doing it to me. Today you are the reason people are saying mean things about me. You asked me if I did this and I told you I didnÂ&rsquo;t. " I for one HIGHLY doubt she would hook up with Justin- every time Lauren mentions him on the show she is basically making fun of him. What are your thoughts? Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 21 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was seen posing on the red carpet of the 2008 Primetime Emmy Awards earlier tonight, September 21, held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles. Sporting a floor length, midnight blue gown of her own design (check out Holly's Maxi Long Dress in Purple and Lotta Stensson's Long Gathered Tube Dress in Black for similar silhouettes) with a decorative pin and a simple diamond bracelet (take a look at Femme Metale's similar Royal Crest Bracelet ), Lauren kept her hair messily swept up as she has been at many of the recent events she has attended. Thoughts on the dress? We all know Lauren's line is simple and very, very basic- but do you think this design and color are Emmy appropriate? I think the girl looks beautiful, and simple as she may be, really can do no fashion wrong. Just my two cents! In other news in the world of Conrad, it seems that Audrina has finally moved out of the house she used to share with LC and Lo Bosworth. The girls were spotted moving Audrina's things out into a moving van, all in front of "The Hills" cameras, of course. No word on where Audrina is headed, maybe in with Justin Bobby? Thoughts?? Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 07 2008 in Hollywood, CA. MTV darling Lauren Conrad was spotted posing on the red carpet of the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards at Paramount Pictures Studios on September 7, looking pretty and sunkissed. In a mini bubble dress by Pogah Couture (for more casual options, check out Ecoganik's Empire Waist Bubble Dress in White or Tricia Fix's Lucy Mini Dress in White ) and metallic silver heels, LC's look was all about the silver and white, as she accessorized with a silver clutch (similar to Linea Pelle's Hayley Clutch in Silver ) and oodles of silver bracelets and bangles (check out Jennifer Zuener Jewelry's dainty Rope Chain Bracelet with Mini Pendant in Silver and Femme Metale Jewelry's Royal Crest Bracelet in Silver ). Add a loose, beachy updo as a finishing touch and, voila! VMA red carpet ready. For all of you "Hills" fans out there, what are your thoughts on last night's tearful episode? Lauren and Audrina finally had their big "friendship talk," in which Lauren said, " IÂ&rsquo;m not mad at you. I donÂ&rsquo;t have bad feelings. I am just hurt. I feel like I am trying so hard to be friends with someone who just doesnÂ&rsquo;t have any interest in being my friend. The worst part at the end of the day is that you were one of my best friends and I feel like I have completely lost that. IÂ&rsquo;ve lost another friend. I am so tired of trying to make you be my friend. I feel pathetic. " All in all though, the girls decided to let the past be the past and tearfully hugged as they vowed to move forward in getting their BFF-ness back. What do you think- are Audrina and Lauren finally out of their dramatic slump, or will there be, in typical "Hills" fashion, more drama between these two besties? Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 04 2008 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted at Nylon Magazine's TV Issue Event featuring "90210" last night, September 4, at Tropicana Bar at the Roosevelt Hotel, sporting longer, wavier locks and the same exact dress in a different color that Shannen Doherty wore last night (gasp!). For a similar silky frock, check out Parameter's Henley Tunic in Dark Seagreen and Mini Dress in Navy , or LaROK's vibrantly patterned Tiva Dress in Multi . Lauren accessorized her look with a black belt around her waist (I love Linea Pelle's Waist Belt with Leather Covered Studs ), a David Yurman ring and red bracelets (check out Accessories & Beyond's Good Luck Bracelet in Burgundy ). Loving the YSL heels, too! In other Lauren news, it seems that "The Hills" starlet is very excited about this year's VMA's. She says, " IÂ&rsquo;m going and IÂ&rsquo;m presenting and IÂ&rsquo;m really excited. I just got my dress today. " When asked who she was most excited to see, she said, " Michael Jackson! When do you get to see that? " Very true! Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 24 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad got her pigtail on as she hit up a West Hollywood Whole Foods on August 24 for groceries and fresh flowers for her home that she shares with Audrina Patridge and Lo Bosworth. My thoughts on the hair? Super cute! For her outfit, Lauren paired a tank dress (check out similar silhouette's from Qi, like Tank Dress in Arctic White , and Autumn Cashmere, like the luxurious Flower Babydoll Dress in Black Winter ) with black sandals (like Matiko Footwear's Katia Sandal in Black ) and square sunglasses (check out JeeVice Optics' Red Hot Sunglasses in Brown Fade ). And I must mention that Lauren had a security escort with her at Whole Foods the whole time, just to be safe. You know you've hit the big time when you need a personal security guard! While many people criticize Lauren's clothing line for being too plain and say that she probably doesn't even design the line at all, Lauren is speaking out about how she feels about the current state of her line. She says, " I will probably never have the respect I want in the fashion industry, but I can work hard every day to try and prove myself ." Do you agree that Conrad will probably never be taken seriously and respected as a designer, or do you think that as she matures, so will her line? Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 13 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. "Hills" starlet Lauren Conrad was photographed out and about in West Hollywood on August 13, carrying along a can of Diet Coke and her trademark quilted Chanel. In a plain and pretty outfit, Lauren started her look with a high-waisted mini skirt (like Parameter's High Waist Mini Skirt in Black ) and paired with a plain black tank (similar to P.G.D. Style's Fancy Tank in Black - third sighting in a row for the Fancy Tank!), a 3/4 sleeve cream colored cardigan (check out Sydney Los Angeles' 3/4 Sleeve Cardigan in Vanilla Cream ) and ballet flats with bows. Accessory wise, Conrad picked a pair of tortoise shades (similar to Nour's Maadar Sunglasses in Oro ), her red Hamsa hand bracelet, a few dainty necklaces and some bangles (I love Amrita Singh's Beaded Bangle Set in White ). As I'm sure you're aware, the 4th (and probably final) season of "The Hills" premieres on Monday, and Lauren is already speaking out about her love life (or lack thereof) on the show. Rumors have spread that she is dating "My Boys" star Kyle Howard, although Lauren has denied this and claims that they're just friends. Of her love life, though, she says, " My love life is an absolute trainwreck. And half of my friends are guysÂ&hellip; ItÂ&rsquo;s kind of embarrassing, because youÂ&rsquo;re out with a group of friends and the next day it says youÂ&rsquo;re dating one of them and lap dancing, too. You have to say, Â&lsquo;You know, IÂ&rsquo;m sorry, but that kind of comes with the territory.Â&rsquo;. " Okay, I have to ask- how many of you are excited for the season 4 premiere? Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 07 2008 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted leaving the EA SportsÂ&rsquo; Madden NFL Football Game Event on August 7 in Hollywood, sporting the hairbraid that she has grown so fond of lately. For her look, Lauren started with an embellished blue top (check out Whitley's Jessica Top in Navy ), and paired it with black leggings (like Laura Dahl's Fancy Dancers Leggings in Noir ), her Chanel bag, and multiple bangles (similar to Mickey Lynn Designs' Set of 3 Hammered Bracelets in Silver and Rachel Leigh's Audrey Python Bangle in Black ). While Lauren's clothing line is either love-or-hate, it seems that the powers that be at the Emmy Awards seem to love it. Conrad confirmed that she will be designing one or two dresses for the onstage tropy girls, saying, " It's a huge compliment. IÂ&rsquo;m doing one. I may be doing two. ItÂ&rsquo;s a huge compliment to be asked to do that, and it was really amazing to be taken seriously. " Regarding the rumors that Lauren doesn't have any part in designing her line, she commented, saying, " I didnÂ&rsquo;t even really respond to the rumors because they were so silly. It was someone who knew how important the line is to me and knew that that would hurt me. " I guess that shows all the people that doubted her design ability... not just anyone gets asked to design gowns for the Emmy's! Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 03 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad struck her signature hands-on-hips pose on the blue carpet of the 2008 Teen Choice Awards in LA last night, August 3, wearing a custom-made dress from her line, the Lauren Conrad Collection, for the night. Holly's Halter Color Block Dress in Multi and Tricia Fix's Renta Long Velvet Dress in Sage are two interestingly patterned long dresses, if you are interested in partaking in the maxi-dress trend that seems to be sweeping Hollywood lately. For the rest of her outfit, Lauren paired multiple gold charm necklaces (like Maya Brenner Designs' The Charm-ing Necklace in Gold ) with a skinny belt (similar to Jack Rabbit Collection's Tale of Two Buckles Belt in Cognac ) and her "LAUREN" ring. Delicious! Now I have to wonder- what shoes was Ms. Conrad wearing? Since her dress is so long, she might have been wearing Uggs under there and all of us are none the wiser. I would totally do that if I was famous. Lauren scooped up the Choice TV Female Reality/Variety Star Award, and her show nabbed the Choice TV Celebrity Reality Award at the awards. Agree, disagree? In other Lauren news, it seems that she might have a new boy for the summer. Rumors are circulating that Conrad is getting quite cozy with actor Kyle Howard (he does somewhat resemble her ex, Jason Wahler), but when Lauren was asked if she was seeing Kyle, she replied, " I'm just dating. I'm single and having fun. " This is not what other sources are saying, as one source who was at the Project Beach House at the same time as Lauren told press, " They were almost on top of each other ." Ah, summer love! Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 02 2008 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad and BFF Lo Bosworth were spotted at the The Do Something Awards: The Pre-Party of The Teen Choice Awards at Level 3 in Hollywood on Saturday, August 2, posing stomach-to-stomach as always. For a look similar to Lauren's, check out simple strapless dresses like Shumaq's Emily Strapless Wool Dress in Beige or Sine's Marilyn Dress in White and pair with a skinny black belt (like Jack Rabbit Collection's Bullet Belt in Black ) and delicate gold bangles (similar to Rebecca Norman Jewelry's Five Assorted Gem Stone Bangles in Vermeil ). If you are inspired by Lo's exotic ikat frock, Tricia Fix's Aubrey Mini Dress in Orange Medallion has a similar, vibrant pattern, and Prarie New York's Rosette Cocktail Dress in Tomato ) has a similar silhouette. Pretty! In other Lauren news, it seems that Doug Reinhardt, the boy that Lauren went on a few dates with a few months back and filmed for "The Hills," is kissing and telling (shocker). Doug told E! Online that he and Lauren were " fairly serious ," and that Lauren was a " good kisser ." Ah, nothing like people capitalizing on others' fame to try and get into the press! Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 28 2008 in Hollywood, CA. Along with Mischa Barton, Lauren Conrad was also spotted out at Key Club in Hollywood last night, July 28, not looking to pleased to see the lingering paps. In a sleek black ensemble with vivid pops of color, Lauren made a haste exit from the club and hopped into a waiting car. To get Conrad's outfit, start with a sexy black cami, like Beau Soleil's Beau Tini Top in Midnight , and pair with an eye-catching lightweight scarf (check out Elizabeth Gillett Ltd's iridescent Delphina Shawl in Black ) and an armful of bangles (check out Christie Martin Jewelry's Disc and Tag Bracelet in Sterling Silver ). Finishing off her look with a pair of latex leggings (check out Wifebeader's adorable Pearl Dancers Leggings in Black ) with Louboutins and a fuschia Balenciaga bag, Lauren looked ready to dance the night away. And it seems that Lauren may have needed this night out, as Star Magazine is reporting this week that Lauren recently broke down in tears in her Hollywood Hills home and that her everpresent smile is masking a deep sadness within. A source says, " She's an emotional train wreck. She usually doesn't lose it like that. But her life has spiraled out of control, and once she opened the floodgates, it was all over. She just crumpled, putting her head in her hands and sobbed ." Poor Lauren, I hope that's not true! I do understand why she might be reduced to tears, however; in the past week alone, she has been accused of not designing her clothing line (which was dropped by Kitson) and rumors spread that she was a major diva at a charity event, in addition to the constant "Lauren is fighting with Audrina" rumors that are out there. Poor thing- this is definitely the time to show your support for "The Hills" starlet! Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 20 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. "Hills" hottie Lauren Conrad was spotted returning to LAX from her trip to New York on July 20, sporting a souvenir hoodie she obviously picked up while hosting the Svedka Vodka party at Lily Pond in East Hampton. For a similar look, check out Qi's Terry Pullover Hoodie in Orchid . For the rest of her airport-friendly look, Lauren slipped into a pair of dark denim (like Desert Blue's The Phoenix Skinny Jean in Navy ) and accessorized with a fuschia Balenciaga bag, black shades (Nour's Baba Sunglasses in Oro Bianco are similar) and gold sandals (check out Matiko Footwear's Oda Flat in Gold ). While Lauren's clothing line has always received a mixed reception, it seems that Kitson decided to drop the axe on the Lauren Conrad Collection. Kitson store owner Fraser Ross says, " Initially sales were great but they became lackluster. They need to realize it's no different than selling your album, your TV shows, your movies. You have to keep promoting it ." Hey, Lauren's a busy girl! Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 11 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad attended the Intermix Celebrates VH1 Rock Honors Event in LA on July 11, working her signature legs-crossed arms-on-hips red carpet pose. Wearing an embellished black dress (check out similar offerings from LaROK, like their Navajo Chain Dress in Black or their Rock n Roll Dress in Black ) with a Chanel bag, peeptoe Loubs and a long gold necklace (like Lana Jewelry's Petite Solar Necklace in Gold ), Lauren let her golden tan and playfully pulled back hair take center stage. Rumors recently circulated on PerezHilton.com that Audrina moved out of the home she shared with Lauren and Lo Bosworth on Friday, but this is not the case, according to Audrina herself. She tells Us Weekly, "I wasnÂ&rsquo;t even there today! I have been gone all day. I still havenÂ&rsquo;t even been home. There are rumors all the time, I just laugh at it! " If not Friday, do you think that A.Pat will be moving out anytime soon? Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 02 2008 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad and a few of her galpals (including Lo Bosworth) were spotted hitting up the Hollywood club scene on July 2, first stopping at Crown Bar before bopping over to Coco DeVille, where the girls were seen leaving with Nicky Hilton and her crew. Such is the life of the "Hills" girls! Lauren kept it simple and sophisticated for her night out, starting with a delicate white cami (like Whitley's embroidered Emily Cami in Cream ) tucked into a pair of black silk shorts (check out Sine's Cuff Shorts in Black ), and paired with her black Loubs and all of her dainty jewelry (like simple gold necklaces and sparkly bangles). The finishing touch was her white snake clutch, just like Posse New York's Sama Clutch in White Pearl . In an interview in the new issue of LA Direct magazine, Conrad speaks out about the dichotomy of her real self and her television self. She says, " I feel like [the show] makes me look like I sit around all day and feel sorry for myself, but I'm actually a very happy person. Sometimes I want to reach into the TV and smack myself, and say 'get over it.' " She continues, " It's been a crazy four years, but they've been amazing. I got to travel all over the world. I've met so many cool people. I've had all these opportunities. I'm really lucky. You've got to take the good with the bad. " It's nice to hear that she sounds like she's still down to earth and not letting this all go to her head! Lauren Conrad seen on Jun 19 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted by photogs texting away while spending the day running errands with galpal Lo Bosworth in LA on June 19, putting her hair up in a cute curled ponytail. Lauren started her casual look with a ruffled top (check out Gold Hawk's Sleeveless Solid Ruffle Top in Soft Praline or Zoa's Polka Dot Ruffle Blouse in Coffee for similar options ) and skinny dark denim (like Joe's Jeans' Cigarette Super Slim Jean in Kennedy ), paired with t-strap sandals and Chloe shades. Lauren finished off her look with layered necklaces and tons of gold bracelets (similar to Rebecca Norman Jewelry's Wavy Thin Bangles in Vermeil ). Cute and simple! In related news, Lo recently graduated from UCLA, and all of "The Hills" girls (including Lauren, Audrina and Stephanie Pratt) helped her celebrate with a dinner out at Hollywood hotspot Kumo followed by bottle service at Green Door. A source said, " They all seemed to get along fine. At the beginning of dinner Audrina was a little out of it but she settled in and all the girls were talking together, having a fun time. Still, everyone was having a good time with each otherÂ&hellip; things didnÂ&rsquo;t seem weird. " I guess the tension between Aud and LoBo has finally calmed down? Lauren Conrad seen on Jun 07 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted out and about in LA on June 7, first stopping at a hair salon, and then doing some shopping at Urban Outfitters on Melrose with her friend Jill. Lauren spiced up her ordinary outfit with an exotic printed scarf, the perfect touch to her white cami (Yoana Baraschi's Heirloom Mesh Bow Cami in Ivory is a flirty choice) and black skinnies (like Denim of Virtue's Patience 5 Pocket Tapered Jean in Black ) combo. Conrad accessorized with a pair of large shades (similar to Nour's Noushi Sunglasses in Crystal Mystery ), a Chanel bag and an armful of bangles. It seems that tension is growing high in the house that Lauren shares with "Hills" costars Lo Bosworth and Audrina Patridge, so much so that sources say Audrina might be moving out. A source tells Page Six, "She (Audrina) hasnÂ&rsquo;t officially moved out yet, but she stays with different people. ItÂ&rsquo;s grown so bad between them she doesnÂ&rsquo;t want to be there. If her star starts to burn brighter than LaurenÂ&rsquo;s, thereÂ&rsquo;s going to be trouble. " So what do you think, is Audrina the new Heidi? Lauren Conrad seen on May 30 2008 in Las Vegas, NV. Lauren Conrad and Lo Bosworth were spotted posing on the red carpet of the grand opening of the Palms Place Hotel & Spa in Las Vegas, NV on May 30, and I must say... "The Hills" starlets are starting to look so much alike lately I might confuse them for twins if I didn't know any better! Lauren stuck to a classy LBD (like Guy Baxter's Bari Dress in Black ) and Loubs, while Lo paired a teal tank (like Zoa's Double Braided Neckline Top ) with a high-waisted black mini (Parameter's High Waist Mini Skirt in Black is similar) and chunky black heels. The night before, the girls (including Audrina!) celebrated pal Frankie Delgado's birthday at Cut and then headed over to LAX for a night of drinking and dancing. Oh, to be young and on a reality show! With all of this jetsetting, one might think that this perky pair would just want to take a night or two off... but then again, when they get paid to party, I can understand why they make so many personal event appearances! What do you think- when will Lauren Conrad, et al.'s 15 finally be up? Or will it ever? Lauren Conrad seen on May 22 2008 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was snapped leaving Hollywood hotspot du jour Crown Bar with ex-beau Stephen Colletti on May 22, looking classic in a form-fitting white dress (Sine's Marilyn Dress in White comes with an adorable- and detachable- bronze braided belt). The rest of her outfit was all in the accessorized, as Lauren carried a snakeskin clutch (like Posse New York's Sama Clutch in White Pearl ) and wore multiple gold necklaces (check out Erica Anenberg's Charm Necklace in Gold ) and bangles. While we all know that Audrina Patridge has been caught in the middle of Lauren and Heidi Montag's WW3, she played both sides of the field as she planned her birthday party a while back. A source says," Lauren threw Audrina a bash at the house they share. She wanted to do something special for her because they had a rough year. But the next night, Audrina partied with Heidi Montag! Audrina's parents put together an invitation-only, casino-themed party for her at their Orange County home, and Audrina really wanted Heidi to be there, since the girls have become close again. " Way to avoid an awkward run in, Aud! Lauren Conrad seen on May 13 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted by shutterbugs (and doesn't seem to be too happy about it) leaving STK restaurant in West Hollywood on May 13, and don't you just love that big arm and hand coming from outside the image totally telling everyone to back up! Lauren stepped out for the night in a vibrant blue dress, presumably from the Lauren Conrad Collection, although Prarie New York's Strapless Silk Dress in Cobalt is similar, and has added crystal detailing at the bust. Lauren accessorized her look with a python clutch (similar to Julie K Handbags' Envie Python Clutch in Yellow Python ), gold bangles, a silver pendant necklace (check out Jessica Elliot's Diamond Istanbul Pendant Necklace in Silver ), and yet another variation on her hairstyle du jour, the braid. While "The Hills" had its season finale last week, the world is abuzz over the fact that not all is well in Lauren's West Hollywood paradise. Fans are now taking sides- Team Audrina VS. Team Lo, due to the fact that the show is painting the picture that Lo (Lauren's friend of 12 years) is coming in between Lauren and Audrina's friendship. I am totally Team Lo, as these two have been friends forever and have a real connection, in addition to the fact that they have constantly tried to include slash reach out to Aud, but that is just my two cents. Whose team are YOU on? Lauren Conrad seen on May 06 2008 in New York, NY. Lauren Conrad is the latest celeb to head to New York, and was spotted here arriving in NYC on May 6. I just realized that Lauren's style is very similar to Rachel Bilson's; casual and yet always very put together. Lauren started her "jeans and tee" look with a white tee (check out Los Angeles Royalty's Bamboo Tee in White ) and (of course) very dark wash denim (similar to Joe's Jeans' Chelsea Jean in Reed ) tucked into black Minnetonka Moccasins. Accessory wise, Lauren kept it pretty basic, sticking to a patterned sheer silk scarf and silver bracelets (like Mickey Lynn Designs' Hammered Bracelet Set in Silver ) and necklaces (check out Maya Brenner Designs' World Peace Necklace in Silver ). As I'm sure you're already aware, tonight is the season finale of season 3 of "The Hills" on MTV, which will also air a pre-show and after-show for their ratings juggernaut. BuddyTV is describing the finale as " Audrina feeling threatened by Lauren Conrad's close friendship with Lo. Feeling shut out by the two, Audrina is bitten by the bug to move out on her own, prompting Lauren to make a heartfelt effort to mend things with her. Finally, Spencer Pratt fears the worst that Heidi will be lost to him for good when he finds out she's accepted a gig in Las Vegas. " Always with the drama! Will you be watching?? Lauren Conrad seen on May 05 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted running errands around LA on May 5, rockin' the gladiator sandals with her easy Spring look. To nab Lauren's style, start with a breezy white tank (like Joe's Jeans' Isley Pleated Top in Bone , which also comes in an awesome teal color) and denim shorts (for an alternative to Lauren's casual cutoffs, check out Tag Jeans' Double Belted Short in Light Wash ). Next up, pile on the gold necklaces and bracelets, and snag a pair of killer square shades (similar to JeeVice Optics' Red Hot Sunglasses in Brown Fade ). Finishing touch? Lauren cheekily wore a leopard print bra under her tank, and if you are heading to the pool and/or beach anytime soon, take a peek at Nina Swimwear's adorable Robbie Bikini in Brown or Tyler Rose's The Jayne Suit in Animal Print . It seems that the testosterone-fueled readers of Maxim think that the fantastically plastic Heidi Montag is hotter than Conrad, as Lauren came in at number 56 in their annual "Hot List", while Heidi came in at number 21. See Heidi, all of that plastic surgery and fake tanning and bleach paid off! Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 30 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was caught by photographers sleeping with the enemy AKA lunching at Urth Caffe in West Hollywood yesterday, April 30, with Stephanie Pratt, sworn enemy Spencer Pratt's sister. If you watch "The Hills," you know that Lauren and Stephanie have become quite chummy lately, leaving resident villainess Heidi Montag confused over why Lauren hates her guts for dating Spencer (umm... vicious sex tape rumors ring any bells?) but hangs out with Spence's blood relatives. So much drama up in "The Hills"! Lauren played it cool with her outfit (and seemingly newly acquired hair extensions), starting with a high-waisted mini (check out Parameter's High Waist Mini Skirt in Black )- very typical of Lauren. Next up, Conrad tucked in a printed tank (take a fashion risk with ZG by Grimaldi's unusual Cami Silk Tunic in Grey Feathers ) to the skirt, and slipped her tootsies into a pair of gold metallic flip flops. Accessory wise, Lauren brought along her black quilted Chanel (a necessity for her), and piled on the bangles and gold necklaces (like Danielle Stevens Jewelry's Angel Wings Necklace in Gold ). Finishing touch: oversized sunnies, like Nour's Minou Sunglasses in Manner Mania . It seems that Lauren's romantic life has been heating up lately, as she has been spotted nonstop over the past week with Doug Reinhardt, who plays for the Baltimore Orioles. In addition to hitting up Hollywood hot spots like Goa, sources say that the hot new pair filmed scenes for the show. I wonder if this one will last? Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 18 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was caught by photogs visiting a friends house in LA on April 18, looking like a little ray of sunshine in her vibrant sundress (from her own line?). For a similar frock, check out Shumaq's Coti Dress in Yellow . Lauren brought along one of her trademark Chanel bags for her day out and about, and further accessorized with a dainty charm necklace (like Maya Brenner Designs' World Peace Necklace in Silver ) and a pair of square framed shades (similar to JeeVice Optics' Red Hot Sunglasses in Brown Fade ). While it is no secret that much of "The Hills" is less than real, Lauren is speaking out about how drawing the line between real life and "reality television" can get a bit hazy. For instance, Conrad is not allowed to talk about what is coming up on the new season, even though media coverage is always heavy surrounding the starlet, and celebrity weeklies can't get enough "Hills" scoop. Lauren says, " We find ourselves in a situation where things are being reported months and months before they show up on the show. Media will report on our everyday lives, but the thing is, our everyday lives is the television show, so it gives away what's going to happen. " What a tangled web Lauren lives! She continues, " That's the way the show's meant to be. It's meant to be an unscripted drama. [The Hills] does not address the celebrity that comes with it, and I probably would not be able to do [the Lauren Conrad Collection] without the celebrity that comes with the show. They chose not to include it and I didn't really want to include it because I try to separate the line and the show. " This conversation is getting pretty deep.. what is your take on the show? Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 07 2008 in Santa Monica, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted lugging some shopping bags around as she left the Viceroy Hotel in Santa Monica, CA on April 7, looking adorable as always in an outfit that is perf for Spring. And look at those toned legs of hers! Those training sessions that she goes to that are always aired on "The Hills" are definitely paying off. Lauren started her look with a white strapless top (check out Vanitas' Strapless Eyelet Top in Cream ) tucked into a high-waisted mini skirt (similar to Parameter's High Waist Mini Skirt in Black ), paired with a dainty cream cardigan (like Sydney Los Angeles' 3/4 Sleeve Cardigan in Vanilla Cream ). Lauren accessorized with her fave Dita shades, the gold flip flops she's taken quite a liking to lately and a classic Chanel bag. It seems that Lauren and arch nemesis Heidi Montag put aside their differences (or were getting enough to get over them for a day) as the two joined forces for a cover shoot for Rolling Stone , their first shoot together in over two years. Guaranteed, the cover will feature both blondes glaring evilly at each other. No doubt about that. What do you think, though- will you be picking up a copy of the mag with Lauren and Heidi gracing the cover? Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 03 2008 in Beverly Hills, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted getting some retail therapy in at Barney's New York in Beverly Hills on April 3, staying true to her beachside roots by slipping her tootsies into a pair of gold flip flops for her shopping excursion. No 5" stilettos during the day for this girl! Lauren also decided on an empire waist off-white dress (similar to Black Halo's Empire Tank Mini Dress in Winter White , or Shumaq's dressier Claire Dress in Metallic Gold ) with her favorite Dite sunglasses (I'm also loving JeeVice Optics' Red Hot Sunglasses , which come in 4 sizzling shades). Lauren also grabbed onto a white leather tote (check out Aaneta's Muddy Large Bag in White ) while she perused the items at Barney's. While enemy and all-around falsity Heidi Montag has openly expressed her support of Presidential candidate John McCain, Lauren has (smartly) decided to stay politically neutral. Lauren's publicist told media, " Lauren Conrad believes in a private ballot but encourages everyone to vote ." Good call Lauren- don't you think? Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 23 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted at LAX heading for NYC on March 23, where she was headed to film the live premier of "The Hills." Going for the casual basics look at the 'port, Lauren started with a casual tee (Rails' Kenna Scoop Tee in Cream is great), and paired with dark wash denim (check out James Jeans' James 5 Pocket Slim Bootcut Jean in Graphite ) and flip flops (always a beach girl at heart). Accessory wise, Conrad lugged along a giant wine-colored bag and went for simple jewelry, like her silver charm necklace (similar to Maya Brenner Designs' Sparkler Necklace in Sterling Silver ). While many people head out to clubs to get away from the stress of their everyday lives or to just cut loose, Lauren is going out (among other reasons, I'm sure) for the paycheck! Allegedly, celebrity talent booker Mike Esterman told E! that Lauren is commanding up to $20,000 a night for an appearance at the hottest clubs. Man, that must be nice! Being walked into a club, given tons and tons of drinks, and a fat $20g paycheck at the end of the night. I'm sure Lauren could get used to that! Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 22 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted doing some shopping at Petco in West Hollywood on March 22, purchasing a doggy carrier to probably bring puppy Chloe along with her on her trip to NYC for "The Hills" premier party. Wearing a navy blue minidress (like Gina Michele's Mercer Dress in Navy ) with gold flip flops, Lauren accessorized her look with a pair of big round black sunglasses (check out Nour's Noushi Sunglasses in Crystal Mystery ), gold bracelets (Jennifer Zeuner Jewelry's Vermeil Peace Rope Bracelet is amazing) and a large tote bag (similar to Posse New York's Pilar Bag in Wine ). While new episodes of "The Hills" begin tonight (who'll be watching??), it seems that LC is fuming mad over US Weekly 's cover this week. Lauren was not "stabbed in the back" like the cover states, and insists " The article itself is a nice one but it follows headlines that, in no way, represent my words or feelings. I do not feel betrayed by Audrina or (Conrad's ex) Brody (Jenner). I love them both and said nothing to contradict this. " Good for Lauren, there's no reason they should get away with publishing lies! Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 14 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted doing some shopping damage on Robertson Blvd. in LA on March 14, looking a little down in the dumps if I do say so. For her 'fit, Lauren paired a high waisted white skirt (check out Walter's Jacquard Skirt in White ) with a girly black cami (like Gold Hawk's Sheer Drape Cami in Raven Black ), and accessorized with her fave Dita shades (go for Nour's classic Noushi Sunglasses in Crystal Mystery ), a quilted Chanel and black satin flats. Why do you think Conrad has such a long face? You think she read New York Magazine 's article titled "Inside the Sad, Bizarre World That Was the Lauren Conrad Show"? Basically the mag tore LC a new one, saying that her collection was boring and "tragique". Keep your chin up Lauren, there is definitely a market out there for your designs, just keep pushin' on! Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 11 2008 in Culver City, CA. Lauren Conrad walked the red carpet of her victorious fashion week debut on March 11 in Culver City, as she received a bouquet of flowers praising the Lauren Conrad Collection's first ever fashion show. Wearing a LBD from her line (Laura Dahl's Victoria Dress in Noir and Prarie New York's Strapless Silk Dress in Black are similar) with satin bow heels and some new hair extensions, LC accessorized with a few key feminine jewelry pieces, like a gold bangle (like Rachel Leigh's Snake Bangle in Gold ) and a gold charm necklace (Maya Brenner Designs' The Charm-ing Necklace in Gold is similar). While the reception of Lauren's collection has been mixed (from raves to well, less than), the show drummed up of course the expected quotient of MTV-related drama. All of Lauren's closest buddies attented, like Whitney, Lo and Audrina, as well as former flame Stephen from "Laguna Beach" and Brody Jenner. Also noticeably present was Kristin Cavallari, Lauren's arch-nemesis back in her LB days. While the clothes were overall pretty vanilla, it's good to see that Lauren's making the most of her reality TV-related fame, and made her way to LA Fashion Week. Congrats! Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 05 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted grabbing a quick bite at Lulu's Cafe in Los Angeles with a girlfriend yesterday, March 5, and was having like the most animated conversation ever! That facial expression really kills me. It's like a mix of suprise, excitement and fear. Amazing. To nab LC's outfit, start with a vest (check out Walter's sleek black version, the Herringbone Vest in Black ) over a black tank (I'm loving Autumn Cashmere's ultra luxurious Racer Back Tank in Black ). Next up are Lauren's red Dita sunglasses (her shades du jour) and her Chanel bag. For the skinny on Lauren's skinny denim, grab Joe's Jeans Cigarette Super Slim Jean in Kennedy ) and pair with a pair of black fringe moccasin boots. In other Conrad news, it seems that there might just be more drama on "The Hills". How is this possible, you ask? Well, Lauren is allegedly planning to write a juicy tell-all complete with scandalous details of her young Hollywood crowd. That means you, Heidi! A source tells OK! Weekly, "A chapter got leaked to Kristin Cavallari. It talks about her Â&lsquo;sleeping around LagunaÂ&rsquo; and stealing Stephen Colletti. Â&rdquo; LC also takes shots at Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton, although LC's rep claims that there is no truth to rumors of Lauren penning a book. Guess we'll have to wait and see. The real question, however, is- would you read it? Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 05 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted at Boulevard Lounge in West Hollywood on March 5 posing with "Hills" galpals Audrina Patridge and Whitney Port , and all of the girls decided to stick with basic black for their night out. While Lauren paired a drapey black top (Lotta Stensson's Best Top in Black is like a tube top version of Lauren's) with mid-calf black leggings (like Laura Dahl's Tiny Dancer Leggings in Noir ) and bright blue suede Christian Louboutins (the exact same pair that arch nemesis Heidi Montag was spotted wearing while shopping at Chanel earlier in the week, FYI) which were the only pop of color in the trio's outfits, Audrina and Whitney decided to stick to all black for their looks. Audrina paired a layered-looking black and white frock with black bangles (check out Accessories & Beyond's Mixed Stones and Gold Metal Leather Bangles ) and basic black heels, while Whitney went for a sort of biker-meets-ballerina look with a leather motorcycle jacket, LBD (like Doucette Duvall's Bonnie Dress in Black ) and ballerina flats (check out Matiko Footwear's Verne Flat in Black ). Lauren, Audrina and other roomie Lo Bosworth held a little housewarming get together for close friends at their new West Hollywood, Spanish-style home on Friday night, and attendees included (of course) the three girls, Whitney, Brody Jenner, Stephen Colleti, and even Justin Bobby. The crew nibbled on catered Mexican food and sipped on cocktails as their girls showed off their new pad and partied out by the pool and firepit. The roomies' new puppy Chloe even made a guest appearance! Just another fabulous night in "The Hills". Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 01 2008 in Beverly Hills, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted frolicking around Beverly Hills on Saturday, March 1. Keeping it casual, Conrad sported her signature simple look. LC began her look with a pair of gold flip flops and paired it with a strapless white cotton long dress (Ella Moss' Corsica Smocked Tube Dress in White is a similar basic). Conrad accessorized her look in a black leather handbag (similar to Linea Pelle's Dylan Large Shoulder Bag in Black ), a gold charm necklace (check out Maya Brenner Designs' Santorini Coin Necklace in Vermeil ) paired with matching gold rings (similar to Jewel By Bear's J'taime Double Ring in Gold ) and a silver charm bracelet (check out Mickey Lynn Designs' Hammered Bangle with Heart and Arrow in Sterling Silver ). Conrad made sure to protect her eyes from the California sun by sporting her favorite pair of Dita shades (check out Nour's Baba Sunglasses in Oro Bianco ). After recently purchasing her new home in the Hollywood Hills, Conrad has become quite the domestic. After recent shopping trips to house ware store Crate & Barrel, Lauren has also invested in a new pup. Lauren's lab/shepherd mix (which she bought with fellow "Hills" pal Lo Bosworth), Chloe, is the latest audition to MTV's "The Hills." Will the dog create any new drama when the show comes back for its fourth season, or will she fit right in the mix? I guess we will just have to wait and see. Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 28 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad and fellow "Hills" cutie Lo Bosworth were spotted out and about on February 28 in Los Angeles, heading to lunch which was of course filmed for the upcoming season of the hit "reality" show. To nab the girls' casual spring style, let's start with Lauren. Wrapping herself up in a lightweight purple top, Lauren paired a tight black tube top (check out Lotta Stensson's interesting Best Top in Black ) with cropped black leggings (like Laura Dahl's Tiny Dancers Leggings in Noir ) and a black Chanel bag. Lo, on the other hand, opted for a long white sundress (take a look at Ella Moss' similar Corsica Smocked Tube Dress in White , or, for a splash of color, check out Ella Moss' Kona Strapless Dress in Guava ) with aviators and orange sandals. For those of you who are eagerly awaiting the return of "The Hills" to MTV, it seems that MTV is giving a sneak peek of what's to come to the loyal fans of the show. We all know that the upcoming eps will feature Lauren and Whitney's trip to Paris, including Lauren meeting drop dead gorg Parisian guys (which I'm sure wasn't set up by MTV at all). And never fear, the new episodes will of course feature Heidi and Spencer, because, really... what would the show be without them? Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 14 2008 in Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was photographed heading into hotspot Goa on February 14 (Valentine's Day) with roomie and BFF Audrina Patridge, who obviously only wanted to have a fun girls night out and be each other's Valentine on this love-it-or-hate-it holiday. Wearing an off the shoulder dress (similar to Gina Michele's Organic Mercer Dress in Maroon ) with a few silver bangles (like Mickey Lynn Designs' Set of 3 Hammered Bracelets in Silver ) and a pair of patent leather heels (Matiko Footwear's Abba Heel in Black are adorable), it seems like Conrad finally upgraded her Chanel bag to a newer model. Hooray, it's about time! In other LC romance news, it seems that she and Brody Jenner have been nothing more than just friends lately. Spotted at LAX nightclub in Las Vegas on February 13, one source said that the two " hugged once, but it looked innocent ," and that they seemed like nothing more than friends. Well that's good, seeing as Brody has a girlfriend! Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 09 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was caught catching up with co-worker and pal Whitney Port over lunch on Saturday, February 9. In her usual casual and never daring style, LC seemed to yet again "dress down" for the occasion. LC began her look with a pair of simple flip flops. As the weather heated up in Los Angeles, LC kept cool in a cotton black summer dress (just like Ecoganik's V Neck Babydoll Dress in Black ) and accessorized with her usual jewelry, sunglasses, and a handbag. Lauren dolled up her neck with a gold medallion style necklace (just like Rachel Leigh's Gold Plated Hammered Pave Pendant Necklace ) with silver bangles (just like Mickey Lynn Designs' Set of 3 Hammered Bracelets in Silver ) and a silver chain style bracelet. In her attempt to look posh, she sported her usual pair of oversized square framed sunglasses (check out Nour's Baby in Oro Bianco ). And of course, her always black quilted black Chanel handbag; the "LC consecutive days with the Chanel" counter is back in action! Current status: day number 490! As we all remember, this bag was given to Lauren 300 years ago by ex-BF Jason Wahler. You would think when she got rid of Jason she would have tossed that bag right away too. I mean, really... how old is that bag? Lauren's calendar has been filled with tons of partying lately; after being spotted all over the place in Scottsdale last weekend for the Superbowl, we were anxious to see whether her and Brody were on again or off again. First hitting up the Playboy party with Audrina and her father, Lauren went on to hit up the Tao beach house where she ran into not only Brody Jenner, but also Kristen CavallariÂ&hellip; drama! LC made sure to make a fast dash from there quickly. What do you have to say about all of this drama, Team Lauren or not? Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 06 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted out and about in Los Angeles on Febraury 6, looking quite confused as to where she is and where she's going (loving the exaggerated shrug!). In an outfit consisting of a long purple sweater with black leggings (like Laura Dahl's Tiny Dancers Leggings in Black ), black shades (check out Nour's Madaar Sunglasses in Oro Bianco ), gold flip flops and a black Linea Pelle bag (similar to Linea Pelle's Dylan Large Shoulder Bag in Black , which also comes in Iron and Mahogany), Lauren kept her casual California style in check. In other LC news, it seems that Lauren's former boss at Teen Vogue , Lisa Love, is speaking out about America's most famous intern. Of how "real" the show is, Love says, " I think why they say all that is because thereÂ&rsquo;s so much editing. They shoot reality and somehow itÂ&rsquo;s changed in the editing room to appeal to things, I donÂ&rsquo;t know. " And of Lauren's debut fashion line, Love doesn't think it's high fashion at all! She says, " I think itÂ&rsquo;s more T-shirt kind of things and jeans, very simple basics ." She's got that right, I mean, Lauren's collection has basic tank tops selling for $65! Eesh! Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 02 2008 in Arizona. Lauren Conrad was photographed at the Playboy Super Saturday Night Party thrown by Hugh Hefner and his "Girls Next Door", Bridget Marquardt, Kendra Wilkinson and HBIC Holly Madison in Arizona on February 2, 2008. Taking a walk on the wild side by wearing a sequined zebra mini (Misile's Venezia Dress in Black and White is a funky take on zebra print, and is similar to Lauren's frock), Lauren accessorized her "ready to party" look with a patent leather black clutch (like Carla Mancini's Clutch with Lock and Chain in Black Patent ) with matching heels and silver bangles on her wrist (similar to Mickey Lynn Designs' Set of 3 Hammered Bracelets in Silver ). This has been quite a busy week for Ms. Conrad, as she celebrated her 22nd birthday with a little pre-bash last week at two LA hotspots, Katsuya and S Bar. Getting her sushi on with girlfriends (and fellow "Hills"-mates) Audrina Patridge, Lo Bosworth and Whitney Port at Katsuya, it seems that the evening did not go as planned for the starlet. According to E Online , Lauren took the celebration a little too far as she spent the majority of the night dealing with the consequences of drinking past her limit in the bathroom. A source says, " Camera crews were set up at S Bar, patiently waiting to film scenes for "The Hills", but the birthday girl was throwing up in the bathroom. They finally just decided to call the whole shoot off due to L.C.'s sickness ." Hang in there girl, everyone has definitely been there. It's all about knowing your limit, though! Lauren Conrad seen on Jan 24 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted getting her shop on at Urban Outfitters on Melrose on January 24, still lugging around her trademark quilted Chanel that will probably be on her arm 'til she kicks the bucket. I'm seriously starting the "LC consecutive days with the Chanel" counter. Current status: day number 489! Wearing a cute and casual outfit consisting of a plaid jacket (check out Johnson's cute cropped version, the Crop Jacket in Wednesday ) over a white tee (like Rails' Kenna Scoop Tee in White ) and skinny black jeans (similar to Denim of Virtue's Patience 5 Pocket Tapered Jean in Black ). Lauren accessorized her look with black shades obviously meant to shield her precious eyes from the paparazzi flashes since it was a cloudy day in LA (take a look at Nour's Baba Sunglasses in Oro Bianco ) and a blue shawl (Elizabeth Gillet's Imelda Shawl in Red is a similar piece in a vibrantly different color). While Lauren and former fling Stephen Colletti have been spotted numerous places together lately, Lauren has insisted lately that the two are "just friends". Of being seen at the LA Kings game with Stephen, she tells US Weekly , " I was there with a big group of friends. IÂ&rsquo;m dating but no specific person ." Way to keep your romantic life a mystery, Lauren! Lauren Conrad seen on Jan 22 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted checking out her newly purchased $2.5 million West Hollywood home with mom Kathy and a handful of designers on January 22, proudly displaying her new banged bob hairstyle for the paparazzi. Wearing what at first glanced seemed to be a black dress, but upon closer inspection was in fact a playfully paired high waisted black miniskirt (like Parameter's High Waist Mini Skirt in Black ) with a casual black tee (check out Rails' Kenna Scoop Tee in Black ), Lauren accessorized with a go-to pair of black shades (similar to Nour's Baba Sunglasses in Oro Bianco ), patent leather black flats (like Matiko Footwear's Verne Flat in Black ) and of course her all-time favorite bag, her quilted black Chanel. The day that Lauren steps out carrying a DIFFERENT designer bag will seriously be a red letter day in my book! While the starlet seems to be popping up everywhere lately, it seems that she will be followed by her "Hills" camera crew for quite some time to come. Conrad spoke to US Weekly recently, saying, " We'll film Â&rsquo;till some kind of conclusion happens in our lives ." When asked how long she sees herself shooting the show, she replied, " I donÂ&rsquo;t know. IÂ&rsquo;m just having fun with it now. We had two weeks off during Christmas, and it was really nice to have a break. But at the same time you miss the crew. The crew members are really good friends of ours so itÂ&rsquo;s kind of cool to get back into it. Â&rdquo; Who are you kidding Lauren, you're going to be filming reality TV until you're a silver haired granny! Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 30 2007 in Las Vegas, NV. "Hills" star Lauren Conrad was spotted partying and striking poses with fellow castmates Lo Bosworth and Audrina Patridge at LAX nightclub in Las Vegas on December 30, sporting what looks like a new, shorter 'do. If she really did get a few inches taken off, I think it will be a great change for '08! Each girl was decked out in an adorable and stylish party dress as they partied the night away; for a dress like Lauren's, check out Karen Zambos' playful Velvet Tube Dress in White , for a similar style to Lo's frock, take a look at LaROK's similar Julia Short Dress in Vista (they're both the same champagne-y shade), and to nab Audrina's look, opt for Betsey Johnson's flirty Ruffle Dress in Black . It seems that contrary to previous reports, there was no big old dramatic New Years Eve confrontation with Lauren and former "Laguna Beach" nemesis Kristin Cavallari, but instead Lauren was seen smooching a mystery man just days after she was spotted necking with former flame Stephen Colletti! Lauren and Audrina hosted a NYE bash at the McClellan-Palomar Airport in San Diego (talk about random), and were allegedly paid a cool $20g each for hosting. Not too shabby! However, Lauren was reportedly seen kissing this so-called mystery man at midnight, as well as when she was getting ready to leave the event. I wonder who this mystery man is, and if he will be popping up on "The Hills" any time soon! Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 21 2007 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted at LAX in Los Angeles, California on December 21, going for the most matchy-matchy outfit we've seen on an It Girl (that is, besides Paris, who let's face it, is ALWAYS matchy-matchy) in recent memory. Sporting super skinny grey denim (like Denim of Virtue's Patience 5 Pocket Tapered Jean in Grey ) with a loose fitting white tee on top (check out Rails' Kenna Scoop Tee in White ), Lauren showed her affinity for the color red with the rest of her 'fit. In red Chuck Taylor Converse, a red jacket (like Johnson's Jimmy Jacket with Tie Belt in Red ) draped oh-so-casually over her arm and a red, white, blue and tan striped vintage-esque scarf, you just know LC was thinking to herself, "Boy, I hope the paparazzi follow me to the outfit to photograph this outfit I spent so many hours perfecting in front of the mirror!" In other Lauren news, it seems that MTV producers of her hit reality show "The Hills" might be planning a convenient New Years Eve between her and former Laguna Beach rival Kristen Cavallari. According to Page Six , Lauren and Kirsten will have a " bizarre New Years Eve. Apparently, both Conrad and her on-again, off-again boyfriend Brody Jenner, who has dated Cavallari in the past, will welcome the new year from the Setai Hotel and Resort in Miami. Unbeknownst to Conrad, so will Cavallari. " Oooh, I can smell the drama already! Either way, I'm sure all those "Hills" fans out there will be watching to see if these reports turn out to be more than just rumor. Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 12 2007 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted outside Urth Caffe in West Hollywood on December 12, looking as perky as ever and with a firm grip on her BlackBerry. In a casual-chic outfit consisting of a sheer printed top (check out Karen Zambos' Bell Sleeve Top in Opal for something similar) with a funky necklace (like Kuo Ting Jewelry's Puffed Coin Bead Necklace ) and black leather bag (similar to Aaneta's The Rock Large Bag in Black ). Of course, LC finished off her look with a pair of black leggings... I wonder if Lauren and Lindsay Lohan had to battle it out for sole ownership of black leggings who would win? Talk about a fight to the death! While she was waiting for her car from the valet, Lauren spoke to a few press about her current dating situation. She said, " I'm not really searching for anyone. I'm just goingout and having fun. I'm not dating anyone. " In regards to pick-up lines, Lauren specifically said that she will not go for any cheesy lines. Lauren's dating life is lactose intolerant! She said, " I want [a guy] that comes up and approaches you but in a non-cheesy way. " Don't we all, Lauren, don't we all. Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 22 2007 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad and fellow "Hills" buddy Audrina Patridge spent last Thursday afternoon, November 22, living their tough life, which consisted of (what else) shopping and lunching! Lauren went back to black in her basic ensemble consisting of a black sweater (just like Woo's Bella Top in Black ) with leggings (like Hudson Jeans' longer Skinny Leg Knit in Black ), a knit cap, decorative flats and a big black shoulder bag (I'm loving Linea Pelle's Dylan Large Shoulder Bag in Black ), while Audrina dazzled in a playful bejeweled tunic top with leggings as well and casual flip flops. The two hit up Mauro's Cafe inside Fred Segal and then shopped 'til they dropped, with Lauren staying hydrated on not one but FOUR beverages throughout the day (a Diet Coke, an Evian, a Red Bull and a pink slushie, in case you were wondering). Lauren has been off living her fabulous life in Paris lately (and of course bringing "The Hills" camera crew along with her), so it seems that she will not be remembered as the "girl who didn't go to Paris" any longer. However, there is already some gossip about her Parisian adventure, as Perez Hilton reported that a hunky guy has been hired by MTV producers to show LC around the city, amongst other things. Casting a member of the show? Now that's just impossible (cough Audrina cough). Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 12 2007 in West Hollywood, CA. Lauren Conrad and fellow "Hills" hottie Audrian Patridge checked out the new H&M; in West Hollywood on November 12, and LC knew exactly which trend to hop on board with right now: scarves! Currently, fashionistas like Ashlee Simpson and La Lohan can't get enough of 'em, and Lauren picked a patterned blue and tan scarf to complement her otherwise simple and chic. Wearing dark skinny jeans (like 7 for All Mankind's Lucy Jean in Marine ) tucked into boots, a black tank (check out Hank Vintage Threads' cute Butterfly Tank in Black and brown shades (Nour's Kiara Sunglasses in Manner Mania ), Audrina kept her outfit simple as well in a flirty white top (like Paper Denim & Cloth's Cotton Dobby Blouse in Winter White ) and vintage-wash jeans (similar to Deener's Charmer Slim Boot Jean in Sodium ) with flip flops. Like I report with basically every Lauren entry, there is STILL a lot of drama surrounding the authenticity of "The Hills", to which Lauren finally felt like she had to address. She tells US Weekly , " There have been some rumors in the press about "The Hills" being fake. Many of you have been asking me if the rumors are true. There are false rumors every week about me and I canÂ&rsquo;t address every rumor out there, but I feel like this was important for me to respond to. The show is not fake and this is really my life. " Hmm... what do you think? Do you take LC's word for it, or do you think that some and/or most of the show is staged? Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 06 2007 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was snapped at the Maxim Party for "Assassin's Creed" hosted by Kristen Bell on November 6, rocking a basic LBD with simple accessories. Her Little Black Dress, like Lotta Stensson's Mod Dress in Black or Yoana Baraschi's luxe version, the Isadora Cashmere and Satin Mini Dress in Black , work well with silver bangles (like Mickey Lynn Designs' Set of 3 Hammered Bracelets in Silver ), black nails and black pumps. While "The Hills" has been catching a lot of flack lately for people thinking it's fake, Star Magazine is now claiming that Lauren and Heidi might actually be friends! Allegedly, the girls were seen together in the parking garage of Lauren's apartment on the weekend before Halloween, laughing and getting into Lauren's black Mercedes. A source says, " They were laughing, hugging and being very affectionate with one another. There were no MTV cameras around. This seemed like the real deal. I saw Heidi coming to visit Lauren at her apartment without her fiancÃ© Spencer Pratt. I think Lauren and Heidi made a secret pact not to tell anyone. " Either that, or they've made up and can't be seen out in public together until the episode airs! However, this doesn't seem likely, as a preview of this week's episode shows Lauren telling Heidi, " I want to forgive you, and I want to forget you. " Hmm... I've said it before and I'm sure I'll say it again- something's fishy in the Hills! Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 26 2007 in Los Angeles, CA. Lauren Conrad was spotted leaving lunch with on-again, off-again flame Brody Jenner at Taste in Los Angeles on October 26, not looking too pleased with whoever she is on the phone with. Wearing a black leather jacket with a very Nicole Richie-esque scarf, round shades (like Nour's Kiara in Manner Mania ), an orangey-red leather bag (Linea Pelle's Angie Medium Bag in Crimson is oh-so-similar), super tight, super skinny dark-wash jeans (similar to Antik Denim's Skinny Morgan Jean in Faded Black ) and still rockin' black nails, I wonder what's getting Lauren so down in the dumps? Cheer up girl, your show is a hit! It might be fake, but it's still a hit! Wait wait wait... you didn't hear all of the goss circulating lately regarding the authenticity of "The Hills"? Just last week, Perez Hilton posted screen-shots from the show of LC on her date with male-model Gavin, and post-date when she called Brody to tell him how lame the date was and that she wanted to hang with him instead. On the date, red nails. After the date, clear polish. Something's fishy in the Hills! Now there are rumors that Heidi doesn't really work at Bolthouse and Audrina doesn't work at Sony... I wonder what is actually real on this supposed "reality" show! And what do you think, does it matter if certain things are staged or re-created for the sake of entertainment? Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 19 2007 in West Hollywood, CA. There's that smile that I've been missing! Since her frown-alicious public outing in my last post, it's nice to see Lauren Conrad so peppy while shopping in West Hollywood on October 19. Wearing a a drapey white top (Laura Dahl's York Top in Winter White has a similar shape) with skinny dark jeans (like Aristocrat's Kent Jean in Nordic ), a funky necklace (like Castaway Jewelry's Brass Leaves, Obsidian Horn & Quartz Hoop Necklace ) and her favorite crimson colored bag of-late (like Linea Pelle's Angie Medium Bag in Crimson ), Lauren looks cool and casual. While the rumors have been running rampant lately that a majority of what happens on "The Hills" is fake or staged, co-star Audrina Patridge is speaking out about how real the show is. While the word is that Audrina doesn't even work at Sony, like they portray on the show, she says, " Everything is real. Lauren and me are real friends. We live in our apartment. ThatÂ&rsquo;s real, like where we work, everything. The situations are real ." Glad she cleared that up, although I know first hand that one of the things that Audrina said is real is definitely not... anyone willing to guess? Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 02 2007 in Santa Monica, Ca. Lauren Conrad was photographed filming her hit show "The Hills" in Santa Monica on October 2, sporting a perplexing mix of summer and winter fashions. In a charcoal grey oversized sweater by Vince (for a similar look to LC's, check out Elizabeth Gillett LTD's Giselle Cardigan in Chrome (go up a size for a roomier fit like Lauren's) or a coat version, like LaROK's Lulu's Jacket in Charcoal Grey ) with matching grey flip flops and her favorite red string Hamsa hand bracelet, it looks like Lauren's still a beach girl at heart. Even when cozying up in a big sweater, girl's still gotta wear her sandals! For those of you "Hills" fans out there, I'm sure you are just dying to know more of what happened between Brody and Lauren in Vegas from what was featured on this week's episode. Well, it seems like it's going to have to be left to your imagination. While we know that the two sneaked some kisses and even cuddled up to one another for a drunken nap, Brody is speaking out, and not really filling in to many gaps. He says that " There was a lot of things they didnÂ&rsquo;t show. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Â&rdquo; I guess there are still guys out there that don't kiss and tell! Brody continues that he talks to Lauren " every day, itÂ&rsquo;s just like any other friend. " Hmm, friend... or friend with benefits?? I think these two need to realize that they would work great together, they both seem laid back and unpretentious- make it happen guys! Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 28 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. "Hills" starlet Lauren Conrad and her co-star, Whitney Port, were photographed looking chic and sophisticated at the Declare Yourself 2007 party on September 28, rocking the black and red look. While LC slipped into a sexy black tube dress (like Lotta Stensson's Gathered Mini Tube Dress in Black ) with black heels (check out Matiko Footwear's Lisa Heel in Black ), Whitney stood out in Crispin & Basilio's Tuxedo Top in Red and black tights- and both girls flaunted bright red nails. Considering the fact that the show is MTV's top-rated program of the moment, Lauren is definitely the network's golden girl, meaning that what she says goes! The chic phenom was flirting with the idea of not filming a third season of her hit show because she would have to share screen time and be forced to interact with BFF turned arch-nemesis Heidi Montag and her "fiance" Spencer Pratt. Lauren recently told "Seventeen" that she "came dangerously close to not doing season three, because I really didn't want to do the show with Heidi and Spencer." Apparently, just the thought of sharing publicity with the couple sent shivers down her spine, yet MTV convinced Lauren to stick it out. I'm sure they made it well worth her while, if you know what I mean! While Lauren has been working on her clothing line recently, Heidi has been popping up on the cover of "US Weekly" with the headline reading "Revenge Plastic Surgery". Lauren (not one to miss out on taking a jab at Heidi's life) has spoke out about Heidi's surgery, saying "I don't think revenge is a good reason to get plastic surgery," Lauren smiled. "If you get plastic surgery, it should be for yourself." Zing! This is shaping up to be the reality television feud of the decade! Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 18 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. Lauren Conrad was spotted at LAX on September 18, definitely struttin' her stuff with her luggage in tow (I mean, check out that pose of her holding her phone with her fantastic bag oh-so-casually swung over her arm). Wearing an outfit consisting of a knit cap, a baggy black top (like Zoa's Bias Cut Print Top in Black ), dark skinny jeans (similar to Citizens of Humanity's Avedon Stovepipe Jean in Dark Paris ) tucked into leather boots, her BlackBerry Curve and a black patent leather bag (like Moe Bags' Cami Patent Lamb Bag in Janna ), LC looks chic and she knows it. What she also knows is that her debut clothing line will be a big hit, because "The Hills" is currently MTV's most-watched show. The line is exclusively available online, and launched on Saturday- the same day as rival Heidi Montag's 21st birthday. Smooth, Lauren- tryin' to steal the thunder! Lauren's line (creatively titled "Lauren Conrad") is full of cute essentials, if you don't mind paying $135 for a basic jersey dress. Seems like looking like the "Hills" starlets doesn't come cheap! Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 05 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. The Hills star Lauren Conrad was spotted at LAX on September 5 and the down-to-earth cutie was all smiles for photographers as she carried a drink from Starbucks and her trademark black Chanel bag. Wearing a patterned dress (similar to Bellekat's Mischa Dress in Weekend Print or Walter's grey version, the Cap Sleeve Dress in Charcoal ) with big shades (like Nour's Noushi Sunglasses in Crystal Mystery ) and jeweled sandals, Lauren was on-point with her classic and chic style. The internet was abuzz these past few days that Lauren would be walking in Marc Jacobs' show in New York for fashion week and models didn't seem to be very happy about this. Allegedly, the models complained that they were going to have to sign releases so that they can be filmed for Lauren's reality show. Oh please- like they wouldn't jump at the chance to be on MTV's number one rated show! But worry not models... Lauren's not going to be stealing your spotlight; Marc only hired her to work on the show. And just think, Lauren came from being a Laguna Beach babe to being a stylish runway assistant. Thank you MTV! Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 07 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. Reality show star turned household name Lauren Conrad was spotted doing some shopping at the Grove in Los Angeles on August 6, possibly stocking up on hot new duds to wear during the filming of the current season of "The Hills". Wearing a casual LBD (LaROK's Paillette Dress in Black is a much ritzier, dressy version of Lauren's dress; Karen Zambos' Slip Dress in Black is also similar) with metallic silver sandals and a big white bag (check out Dutchy Handbags' Nana Tote in Bone ), Lauren was showing that simple summertime style that she's known for (but where's the headband?). Now that Heidi and Spencer have made such a big fat deal about how Ryan Seacrest released the wrong single on his radio show, it seems that everyone has heard Heidi's track, "Body Language". When Lauren was asked on the most recent after-show for "The Hills" if she's heard Heidi's song, she said she hadn't. However, I'm thinking that she probably has but doesn't want to seem like Heidi or her musical aspirations take up any of her precious time. LC also spoke up to In Touch Magazine , saying that " I promise you: I'll never release an album! I don't really have very many talents! I'm OK with it, though. I think as far the entertainment industry is concerned, the abilities to act and sing are something you are born with or have to work very hard at, and I don't have either talent, so I'm not going to pretend like I do! " Sounds like a not-so-thinly veiled stab at Heidi to me! Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 01 2007 in Hollywood, Ca. Lauren Conrad was seen leaving the hottest place to be in LA on a Wednesday night, club Les Deux, on Aug 1 with girlfriends (and "The Hills" co-stars) Audrina Patridge and Lo Bosworth. The girls were out and about filming their "reality" show, and made sure that enemy Heidi Montag was nowhere in sight. Wearing a metallic short-sleeved dress (Zoa's Short Sleeve Tie Back Dress is a basic, non glitzy version of LC's) with black pumps, Audrina stepped out in a black mini (like Karen Zambos' Bow Tube Dress in Black ) with a heart necklace (similar to Erica Anenberg's Heart Necklace ) and Lo opted for a blue silk number. The girls recently opened up to US Weekly about what's going on in their lives and revealed a few secrets of the upcoming season, and Lauren especially spoke out regarding her new dating mentality. She says that she used to " get too attached to a guy, then I get all emotional and, like, then we break up and whatever happens. I just want to have fun with dating. And when you break up, it's always the girl sitting around being so upset about it, and then the guy's out dating the next week. So I said I was going to go into it with a "guy" mentality where it's, like, fun. " I can totally, like, see where she's coming from! Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 01 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. As the whole MTV-watching world is getting ready for the new season premiere of Â&ldquo;The HillsÂ&rdquo;, Lauren Conrad is spending the beginning of her summer hitting up events and seeing a lot of a new guy. Lauren attended Chris Evans and Eric PodwallÂ&rsquo;s Annual Birthday Bash at the Wallop Lounge at Eleven on July 1, wearing a deeply cut blue top (letÂ&rsquo;s hope that she took advantage of boob tape!) like HarkhamÂ&rsquo;s more casual Liquid Jersey Tee with dark skinny jeans and a long, black rope she tied around her waist like a belt. Lauren showed up at the fete with Paris HiltonÂ&rsquo;s ex, and Â&ldquo;Desperate HousewivesÂ&rdquo; actor, Josh Henderson, who she is rumored to be hooking up with. Apparently, the two were seen canoodling at the bash, and left the party hand in hand, where a source says that the two were on their way home together. Although itÂ&rsquo;s pretty well known that Josh and Paris were Â&ldquo;datingÂ&rdquo; as a publicity stunt (where was he during her time in the slammer?), I wonder if the same can be said for him and Lauren? Maybe if everything goes as planned, heÂ&rsquo;ll be appearing on upcoming episodes of Â&ldquo;The HillsÂ&rdquo;. Or was that merely his intention from the beginning? HmmÂ&hellip; Lauren Conrad seen on Jun 23 2007 in Laguna Beach, Ca. "Hills" star Lauren Conrad appeared at an opening of Starbucks (a Starbucks opening is a celebrity event now?) in her hometown of Laguna Beach with friend and new roomie Audrina Patridge on June 23. Lauren and Audrina seemed to wear almost identical dresses in different colors (Vanitas' Liberty Mini Dress in Black and Laura Dahl's Billie Dress in Black are similar to Lauren's dress, while Woo's Kai Dress in Kelly Green resembles Audrina's), coincidence or new BFF's coordinating outfits together? I'm leaning obviously towards the latter. With season 3 of "The Hills" fast approaching, these two are out there appearing at just about any and every event (once again, Starbucks?) together, and Audrina seems to be in the prime position to become the show's new Heidi, always with Lauren and living with her- I just hope she won't ditch Lauren as a friend over some annoying loser Ã  la Heidi! While Heidi and her (to quote Lauren) "sucky person" fiancÃ© Spencer have been popping up for obviously staged photo ops lately (hello, did you check out the pictures of them eating ice cream and Heidi flashing her huge rock for the cameras?), Lauren has been hanging with friends and of course has kept busy filming. Now, the trailer for the upcoming season has hit YouTube, and it looks like there's a major Lauren/Heidi catfight brewing towards the end of the clip! Now I know that this "reality" show is many people's guilty pleasure, but I just have to say that I am glad Lauren's friend Lo will be featured this season- she was always my favorite! Lauren Conrad seen on May 17 2007 in New York, NY. Lauren Conrad hit the streets of New York on May 17 for a photo shoot for AvonÂ&rsquo;s line of cosmetics named Mark, looking cute and girl-next-door-ish as ever. Dressed in a funny little hat and scarf over a long sleeve white tee and denim mini (like DeenerÂ&rsquo;s Mixer Mini ), Lauren went for her usual simple yet stylish look. While she was all smiles on the set of the photo shoot, I wonder whether or not she was smiling when she heard of ex-BFF, Heidi MontagÂ&rsquo;s, engagement to total idiot Spencer Pratt? Heidi was always there for Lauren when she went though breakups and hook-ups, that is, until Spence slimed his way into their lives. Now, Lauren says that she has Â&ldquo; great family and friends that love me and know what really happens, and thatÂ&rsquo;s all that matters. People are always going to make up talk, so you really just canÂ&rsquo;t let it phase you. I mean, it obviously hurts and itÂ&rsquo;s really hard to deal with, but IÂ&rsquo;ve kind of learned to let it go. Â&rdquo; So mature! Lauren is also so responsible, saying how she realizes that she has sort of become a role model to little girls all over. Lauren says that Â&ldquo; when fans come up to me, a lot of them are little girls and thatÂ&rsquo;s a really good reminder that I am responsible for what kids are looking up to. You donÂ&rsquo;t want some of your behavior - that may be acceptable for a 21 year old - to been seen as cool by younger girls. Â&rdquo; Amen! Lauren Conrad seen on May 08 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. Is Lauren Conrad just finding out that Paris is headed to the slammer? Is she on the phone with ex-BFF Heidi finding out that she is the one who spread those nasty sex-tape rumors? Don't know, but it's clear that Lauren is clearly shocked about something! At LAX on May 8, Lauren was spotted wearing skinny jeans (like these Paper Denims ), a white button-down with the sleeves rolled up, and her trademark headband and Tory Burch flats. Lauren was headed to New York for a photo shoot for Mark cosmetics, and while she was taking a break from shooting outside of the Gansevoort Hotel, the paparazzi were going crazy as always. But when a makeup-free Drew Barrymore walked out of the hotel's door, the paps shifted their attention from Lauren almost immediately! When they were done shooting Drew, it was back to the perky "Hills" starlet. Wonder if they were filming her show while all of this went down! Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 26 2007 in Hollywood, Ca. Lauren Conrad hit up Us Weekly's Hot Hollywood Party last night, April 26, and stuck with her usual simplistic style. In an almost side-boob revealing black bubble dress (Karen Zambos' Cross Bubble Dress is similar, but a little less revealing) with black peeptoes and a gold ring, Lauren looked bronzed and happy, in light of all the drama she's been dealing with lately. For those of who you don't follow the career of "The Hills" darling, she's been beating off sex-tape rumors with a stick! Allegedly, she made a sex tape with ex-boyfriend, the scumbag known as Jason Wahler, which Jason wanted to sell to make some quick cash before heading off to the slammer. Lauren always denied any and all existence of the tape, which both Perez Hilton and TMZ.com reported on. So, nobody really knew the truth. Was there a tape out there and Lauren was just lying in order to maintain her good-girl image? Was the whole thing a rumor with absolutely no substance? A few of these answers have now been revealed. Apparently, the porn company that was going to be purchasing the tape for distribution decided to take a pass, because the tape was too "vanilla", and not hardcore enough. Kind of like LC herself.. as cute and sweet as vanilla! Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 22 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. As many of you know, the MTV hit reality show "The Hills", chronicling little fashionista Lauren Conrad 's tumultuous life in Los Angeles, is very easy to be swept up in. Over the past few weeks, things have gotten pretty topsy turvy in the hills, as Lauren and BFF Heidi are on the skids over the fact that Heidi's sheisty boyfriend Spencer is being just that, shiesty, and LC doesn't want to see her best friend get hurt. But now there is a weird tension between the two.. and it's only getting worse by the day! After Spencer and his best friend Brody Jenner, who dated Lauren for a nanosecond, talked trash about everyone in the latest issue of Details , Lauren purposefully did not attend the US Weekly Oscar Party (which was co-hosted by "The Hills"!) because she couldn't stand to be in Spencer's presence. Sources tell us that Heidi and Spencer attended (with a bodyguard in tow.. pshh like these two need a bodyguard) and were looking cozy all night, even though Heidi said that she wished Lauren was there. Tres tragic! All this drama did not stop Lauren from keeping her head up and attending other pre-Oscar parties and gatherings. On February 22, Lauren hit up the Haven House Oscar Suite to pose with some goodies (hey, those pink iPods aren't going to sell themselves!), looking cute in a pair of dark skinny jeans , Tory Burch flats, a nautical striped sweater and black scarf . I just hope Lauren and Heidi can rekindle that friendship of theirs, and that Heidi kicks Spencer to the proverbial curb! Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 06 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. As Lauren Conrad attended the Betsey Johnson show at LA's Fashion Week in February with new BFF and roomie Audrina Patridge, in dresses like these from Karen Zambos and Karanina , everyone was wondering, "Where's Heidi?" With the finale of this super-entertaining season of "The Hills" ending with Heidi ditching Lauren and moving in with bonehead BF Spencer, everyone was wondering whether or not Lauren and Heidi remained as close, or if Spencer accomplished what he set out to do: break up the best friends. US Weekly is reporting that a "Hills source" (oh geez) is saying that " Lauren and Heidi are no longer friends. They never talk or hang out. Spencer achieved his goal and broke them apart. " Ugh, that Spencer is just the most annoying dirtbag ever! Heidi was also noticeably absent from the finale party on MTV, apparently because Spencer wasn't invited and she wouldn't go without him. The two are still living together (I'll pause for the shocked gasps) and Spencer is now running his mouth to the mag, saying that he and Heidi are " going to take over the world. Heidi is the biggest star from that show. " Wake up Spencer! Heidi is a joke and so are you. If that wasn't bad enough, US Weekly is also reporting that Heidi got breast implants on Monday, and that " she did this for herself, and is hoping to keep it as private as possible. " Right. That's why US Weekly found out! And I'm also sure Spencer had no say in it. Seems like Lauren is better off hanging out with Audrina and her recently reunited BFF, the adorable Lo from season 1 "Laguna Beach" fame. Lauren must be excited to finally have some time off from filming now that the season is over, so she can tell her friends what she really thinks of Heidi! Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 08 2006 in Hollywood, Ca. It's nothing but single, smooth sailing these days for "The Hills" It-Girl Lauren Conrad , and that's just the way she likes it. After a summer romance with Laguna Beach "bad boy" (notice the quotes) in which she gave up a trip to Paris with Teen Vogue, LC is now saying that she is a "bad dater". Lauren tells People Magazine how she is " a bad dater. I'm the most socially awkward person, like carrying on conversations and stuff. ... I don't want to date anyone right now anyway, so it doesn't really matter. " And if you were as fiesty and cute as LC, you wouldn't wanna be tied down anyway! Back in November, LC hit up the Playstation 3 Launch Party in Hollywood with "Hills" co-star Heidi Montag looking hot in a navy minidress and black bag . Can't wait to see what happens on this season of "The Hills"! Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 25 2006 in Hollywood, Ca. The past is definitely coming back to haunt Lauren Conrad and her relationship with ex Brody Jenner. Back in November, the two dated briefly after Brody split from Nicole Richie and "Laguna Beach"-enemy Kristin Cavallari and LC broke up with Jason, also from the show. Back in October, when asked if he and Lauren were dating, he said " I don't know what you consider dating, but we're seeing each other, we're having a great time with it. She's an amazing girl. " Apparently the two split because they both needed to be single for a while, not for anything scandalous like he cheated on her with Kristin or anything. But now, that season 2 of "The Hills" is airing, the two have a constant reminder of the beginning of their relationship. Hope no sore subjects are brought up! Back in August, LC was spotted shopping on Melrose in a pair of dark skinny jeans and a basic white tee with big brown shades . Stay single Lauren, it definitely looks good on ya!
