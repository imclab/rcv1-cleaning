The Sand and Sage Sports Car Club invited beginners to check out their cars. There were all kinds of vehicles used in the races from drag racers to family cars with bike racks still on them. The cars were timed as they went through the course, but today&#39;s races were all for fun and for a cause. "People come out, they get three runs for $10 and it all goes to a good cause," said Lynn Rogers of the club. "Everybody leaves with a smile on their face and a few cones get knocked over." All of the profits earned today at the auto-cross event went to the Tri-Cities Cancer Center.
