Art is a veteran of over 50 years in Southern California broadcasting. Art’s automobiles are his second passion, radio being the first love of his life, with some 270 cars now in his collection. The classics range from Packards to Pontiacs, Morgans to Mustangs, several Jaguars, Rolls Royces, and Howard Hughes’ 1940 Cadillac Formal Town Sedan, to name just a few. Each of Art’s cars is special in some way: perhaps it is a rare vehicle, or has an interesting history, or reminds Art of some special event in his own life. Every car is a “driver,” and Art takes each one out for a spin every few weeks. Additionally, Art has created a museum which houses the world’s largest collection of working and beautifully restored antique telephones and radios. He has wonderful collections of model trains, gas pumps, antique slot machines, pedal cars, movie memorabilia and other interesting “stuff.” The Astor Classics Event Center is dedicated to advancing education and knowledge through the preservation, restoration, and presentation of a living collection of automotive and communication technologies. It is here at the Astor Classics Event Center and Living Automotive and Communication Museum where this dream assemblage has become a reality. http://www.astorclassics.com http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 7 years 4 months ago and modified 9 months ago No comments 53 views 24 visitors 1131 files  Copyright © 2008 Dave Lindsay Automobile Driving Museum Feb 17, 2008 The Automobile Driving Museum 610 Lairport Street El Segundo, California 90245 310.909.0950 http://www.automobiledrivingmuseum.org/ http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 5 years 7 months ago and modified 8 months ago No comments 58 views 4 visitors 519 files  Copyright © 2010 Dave Lindsay Browning Kimball Classic Car Museum Sep 18, 2009 Browning Kimball Classic Car Museum Ogden Union Station Ogden, Utah http://theunionstation.org/carmuseum.html http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 3 years ago and modified 9 months ago No comments 2 views 2 visitors 54 files  Copyright © 2009 Dave Lindsay California Automobile Museum Apr 1, 2009 04-01-09 and 03-06-12 California Automobile Museum 2200 Front Street Sacramento, California http://calautomuseum.org http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 4 years 1 month ago and modified 1 year 2 months ago No comments 28 views 20 visitors 349 files  Copyright © 2000 Dave Lindsay Carroll Shelby Collection Jun 30, 2000 Las Vegas, Nevada http://www.shelbyautos.com/ http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 12 years 4 months ago and modified 12 years 4 months ago  21 comments  4 views 3 visitors 51 files  Copyright © 2011 Dave Lindsay Central Texas Museum of Automotive History Oct 29, 2011 Central Texas Museum of Automotive History 2502 Hwy 304 Smithville, Texas 78957 http://www.ctmah.org/ http://www.dicksclassicgarage.com http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 1 year 9 months ago and modified 8 months ago No comments 28 views 13 visitors 586 files  Copyright © 2009 Dave Lindsay Crevier Classic Cars Apr 7, 2009 Crevier Classic Cars 365-B Clinton Avenue Costa Mesa, California http://crevierclassiccars.com http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 4 years 5 months ago and modified 9 months ago No comments 17 views 12 visitors 252 files  Copyright © 2001 Dave Lindsay Deer Park Winery &amp; Car Museum Jul 12, 2001 Deer Park Winery &amp; Car Museum - Escondido, California http://www.deerparkwinery.com/ http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 12 years 3 months ago and modified 12 years 3 months ago  43 comments  14 views 10 visitors 370 files  Copyright © 2011 Dave Lindsay Dick's Classic Garage Oct 27, 2011 Dick's Classic Garage 120 Stagecoach Trail San Marcos, Texas Dick's Classic Garage is a part of the Central Texas Museum of Automotive History.

The idea circulated for many years until an inspired group of local automotive enthusiasts propelled the idea forward. In 1979 the San Diego City Council first considered the issue and in 1980 they gave unanimous approvel to the museum and granted a long term lease for one of the historic buildings in the jewel of San Diego - Balboa Park. After spending approximately $1 million renovating and upgrading the building, the San Diego Automotive Museum opened in December of 1988. Since then millions of local auto enthusiasts and tourists from all over the world have visited our world-class collection. Today the museum stands as a living tribute to the automobile and what it has meant to our culture. The San Diego Automotive Museum is a non-profit corporation under section 501(c3).

With only an eighth grade education and a co-signed note for $500.00 Hal started his small business later to become known as &quot;The largest, most diversified garden center in five western states&quot;. During the difficult beginnings his friends told him he was &quot;too far out, be broke in sixty days and back looking for a job&quot;. Hal did have a couple of part time jobs, as a Sunday School bus driver and at nights at a gas station. He and his wife Helen also ran a side business, &quot;Sierra Hatcheries&quot;, to make ends meet. One of the first entries in the company checkbook shows a check drawn for $55 to purchase a used model &quot;T&quot; delivery truck. The nursery grew and prospered until the outbreak of World War II, which caused profound changes in the nursery and Simpson family. With most Americans leaving their civilian jobs to work in the war effort, Hal was left with only a few employees. This brought the need to change the name of the business from &quot;Simpson'S House of Service&quot; to the present &quot;Simpson'S Garden Town Nursery&quot;. The other, more personal change would be the beginning of a life-long friendship. Hal did business with the Yamane nursery family. Even though they were American citizens of Japanese decent, they like many others were forced to live in an internment camp in Arizona. On a handshake, Hal ran their nursery while they were gone. At the end of the war Hal returned the business to the family. Because of the deep respect between the two families, the friendship is still alive even today. After the war Simpson'S Garden Town grew dramatically; with over 70 trucks, 47 telephone lines, an F.T.D. florist shop, full landscape department, lawn mower, pet shop, and several other outlets. The small business that was once at the end of the road, now called Colorado Boulevard, home of the yearly &quot;Rose Parade&quot;. Tragedy struck in November of 1959 when a four alarm fire broke out, destroying the nursery buildings and supplies. Though most of the records and charge receipts were gone, customers came forward to pay their accounts and suppliers helped out by restocking. In 1968, the State of California , in the name of progress took most of the nursery property to build the 210 freeway. With the money from the freeway sale, Hal bought the 185 acre &quot;Barrett House Ranch&quot; in Jamul. Hal had considered retiring, but his heart told him to continue growing plants. He regenerated Simpson'S Garden Town Nursery on a portion of the ranch in Jamul. This time in a style suitable to the area, there were no phone, no salesmen, no deliveries...just good plants stock at a reasonable price. Today the nursery has expanded to include Gift Shops, Pottery, all varieties of seasonal color, Herbs, Grasses, along with many new introductions for the interested gardener. And for the vintage car enthusiast there are large barns with over 50 antique vehicles to view, for free. The nursery is owned and operated by Hal Simpson's Granddaughter Cathy and her husband Lee. Their sons are learning the business when not attending school. So come on out, take a short ride to the country. We hope to see you here. http://www.simpsonsnursery.com/ http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 5 years 6 months ago and modified 8 months ago  1 comments  16 views 12 visitors 320 files  Copyright © 2009 Dave Lindsay Surf City Garage Aug 23, 2009 Surf City Garage Huntington Beach, California http://www.surfcitygarage.com/ http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 4 years ago and modified 1 year 2 months ago No comments 3 views 3 visitors 99 files  Copyright © 2008 Dave Lindsay The Nethercutt Museum The Nethercutt Museum 15151 Bledsoe Street Sylmar, California http://nethercuttcollection.org http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 5 years 6 months ago and modified 9 months ago No comments 7 views 7 visitors 137 files  Copyright © 2007 Dave Lindsay Vic's Garage Apr 29, 2007 Vic Edelbrock's Garage Torrance, California http://www.edelbrock.com/ http://www.socalcarculture.com http://socalcarculturesblog.blogspot.com Album was created 6 years 4 months ago and modified 9 months ago  2 comments  2 views 2 visitors 146 files   About Fotki Advertise on Fotki Downloads Pricing Contact Us Customer Service File a Complaint Terms of Service Privacy Policy Non-Profit Support Choose Language &copy; 1998-2013 FOTKI INC or its affiliates.
