The five giant banners hang at the location (100m below the ground) where the particle was discovered. He has also worked with a population geneticist on a project exploring our ancestral journeys out of Africa 60,000 years ago, with a molecular biologist to synthesize an actual DNA strand made from a sequence randomly generated by participants visiting his museum exhibit, and with botanists in eco-art projects to reforest Florida's mangroves, native trees and wildflowers. Cortada is currently working with scientists at Hubbard Brook LTER on an water cycle visualization project driven by real-time data collected at a watershed in New Hamphire's White Mountains. Cortada serves as Artist-in-Residence at FIU College of Architecture + The Arts in Miami.

Written by Christopher Durang; Directed by Kevin Marshall. In this often zany yet poignant comedy by Christopher Durang, a second chance at life is the last punishment Miss Witherspoon expected to receive after personally ending her first. Living life again and again until she gets it right, Miss Witherspoon’s journey is slyly bittersweet, entertaining, and ultimately hopeful in this wonderfully irreverent crazy-quilt fantasy.
