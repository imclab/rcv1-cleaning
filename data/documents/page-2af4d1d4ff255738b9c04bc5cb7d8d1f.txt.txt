Lamar Odom -- The NBA Drug Trail  Robin Thicke&#039;s Wife NOT Mad at Miley CyrusFor Molesting Hubby At VMAs 2 Chainz Arrest -- Cops Say Rapper&#039;s Friend Waved Around Constitution Lady Gaga -- ASS ON PARADE for Joseph Gordon-Levitt Pippi Longstocking Star Sex Tape Being Shopped -- She&#039;s Coming Into Your Town Alright CELEBS VIDEOS PHOTOS SPORTS TV 22 minutes ago BY TMZ STAFF Pippi Longstocking Sex Tape Will NEVER See the Light of Day Exclusive Tami Erin -- the actress who played Pippi Longstocking in the 1988 movie -- insists she had nothing&#160; to do with her sex tape being shopped around town ... in fact, she tells TMZ Live, she'll stop at nothing to make sure it NEVER gets released. 39-year-old Erin called in moments ago and she was irate -- blaming a bitter ex-boyfriend for attempting to sell a private hardcore sex tape to the media. She said, "I think he's the biggest piece of sh*t on the planet for doing this to me." As for any sex tape deal, Erin says she has not been approached about selling the tape, which is good ... because in order for a company to release this kind of footage, it would need Erin's permission. She sounds really angry ... and we're not calling BS ... but we do want to point out that Erin's not exactly averse to public displays of sexuality, posting photos like these on Twitter over the last couple months.

According to our count, Joe has been ordered to serve at least 270 DAYS in county jail. He's also been sentenced to 36 months probation and has been ordered to complete a Level 3 Anger Management course. He's also been ordered to complete 1 year of psychological counseling at a rate of 1 session per week. During the sentencing, the judge expressed serious concerns with Joe's explosive temper -- and warned that it could get him in trouble in the future unless he learns how to keep his cool. Bond will be set at $250k. Joe is currently being handcuffed and escorted out of the courtroom. 10:31 AM PT -- Joe's lawyer is begging the court for mercy. 10:29 AM PT -- Joe's motion for a re-trial has been SHOT DOWN. Now on to sentencing ... 9:53 AM PT -- Joe's lawyer is calling BS on the accusers -- claiming he can now prove the women lied during the trial, and therefore Joe deserves another chance to prove his innocence. Among Joe's arguments -- he claims the women's story about not having cell phone reception at Joe's mansion are untrue ... and they have the phone records to prove it. Joe also claims an accuser's story that she was "choke slammed" on Joe's tile floor is impossible because he doesn't have tile anywhere in the house. 9:40 AM PT -- The hearing has begun. Due to courtroom rules for this particular hearing, we will only be livestreaming the audio. 8:57 AM PT -- Francis is inside the courtroom, waiting for his case to be called. 8:50 AM PT -- Francis just arrived at the courthouse with his girlfriend Abbey Wilson . She's hot. 8:41 AM PT -- We're told Francis is on his way to the court -- and should arrive momentarily. It's D-Day for Joe Francis ... the day the " Girls Gone Wild " mogul will learn his sentence for attacking a woman at his Hollywood mansion back in 2011 ... and he's facing serious time behind bars. TMZ will be streaming live from inside the L.A. courtroom when Joe faces the judge later today. The hearing is scheduled to begin at 8:30 AM PT. As we previously reported, 3 women had accused Joe of taking them to his Hollywood home -- following a night out -- and refusing to let them leave. He was also accused of attacking one of the women, choke-slamming her head into his tile floor. Francis was convicted on 5 charges total, including assault, 3 counts of false imprisonment, and 1 count of dissuading a witness from reporting. Never one to go down without a fight -- Francis recently filed court docs demanding a new trial based on allegations of insufficient evidence. We'll see if the judge buys his argument when the hearing begins. Stay Tuned...    See also Joe Francis -- I&#039;m Renting a Sea Lion ...

TMZ has learned. Sources connected to a Westin hotel in Memphis tell TMZ ... in March of 2012, shortly before Lamar was cut from the Mavs, he stayed in one of the guest rooms while his team was in town playing the Grizzlies.&#160; Our sources say when Lamar left, hotel employees found major carpet damage ... including quarter-sized burn marks. The damage was so bad, the hotel had to replace the carpeting in the room. Our sources say hotel employees also found white powder on the desk blotter and the room reeked of noxious smoke.&#160; Our sources say it was obvious there was serious drug use going on in the hotel room.&#160; The Westin is one of numerous hotels where NBA players stay when they're on the road. TMZ has contacted a number of these hotels in various cities. We've learned from several hotel employees ... they had complained about the state of the rooms when Lamar left -- similar to what happened in Memphis -- and this was while he was playing for the Lakers.&#160; Our sources say no one on the Mavs knew Lamar was a substance abuser while he was on the team, but everyone knew something was seriously wrong with him. We're told that during at least part of the time he was playing for the Mavs, Lamar was smoking Oxycontin and cocaine. Odom's problems were so severe, he was cut from the Mavs mid-season and paid in full just so he would go away. TMZ broke the story ... the drug use escalated to crack -- and we're told Lamar's level of crack use is now alarming and life-threatening.

We're told both parties ultimately decided to walk away from the situation without pursuing charges. So ... case closed. Alec Baldwin &#160;has struck again ... allegedly ... grabbing a photog on the streets of New York in front of several witnesses ... and now the NYPD is involved.&#160; Sources connected with Baldwin tell TMZ ... the photog was the aggressor. We spoke to the photog -- not a TMZ guy -- who tells us he did nothing to provoke Alec saying, "All I can say is I was doing my job asking him normal questions and he flipped. That's all." The photog says he called police ... and cops responded to the scene. A friend of Alec tells us ... Alec was with his wife Hilaria during the incident ... and Hilaria, in an effort to avoid the pap, ducked into a nearby tea store. We're told Alec also called police. The friend tells us, "What kind of sick twisted psychopath chases a woman who just got out of the hospital from having a baby into a tea store?" Hilaria just gave birth to the couple's daughter on August 23.&#160; Story developing ...

As we reported, 2 Chainz and ten other people on his tour bus were all arrested last week following a concert in Oklahoma City ... after police accused them of smoking weed on board. You'll recall, cops pulled over 2 Chainz' bus because of a busted taillight, but upon approaching the vehicle ... cops say they smelled pot and attempted to search the bus. But the driver refused to let cops on board -- and according to the police affidavit which was just released, one of the bus' passengers actually held a physical copy of the U.S. Constitution against the bus window ... "as if challenging officers" with his civil rights. Fact is: the police DID have probable cause to enter the bus because they smelled pot and saw smoke inside ... but the rapper and his entourage decided to assert their non-existent civil liberties anyway. In the end, officers towed 2 Chainz' bus and its passengers to a police lot -- where it sat for hours while cops obtained a search warrant -- and everyone was eventually arrested, 2 Chainz included. The United States Constitution ... it doesn't work that way.

Lamar's face looked gaunt when he was spotted Monday afternoon driving his SUV around the San Fernando Valley ... not far from his home with Khloe Kardashian . As TMZ first reported ...Khloe kicked Odom out of the house last Wednesday when he rejected her attempt to stage an intervention -- hoping to convince him to get treatment for his addiction to crack cocaine.&#160; But 2 interesting signs from Lamar's outing Monday -- he was still wearing his wedding ring ... and he was spotted driving into the gated community where he and Khloe live. As we already told you ... Khloe's not giving up, and has had at least one meeting with LO within the last 48 hours.

In fact, he's already back behind the wheel of a new whip. DVD was in Calabasas yesterday -- in a brand spankin' new Jaguar (a loaner) -- and the 87-year-old was still joking about the frightening moments when a Good Samaritan pulled him from his burning car on the side of the 101 Freeway. "Well, I needed a little PR anyway," Van Dyke said. Dick tells us he learned one big lesson from the incident -- a lesson that will probably restore your faith in humanity.

Clippers refused to re-sign him in light of his abuse of drugs, including crack cocaine ... TMZ has learned. NBA sources tell TMZ, team officials really wanted to re-sign Lamar over the summer after he performed well last season, but he was nearly impossible to reach ... and they couldn't make progress on contract discussions. We're told the Clippers were STILL interested despite Lamar's flaky behavior, but after news broke about the NBA star's issues with drug addiction ... the team closed the book on a new deal, permanently. Former L.A. Laker forward Antawn Jamison has since struck an agreement with the Clip Show, and the team's roster is now full ... meaning Lamar's SOL ... at least with the Clippers.

Kevin Hart was probably right -- there's a decent chance he DID let one rip during the *NSYNC reunion at the MTV VMAs. Fatone arrived back to L.A. yesterday -- where we immediately grilled him for LYING TO OUR FACES in the days before the show ... when he told us he wasn't in NYC for a surprise performance. Of course, Fatone insisted he wasn't lying -- that he really was in NYC for a birthday party and not for the VMAs ... but c'mon man!!!!! (Your pal Chris already admitted the plan was in motion a couple of weeks ago. Busted!!!). But back to the mystery fart ... Joey says if he did blast one during the VMAs (as Kevin joked in the moments following the performance) Fatone says there's a reason the comic would know ... and it all has to do with Kevin's height (5'4").

'cause the actress who played the famous firecrotch in the 1988 movie is now starring in a hardcore sex tape being shopped around town, TMZ has learned.&#160; The "star" of the tape is 39-year-old Tami Erin -- who played the freckle-faced red head girl in "The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking" back in 1988 ... when she was 14. We've seen the X-rated footage ... which appears to have been shot very recently and features Tami in various sexual situations -- most of which involve an unidentified penis. And no, she's not wearing pigtails in the video ... you sick freaks. So far, it's unclear if anyone has purchased the tape -- but we're guessing Steve Hirsch's ears just perked up. So far, no comment from Pippi's people. See also Paris Hilton -- Sex Tape Sequel ...

Here's the back story -- the Giudices were kickin' it on Ship Bottom beach on Long Beach Island, NJ Saturday afternoon (with roughly 30 friends and family members) when they were approached by a teen girl beach worker. Sources on the scene tell us, the employee asked to see the Giudices' "beach badges" -- basically $5 admission tickets required to chill in the sand -- and the family flipped, refusing to "pay to go to the beach." We're told one family member even yelled at the girl, saying, "F*** you, f*** this we are not paying for the f***ing beach. This is a joke!" Remember: 5 dollars per person. We're told the girl started crying, and when beach PD responded ... the Giudices continued to kick up a stink, but eventually coughed up chump change. Of course, Teresa and Joe are facing massive money fraud charges, but still -- 2 TV stars oughta cough up 5 dollars without a fight.
