 1. Movies on the Green : The outdoor summer movie program will continue well into the fall on The Green, located at 435 S. Tryon St. Bring something comfortable to place under you (blanket, folding chair, etc.) and catch a flick under the stars. The series runs on the last Thursday of each month through October, with seating and prize registration commencing at 6:30 p.m. and the film beginning when it gets dark. Admission is free; light refreshments will be available for purchase at the site. 704-332-2227. 
 2. Get To Know The Show:  Love the theater and interested in seeing what goes into creating a great play? Well, you should probably check out a "Get To Know The Show" production, which allows audiences to see "workshop" versions of plays for free. There are a few coming this fall for  Saffire the Uppity Blues Women  (Sept. 4 at the Duke Energy Theatre and Sept. 12 at the newly opened Harvey B.

 5. Photography at The Light Factory:  This fall, The Light Factory is rolling out a fleet of visually stunning exhibitions. One show that really stands out is  Group f.64 and the Modernist Vision: Photographs by Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, Willard Van Dyke, and Brett Weston . According to the folks at the Factory, "Group f.64 was an informal association of California photographers who promoted straight photography through the use of the large format view camera, contact printing, and using the smallest camera aperture -- which is f/64 -- to create the greatest depth-of-field." (Sept. 17-Jan. 3, 2010. Free. Knight Gallery at The Light Factory, 345 N. College St. 704-333-9755.  www.lightfactory.org .) Another show we're digging is  The Ties that Bind , which features the works of photographers Preston Gannaway and Dana Romanoff. (Sept. 17-Jan. 3, 2010. Free.

For a full list of events, visit  www.plcmc.org/novello . 
 14. Herb & Dorothy:  Winner of the Audience Award at four separate film festivals across the country, this documentary relates the tale of Herb and Dorothy Vogel, a modest couple who over the course of several decades had managed to accumulate a vast collection of over 4,000 paintings, many by artists who would go on to become famous.

Admission is $7 for nonmembers, $5 for TLF members.  www.lightfactory.org .
