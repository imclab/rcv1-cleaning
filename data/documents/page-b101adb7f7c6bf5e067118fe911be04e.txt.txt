Here is the first: The Lexus LF-C &#8211; even though it was originally debuted at the 2004 New York Auto Show, I still think this is one sick car! Specifications I got these from a sign on the display: Convertible Hardtop with 4-Position Glass Roof (Coupe, Targa, Speedster &amp; Fully-open Convertible) One-touch button operates Convertible Hardtop Front-mounted V8 engine Rear Wheel Drive 6-Speed sequential shift automatic transmission 21-inch read wheels with 285/30ZR21 tires 20_inch front wheels with 235/35ZR20 tires Cross-drilled front &amp; rear disc brakes Retractable rear view cameras (instead of mirrors on the doors) Rear view camera on bumper (instead of inside rear view mirror) Rear view cameras display their images on the dashboard screen Machined crystal tail lamps with LED lighting technology Suede-trimmed bucket seats 3-Dimensional gauge cluster Translucent crystal center console and door trim with blue backlighting Drive-By-Wire steering Formula One inspired steering wheel and shifter Pictures Just imagine this beast coming up behind you! If you look closely, you can see the Lexus logo in the headlight! I wanted to get a picture of the dashboard so you could see the cameras but they would turn the car on for me! That&#8217;s the review camera under the license plate.

Great improvement on the leather and some other lexus performance parts too. But the parking system is quite intriguing.  Sorry, the comment form is closed at this time.
