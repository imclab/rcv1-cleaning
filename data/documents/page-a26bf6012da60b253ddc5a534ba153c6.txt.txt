Fine Art Posted by ELIZABETH BARNWELL |  November 14th, 2010 at 9:06 pm Blazing tangerine, fire-engine red, an ocean of intense blue &#8211; you will be inclined to put on your sunglasses when stepping into the Steven Alexander Vibrolyx exhibition at Gremillion &amp; Co. Fine Art. Alexander’s work is soothing and easy to view &#8211; the uncomplicated, clean lines and straightforward slabs of acrylic paint allow the viewer to focus on what’s most important to the artist: color. “I am trying to build, out of color and substance, a place for the viewer&#8217;s consciousness &#8211; where unexpected associations and resonances may occur, where past and future merge with the present moment, and the stuff of life and love has corporeal presence - states of being, embodied in paint.” There’s no doubt Alexander builds a place for color in your consciousness &#8211; it’s unavoidable. The bright hues literally beam from the massive canvases, as though each piece has a halo of light resonating from a light source within. Once you’ve taken in the overwhelming presence of a single color &#8211; a theme that defines many of Alexander’s compositions &#8211; your eyes adjust to the subtle application of islands of contrasting pigment set into the predominating hue. It’s a lovely trick on the eye that brings an appreciation to the deceptively simple nature of Alexander’s work. Steven Alexander&#8217;s work shows at Gremillion &amp; Co. Fine Art until December 5. Gremillion is located at 2251 Vantage Street, Dallas, TX 75027.
