 The City of Auburn offers a variety of cultural arts programming for&nbsp; performing arts ,  visual arts ,  public art ,  special events  and more! 
 
 SPOTLIGHT 
 &nbsp;Luminous at Les Gove Park 
 
Light posts throughout&nbsp;Les Gove Park&nbsp;have been wrapped in a knitted sleeve of bright yellows, oranges, reds and purplesartist  Suzanne Tidwell . Whimsical knitted 4â&euro;&trade; tall lanterns, titled "Luminous" gracefully hang beneath the each wrapped polesâ&euro;&trade; light fixture.  Suzanne Tidwell is a fiber artist working throughout the Puget Sound area and creates large-scale, site specific fiber installations of vibrant color that transform public areas into places people want to frequent.&nbsp; Her work has been described as Dr. Seuss meets Christo and challenges the belief that the sole purpose of knitting is to make garments or provide warmth.&nbsp; Her work is often temporary and encourages people to live in the moment, because you never know where an installation will turn up or when it will disappear!&nbsp; Information on the artist can be found on her website:  http://suzannetidwell.com .
 This temporary art installation is coordinated through the City of Auburn, Parks, Arts and Recreation Division and funded in part by a grant from 4Culture.&nbsp; Luminous will be on view through September. 
 
 Auburn's 2012-2013 BRAVO Performing Arts Season features over&nbsp; 70 shows  and includes an incredible line-up of music, dance, comedy, films, theater and kids programming. All of these great performances take place at either the Auburn Avenue Theater or the Auburn Performing Arts Center, showcasing talent from across the continent in downtown Auburn!
