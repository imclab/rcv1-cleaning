The all-new 2014 BMW 4 Series is slated to replace the current 3 Series coupe. The range will start off things with a 2.0-liter turbo 4-cylinder engine in a 428i model and then go to the range-topping 435i featuring the 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder. Of course in true BMW fashion you will be able to select an M Sport trim. Of course we will still away the aggressive M4 to drop at a later date, but for now we get the idea on what the 4 Series will look like and can draw our own speculations for an upcoming M4.
