Published: 21:00 July 8, 2013 [if gt IE 7]><style>.ie8 {padding-bottom:0px !important;}</style><![endif] [if !IE]><style>.notie7 {padding-bottom:0px !important;}</style><![endif]  Image Credit: Hareem Al Sultan Image 1 of 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 With an estimated 200 million viewers across the Arab region, Ramadan TV has become huge business. Advertisers are keen to get their message out, while channels look to increase their annual profit. And making the big bucks is now more important than ever, due to the current political instability plaguing some parts of the Middle East with economies suffering. Khulud abu Homos, senior vice president of programming at the Dubai-headquartered network OSN tells tabloid! many new content is released during the period. “We always show new and exclusive content, but during Ramadan, I would say that new content increases by 20 per cent. This is because it is possible to commission more shows as more are available.” Religious content, especially those targeting the youth, is important to her network, she adds. “We have had feedback that we also get viewers from outside the Arab world who don’t follow Ramadan but want to learn more about Islam. So it is very beneficial and educational.” But, Abu Homos warns, the deluge of special shows might not be as good as advertisers think it is.

Another thing that strikes me is the synergy of adverts with the content takes you out of sync; it impacts the viewing experience when you are watching a drama only to made to watch musical commercials in between. Obviously, when you lose viewers, you work against your target.” The executive says Turkish dramas are still top draws in the Arab world. “While I would love to say no, Turkish dramas are still driving viewers. The last season of Hareem Al Sultan became the highest watched show amongst Western and Arab viewers. I think one of the key attractors is that the international political situations increased curiosity about the Islamic empire.” With Ramadan upon us tabloid! brings you the top shows not to be missed this season: DRAMA AL ARRAF One of the biggest dramas of the year will no doubt be Adel Imam’s Al Arraf.
