My daughter loved this language arts program. It gets the job done and the readers are very sweet July 3, 2012 LATL Red: Mixed feelings I have mixed feelings about this curriculum, now that we've plugged away with it for the entire year. I love that it is all-inclusive and uses readers as well as real books (that's what I like most). I do wish it used the real books even more. I also like all the hands-on materials. That really helped my little kinesthetic learner. It is also very affordable, which is SO important. With that said, I am unhappy with the fact that this is not anywhere near 2nd grade level according to our state standards. We've ended up skipping more than half the book and I had to supplement a lot of my own materials and printouts. The &quot;spelling&quot; portion is nearly non-existent and I had to add &quot;Sequential Spelling.&quot; It kind of made for a very incoherent day (which defeats the purpose of using this curriculum). If you are coming straight from the Blue Book, this will be fine, but if you're coming from something else, it will be all review, you shouold probably look at the yellow book. I wish I would have. If you've got the money, you may want to invest in one of the more expensive curriculums. I gave it 4 stars becasue it's a good base to work from, and being a former public school teacher, I've got the know-how and resources to add what we needed, where as a new homeschool mom may not. June 5, 2012 This is a wonderful LA program. It may &quot;seem&quot; too easy for some who are used to typical workbook style but in the end this program really delivers. The only thing I would ever add to it would be a bit more writing opportunities....we've always added a daily journal. April 11, 2012 Great All In One LA Program! This is my first year homeschooling. I chose to go with LLATL because it was recommended to me by several homeschooling friends.I love that this is an all in one set. I did not want to have fuss with different books for each sub area of language arts, and I am really enjoying it's ease of use.I have to admit that I underestimated how important the readers are to the course. I figured that all I needed was the student book, but I am finding that we end up missing a substantial amount of the course. I would highly recommend that you get the full kit with readers to get the most out of this program.The book is well made and has a wide range of activities to help kids retain what they are learning. Extra activities, mini books, and flip books are all things my son is enjoying about this program.One small thing I would change, though, is the binding of the book. As we are nearing the middle of the book, it is sometimes hard to write neatly as it does not open to a lay flat position. Tear out pages, or a coil binding would greatly improve the student manual. However, if this is a problem for you too, you could always cut out the pages or pay your local print shop to cut off the spine and coil bind it for a small fee. I wouldn't let this minor thing stop you from using a great program!
