Well fear not James Franco fans because he is back! The Hollywood actor is set to host his own art show. The 35-year-old actor &#8221;will document his provocative explorations of the world of art&#8221; in the new series called James Franco Presents,  according to his Instagram page. The show, which premieres in November, will feature Franco&#8217;s own work and pieces from other artists. In a press release, James said: &#8220;This is a show where content dictates form and form dictates content. It is an art show that is an art piece, meaning the show has synched with the rhythms of my life and work.&#8221; What do you guys think? Are you going to be tuning in?
