A: One common way to get a used car price is the Kelley Blue Book website. The used car dealership price may be based on the suggested retail value there, known as the used car &quot;blue book price&quot; or simply &quot;book price.&quot; Q: What is the meaning of the suggested retail used car price listed in the blue book? A: The blue book retail value is what the used car dealer would like to get for the car, assuming a well-reconditioned used car with a good title. The used car retail price is an asking price the used car dealership uses for getting the second hand car buying process started, and includes various costs the used car dealership will have. The actual transaction price for buying the car used at the dealership will almost always be lower. Q: Can I find out how much my own used car is worth as a dealership trade-in? A: Used car values are also available at Kelley Blue Book . Remember, though, those are private-party sales values, so local auto sales shops may offer you less as a trade-in than what you might expect to make if you sold your old car by yourself. Q: What does the used car dealership sticker tell me about buying the car used? A: The big thing on the used car dealership sticker is whether the second hand car is being sold &quot;as is&quot; or is under a dealership warranty. You are responsible for all necessary repairs when you buy a car used as is, unless you can prove that the dealership has made a bold specific statement about the used car that is untrue. Q: What should I do if I begin to feel pressured to buy a used car at a dealership? A: Good question. In general, you should remember your power in the competitive used car market, that you have lots of options in buying a car used. You don&#39;t have to buy a particular used car from a particular dealership salesman: the second hand car choice is yours. Feeling pressured is a good sign that there&#39;s a problem with some aspect of the used car dealership process, and that you need to go slower or walk away. Both are perfectly reasonable actions in the normal process of buying cars used. Q: Should I trade in my own used car to the dealership or sell it separately? A: Ideally you should probably buy the used car you want from the dealership without a trade-in and sell your previous used car separately. There are arguments both ways of course regarding whether to trade in a used car at a dealership. The bottom line is that the used car dealership will have to make money on the trade-in of your current used car: that&#39;s what it means to be in the business of used cars. With a little effort, you can probably direct some of the money the used car dealers would have made on your used car into your own pocket. Q: What should I know about the used car contract? A: You should know that the used car contract is important to read thoroughly, and that it&#39;s not a formality to be regarded lightly and skipped over quickly. Make sure the contract to buy the car used includes everything you expect the used car dealership to provide, including the price you think you have agreed on with the used car dealership. Don&#39;t sign the used car sales contract before having a mechanic look at the used car. The price for buying the car used may need to come down significantly for necessary repairs. Q: What do I do before going to the used car dealership? A: Two big things: figure out used car pricing, and figure out used car financing. Look at the used car you want to buy, maybe at several used car makes you would consider, and find out what used car dealerships are likely to be charging for those used cars. You don&#39;t want the basic used car price to be more than is practical for you. And don&#39;t think the financing cost for buying the car used is less important than the price: it&#39;s really part of the used car price. Shop around for good used car financing just as seriously as you do for a good used car price. Q: Can I count on a legally-required three-day return option at a used car dealership? A: No. There is no such thing as a legally-required three-day used car return option. You are protected only by what the used car dealership puts in writing regarding returning the second hand car, and must not misunderstand that. If a dealership salesman uses terms like &quot;great return policy&quot; or &quot;money back guarantee,&quot; ask to read the policy so you understand what&#39;s really being promised in writing about returning the used car. Q: What&#39;s the best way to find a good used car dealership? A: An ideal way to buy a car used is with a Diamond Certified used car dealership. Diamond Certified second hand car dealerships offer advantages that are hard to beat: highest scores on random customer references, customer-friendly business practices, customer satisfaction principles, mediation, and great guarantees for buying cars used.
