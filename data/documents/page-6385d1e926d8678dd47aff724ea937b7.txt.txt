You&#8217;d have to think pretty carefully about what you messed with, but all things considered think of all the fun you could have. Looking at this incredible Opel Calibra that&#8217;s all I can think about, because right [...] More... A PRELUDE TO A SPA WEEKEND August 27, 2013 11:00 am by Paddy McGrath 0 comments I think I was about 13 years old when I accompanied my Dad to a local rally. It wasn&#8217;t our first time standing in the ditches, watching the cars blitz past as it was something I can remember doing regularly as a kid. What was different this time was that he handed me his beloved [...] More... PROJECT EVO: TO THE GREEN HELL AND BACK August 27, 2013 7:45 am by SuzyWallace 0 comments I can&#8217;t look at the picture above without grinning like an idiot. In fact, I&#8217;ve pretty much been wearing this same stupid expression since I returned from my trip to Germany last week. Nine days of true Speedhunting. What I originally thought was going to be just a normal Nürburgring visit (as if such a [...] More... STEP-BY-STEP: INSIDE A TIME ATTACKING 650HP SILVIA August 27, 2013 5:30 am by Brad Lord 0 comments Extensive projects rarely turn out the way they were first imagined. Time, of course, can be one contributing factor, as can funds – or lack of. Then there are the projects that through evolutionary steps become so much more than their owners could ever imagine. The latter is certainly true of Hans Ruiterman&#8217;s Nissan Silvia S14.5 [...] More... A GT-R KIND OF DAY&#8230; August 26, 2013 7:00 pm by Dino Dalle Carbonare 0 comments It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but a few days ago the stars aligned and I finally found some time to take the GT-R out for a much needed drive. Not only was I eager to put my new wheels and tyres to the test, but it had been far too long since I had [...] More... #FEATURETHIS IS HEADING TO SONOMA August 26, 2013 4:00 pm by Mike Garrett 0 comments In just under two weeks time, on September 7th and 8th, both Larry Chen and myself will be heading to Northern California&#8217;s Sonoma Raceway where the FIA Word Touring Car Championship will be making its second-ever stop on American soil. In addition to the fender-banging action that will be unfolding on the scenic race circuit, [...] More... MIATA INSPIRATION: MEET PROJECT-G August 26, 2013 3:15 am by TarynCroucher 0 comments The Mazda MX-5 (or Mazda Miata as you might know it), is a vehicle that will always stay very close to my heart. The NA6 MX-5 was the first car to ever bring me true #JoyOfMachine; and I’ve had a soft spot for them ever since. I’m not alone in my infatuation either, and somewhere [...] More... IN THE MOMENT: ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE August 25, 2013 7:30 pm by Paddy McGrath 0 comments A lot of things surprise you when you first venture to Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. The obvious one is Eau Rouge, but you sort of expect it to take your breath away so I don&#8217;t think it counts. For all of my years watching F1 and playing the related video games, I never once realised just how steep the downhill run from La Source (turn one to you and I) is to the bottom of the &#8216;red water&#8217;. As the cars accelerate past the apex of Spa&#8217;s slowest corner, they use all the track they can to catapult themselves towards the wall that lies before them. Every inch counts, every tenth matters. - Paddy McGrath More... THE BEST OF THE BEST: GLOBAL AUTO&#8217;S SKYLINE GT-R August 25, 2013 12:30 pm by Dino Dalle Carbonare 0 comments During our short visit of the Global Auto shop a couple of months back we caught a little glimpse of Yasui-san&#8217;s special Bayside Blue R34 GT-R among the tantalizing selection of ready-tuned cars on sale. The car was being prepped for an excursion to Okayama circuit where it spends a lot of its time being put [...] More... IN THE MOMENT: THE POLE SITTER August 24, 2013 5:15 pm by Paddy McGrath 0 comments It&#8217;s quite one thing to watch Formula One cars lap during practice. Sure, they&#8217;re still quicker than anything else on four wheels, but you always get the impression that there is so much more potential on tap. Even during the early stages of qualifying, it&#8217;s clearly a case of who blinks first. With the pace steadily increasing across the pack, it eventually climaxes as the last cars cross the finish line. Each car faster than the previous until one is left victorious. If you didn&#8217;t catch the qualifying session at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps for this weekend&#8217;s race, check your listings and prepare yourself for a classic&#8230; - Paddy McGrath More... FAST CAR MAGAZINE: OCTOBER ISSUE PREVIEW August 24, 2013 5:30 am by sh-fastcar 0 comments Good afternoon Hunters of Speed. Variety really is the spice of life and that’s why we’ve rammed the latest Fast Car mag with what you might call an ‘eclectic’ mix of feature rides. We’ve scoured the planet to find a collection of rides that couldn’t be more different – everything from a Bentley rimmed RX-8 [...] More... IN THE MOMENT: WEBBER VERSUS THE RED RIVER August 24, 2013 1:00 am by Paddy McGrath 0 comments You hear about it, you read about it, you see it on TV and you drive it in video games. Eau Rouge is like no other corner in the world, but that isn&#8217;t half the story. Stood at the bottom, you can hear the Formula One cars approach from La Source. They&#8217;re accelerating downhill like [...] More... ASTON MARTIN WORKS: THE POWER OF HERITAGE August 23, 2013 11:30 pm by Jonathan Moore 0 comments There was a tradition in the old days of what sir wanted being what sir would get. Where the discerning gentleman or woman could expect a certain level of service. A certain quality. Although modern car companies still sell bespoke cars – Aston Martin being a prime example – there&#8217;s something about the old cars [...] More... WILD CHILD: RACE-READY V8 VANTAGE ZAGATO August 23, 2013 7:30 pm by Brad Lord 0 comments I&#8217;m forever amazed at the rare and historically-significant cars that turn up in New Zealand. Considering the country&#8217;s infatuation with the automobile and lineage to companies like McLaren, it&#8217;s a given I guess, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only Kiwi who hopes that these machines will keep arriving for many years to come. Like [...] More... POLL: JAMES BOND&#8217;S BEST ASTON MARTIN? August 23, 2013 4:30 pm by Mike Garrett 0 comments As promised at the end of yesterday&#8217;s retrospective story on the subject, we&#8217;re back for our reader to poll to select the best Aston Martin driven by Agent 007 since 1964. Whether its the classic lines and gadgets of the original DB5 or the more recent appearance of the modern DBS, there&#8217;s some fine spy-approved [...] More...
