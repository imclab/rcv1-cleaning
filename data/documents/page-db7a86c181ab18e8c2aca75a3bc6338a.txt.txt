 Adult Nights at Legoland Discovery Center                   
 
 
 
 Legoland Discovery Center 
 If you&rsquo;re sitting in a bedroom staring at your fully assembled Lego Creator Green Grocer set, then you clearly have a passion. A very specific one that includes showing those miniature interlocking blocks who&rsquo;s boss. (Hint: It&rsquo;s not Tony Danza. Or Judith Light. It&rsquo;s you.) There is a special evening just for your kind: Adult Nights at Legoland Discovery Center. For a...   Read more about this event &gt;&gt;

 Half-Priced Monday Dinner                   
 
 
 
 Barcadia 
 Mondays are sneaky. They&rsquo;ll kick you in the groin without apology, and the pain &mdash; oh, the excruciatingly merciless pain &mdash; will stay with you until your weekend liberation returns and applies party salve on your wound. The least it could do is take you out to dinner. Why not treat yourself to a cheapskate&rsquo;s meal out and fortify your body for the remainder of this...

 Ten Bells Tavern 
 Ten Bells Tavern may be the perfect neighborhood pub. They pour solid pints of beer, serve great bar food and have an unassuming patio where you can drink to the setting sun. You can get Buffalo wings anywhere, and they will likely come with processed blue cheese and pale celery. Here the dip is played up with chunks of delicious moldy cheese and the strands of celery are crisp and edible. If...   Read more about this event &gt;&gt;

 Contemplation: Emerging Female Photographers from Japan                   
 
 
 
 Texas Women's University Gallery 010 
 Sometimes in the middle of the workweek we all need a moment to calm down, a little stillness to help us regain perspective and what little sanity we can. If you need to find space for contemplation, might we suggest heading to Texas Woman&rsquo;s University&rsquo;s new exhibition, Contemplation: Emerging Female Photographers from Japan. As the curators put it, &ldquo;Photographs depict no...   Read more about this event &gt;&gt;

 Galleria 
 Our city&rsquo;s skyline is modest by big city standards &mdash; a concentrated cluster, for sure, but it packs an iconic punch. There&rsquo;s no mistaking that you&rsquo;re home when you see Reunion Tower&rsquo;s big glowing ball or the stately lights of the Arts District &mdash; it&rsquo;s a silhouette that comforts and even inspires a certain level of pride, despite the showiness and the...

 Hotel Texas: An Art Exhibition for the President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy                   
 
 
 
 Dallas Museum of Art 
 Dallas started gearing up for the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination a year ago, and it will be interesting to see how much revision and hand-wringing goes into November&rsquo;s &ldquo;festivities.&rdquo; On a more interesting note, the Dallas Museum of Art (1717 N. Harwood St.) is presenting Hotel Texas: An Art Exhibition for the President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy, a...   Read more about this event &gt;&gt;

 The Library Bar 
 The Library Bar sits on the ground floor of the historic Warwick Melrose Hotel in the Oak Lawn area, not far from downtown Dallas. Designated a Dallas Historic Landmark in 1983, the original apartment hotel was built in 1924. The Library Bar offers patrons a relaxing, dimly lit piano-bar environment in a laid-back library setting -- though at night, it's far too dark in The Library Bar to...

 Krishna Janmashtami, A Birthday Party                   
 
 
 
 Sri Sri Radha Kalachandji Mandir Hare Krishna Temple 
 Have you ever wanted to celebrate a 5,000-plus year birthday? It&rsquo;s time to celebrate the birth of Krishna, everyone&rsquo;s favorite eighth incarnation of the Vedic supreme being Vishnu. Krishna Janmashtami is a celebration that spans most Hindu traditions, including the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, otherwise known as the Hare Krishnas. And here in Dallas...

 Natasha Bowdoin: In the Garden                   
 
 
 
 Talley Dunn Gallery 
 Nature and a good book: If you&rsquo;ve got those, you&rsquo;ve got everything. Such fundamentals are the basis of Talley Dunn&rsquo;s newest, Natasha Bowdoin: In the Garden, which opens from 6 to 8 p.m. Saturday. Bowdoin has two new projects to flaunt: Book of Nature, which interprets Emerson&rsquo;s writings through cut paper and hand-written text, and Flowers for Henry, a look at...

 Norman Rockwell and the Art of Scouting   
 
 
 
 National Scouting Museum 
 Norman Rockwell and the Boy Scouts of America are often underestimated these days. Rockwell is often looked upon as little more than a talented illustrator who&rsquo;s given too many unimaginative home decorators an easy out for folksy Americana options, while it seems as though today&rsquo;s grade-schoolers are only into smartphones and PSPs, not merit badges that boast the ability to...

 Mable Peabody's 
 First opened in 1979, Mable Peabody's Beauty Parlor and Chainsaw Repair served as a watering hole for Denton's gay and lesbian community. That is, until March 2007, when an arsonist, using the bar's own liquor to set the nightclub ablaze, torched the original Mable Peabody's. In the fall of 2008, owner Kelly Sanders reopened the bar just a block or so from the original spot. The new location...   Read more about this event &gt;&gt;
