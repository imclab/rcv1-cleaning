Satellite Emails in bad English offering to buy your item and paying by certified check, cashiers cheque, building society or Bankers draft for an amount greater than you are asking, then to send the balance on to their shipping agent once the cheque has cleared, usually by Western Union. This is a scam using stolen/forged bank drafts/cheques which can clear in 3 days and bounce a couple of weeks later. By then you have paid the scammer the surplus cash and your bank pulls the total amount back. DO NOT REPLY. The authorities are aware of this fraud but appear to be doing nothing about it.

If in doubt ring Nigel at 4x4web on 01488 657888 It is of course possible that the above requests are completely genuine. Seen any flying pigs recently? Extract from LloydsTSB web site... and Lloyds article on selling 4x4s This is actually reffering to the "help me get rid of all this money scam" The Nigerian money offer should be reported to the fraud squad of your local police station. If you have actually lost any money through this con, call the West African Organised Crime Section of the National Criminal Intelligence Service on 020 7238 8012. Whatever you do, do not reply to any of these communications. How to receive payment for your 4x4 vehicle OR When is a Bankers Draft not a Bankers Draft? From Lloydstsb Bank Given the increase in fraud and forgery it is imperative to independently verify that the Bankers Draft or Building Society cheque that you have accepted as payment is genuine. Your bank can make a phone call on your behalf to the issuing bank to achieve this. Should you decide to accept a personal or company cheque (not recommended), be VERY aware that although your bank may confirm that the cheque has 'cleared' after 3 to 4 working days this is NOT confirmation that the cheque has not been returned unpaid. Given postal delays your bank may not discover this for 5 to 6 working days. The only certain way is to again verify with the issuing bank that the cheque has debited the buyers account. Again your bank can do this for you but they will need all details of the cheque that you paid in (keeping a photocopy is a good idea). A more secure way of receiving funds is to ask the buyer to arrange a CHAPS payment or inter-bank transfer directly to your account. Your bank can then confirm safe receipt of the funds independantly. Be aware that 'remittance advices', 'confirmations' and other paperwork provided by the purchaser may be forged. Finally, be advised that any buyer overseas offering to send a Bankers Draft for a greater sum than the sale price, requesting that you refund the difference is almost certainly setting out to defraud you. Sadly this type of scam costs the UK millions every year. For more information go to, www.sucess4business.com, and type 'fraud' in the search function. This will display several related topics.
