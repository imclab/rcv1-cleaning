There are courses that use graphic design programs to generate design and objects and digital and 3-dimensional printers. The department houses the Rosenberg Gallery, which features a full schedule of exhibitions, and the FORM gallery, run by our students. Art history classes cover ancient cave paintings to new media installations, as well as how the study of art brings to light issues related to politics, social institutions, religion and culture. Since the Hofstra campus is just a short train ride from New York City, a center of the art and design worlds, there are scores of possibilities for networking, internships and experiential learning, on and off-campus. Undergraduate majors in the fine arts concentrate in one of the following areas: Painting Design and New Media and Industrial Design Photography Sculpture Ceramics and a distinct academic major in Art History Inside the Artist's Studio Calkins Hall is home to the Department of Fine Arts, Design, and Art History .
