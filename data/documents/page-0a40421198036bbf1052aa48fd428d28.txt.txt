Direct Auto soon became an industry leader and saw the need for an alternative to factory OEM parts. This resulted in the acquisition of a leading Winnipeg aftermarket jobber parts supplier and the launch of a modern store on Wall Street. In 2002, Direct Auto expanded its offering to include rebuilt engines and transmissions. Under the Winnipeg Engine & Trans brand, this provided customers with even more choices, making Direct Auto Parts your one-stop shop for all your auto parts needs.
