Selling Your Car: Be Careful When Selling a Vehicle to a Family Member I recently sold my 2003 Isuzu Axiom to my younger brother; big mistake. I&#8217;m writing this as a warning to anyone who is considering selling their vehicle to a family member. Now, this isn&#8217;t to say that selling your vehicle to a family member is always a bad idea, but in my case, it caused read more... How does Quick Cash Auto pay more? Most car buyers will purchase your vehicle to then quickly sell it at auction. This means the price theyâll be shooting for to resell it will be considerably less than market price. This wrecks of disaster for you, the seller, as the price those dealers will be looking to pay must be low to yield a profit. Quick Cash Auto can sell your vehicle at retail, which means we can pay you must closer to market price. How are leased or financed vehicles handled? When a vehicle is leased or financed it doesnât mean it canât be sold. It means only that the vehicle balance must be paid to release the title. Depending on how much you, Quick Cash Auto can negotiate a pay-off amount for early termination of the loan and get you out of that agreement with any balance from the sale of your vehicle paid to you. We do the work of handling the negotiation and payment of the amount owed to the bank to release the title. Will I lose money if I do not sell privately? This depends greatly on how you look at it. Generally it will take you time and money to list and successfully sell your car to a private buyer. It takes time to meet the buyer and weed out those who will either not show up, or are just window shopping (looking around). When you do find a qualified buyer who has the cash, most times the time it took and the negotiated price will be close to what it would have been to simply sell it fast with us. Remember, many used car shoppers wind up at a dealership after they have shopped around. An Internet site has appraised my car higher? The Internet is a great place to find deals on cars but donât believe everything you read when it comes to selling. Few will pay the Kelly Blue Book price or some similar price from an online car valuation service. Even private sellers will rarely pay a price equal to what you may find online for a used private party sale. These tools are based on computerized valuations and not actual sales. Although you can use these tools for a basic idea of a vehicles value, you should expect 10% to 20% less than published prices. These web sites will not write a check nor will they offer any guarantee towards these quotes. What is the most accurate guide to price a used car? Galves Auto Price List is the most accurate and timely guide to car values on the web. At Quick Cash Auto, we use Galves because it offers the most up-to-date vehicle prices on the market. Galves publishes values weekly and they are focused solely on car and small truck values. Galves is used by most dealers throughout the United States.
