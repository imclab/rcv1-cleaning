It&#8217;s sad, but most of us have experienced it. Since most people don&#8217;t know a lot about car repairs I guess that makes it easy for other shops to take advantage of people.

Our goal is to provide you with such great service that you become one of our many loyal customers.

You don&#8217;t want to feel like they&#8217;re just guessing at what&#8217;s wrong with your vehicle. You don&#8217;t want to be quoted one price and charged another for &#8220;unexpected repairs&#8221;&#8230; Is it possible that they may find something that wasn&#8217;t expected?

I and my family have been taking our vehicles to Overlea Auto Service Center since April 2003. Our cars have always gotten very good care at reasonable costs . They not only take care of the problem you have it there for, the also, while doing your initial problem take time to check to make sure you don&#8217;t have any other problems, such as lights that don&#8217;t work and necessary fluids that are low, tire air pressure and even wiper blades. They are good mechanics with good work ethics and are totally honest . I recommend them without any reservations. &#8211; Robert Chard My experience with Overlea Auto started one Saturday morning years ago when I stopped by and asked for an oil change service. They pulled my car in right away and took care of me . It was always difficult for me to find a service station where you would get treated honestly. Well I found one in Overlea Auto. The owners, Bob and Dave, have been servicing all my cars in my family since that first Saturday 5 or 6 years ago. I&#8217;m so glad that I stopped there that day. Everyone there is friendly and above all, they do excellent work at a fair price . I hope to be taking my cars there for a long time. I have been recommending them to anyone who needs good honest mechanics .
