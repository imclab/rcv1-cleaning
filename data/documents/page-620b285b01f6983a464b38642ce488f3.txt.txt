 Arts and Entertainment Mountain 
 The Arts and Entertainment Mountain is also referred to as the Celebration Mountain.   
 This mountain includes arts, music, sports, fashion, entertainment and every other way we celebrate or enjoy life.  This mountain, like that of government, is so captured by satan that most believers don't feel it can be taken back or if it even should be.  IT ABSOLUTELY MUST BE TAKEN BACK!!!  This is the gateway into the youth.  For a large part of a young person's life, this is the only mountain they care about.  Satan cannot be allowed to have free run at our young.  This mountain is where creativity shows up and God is in the business of creating.  Satan cannot create, he can only counterfeit.  
 The Hivite Nation rules the Arts and Entertainment Mountain.  Their name means villagers and life-giving place.  These are the enemy villagers who are occupying a life-giving place.  They represent counterfeit, deception and perversion.  Our first encounter with a Hivite (in Genesis 34:1-2) was in fact a rape of one of the daughters of Jacob. They pervert and misinterpret what is supposed to be a blessing.  They deceive what was meant for good (ie...sex) to appear to be evil so it will be rejected by God's people.  
 God's spirit wants to move freely through the creativity and passion of God's people.   Every form of art, sport, music, literature, movies and any other form of celebration needs to be produced God's way - by being in His presence and letting His creativity flow through them.  We must help everyone see through the deception of our pop culture and reveal the truth.  We must provide real and lasting alternative forms of celebration. 
 The only way to successfully reclaim these mountains is with prayer and action.  Prayer by itself will not accomplish it and action by itself will not accomplish it.  Only through a combined effort will these mountains be taken for the Kingdom.
