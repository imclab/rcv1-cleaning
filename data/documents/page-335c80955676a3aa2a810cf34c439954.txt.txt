The BSM system can assist the driver in confirming the safety of the surrounding but is not a complete substitute. The driver is responsible for assuring lane changes and other maneuvers. Always pay attention to the direction in which the vehicle is traveling and the vehicle's surroundings. The BSM system does not operate when the vehicle speed is lower than about 20 mph (32 km/h).
