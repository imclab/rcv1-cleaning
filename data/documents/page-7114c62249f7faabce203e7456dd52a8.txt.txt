The movie tells the true story of tobacco company employee Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), who becomes a consultant for a story that 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) is working on about alleged unethical behavior in the tobacco industry. Dr. Jefferey Wigand was a scientist employed by the giant tobacco company firm Brown and Williamson. Shortly after he was fired, Wigand came into contact with Lowell Bergman and, after agreeing to work for 60 Minutes as a story consultant, eventually agrees to an on-camera interview with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer), where he exposes the criminal behavior of the cigarette industry. Despite Wigand's willingness to talk, CBS pulled his story from broadcast and he became the target of lawsuits and smear campaigns without his full story ever reaching the public. The Insider co-stars Diane Venora, Philip Baker Hall, Rip Torn and Debi Mazar. more less Metacritic Score 84 Based on 34 critics 90 The New York Times Is still sleek, gripping entertainment with a raw-nerved, changeable camera style that helps to amplify its meaning. 90 Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan A dead-on tale of corporate power, courage, cowardice and how we live. 70 Variety Todd McCarthy A borderline pretentious, overly inflated picture.
