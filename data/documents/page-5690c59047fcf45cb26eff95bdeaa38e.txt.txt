This Summer Downtown Has Not One, But Four Outdoor Movie Series by Richard GuzmánCity Editor Los Angeles Downtown News  |  0comments  DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - When it comes to enjoying a night at the movies in Downtown Los Angeles, people don’t have to put up with the confines of four walls, a roof and paying $6 for a small popcorn. This summer, Downtown movie fans can take advantage of four outdoor movie series. The events offer everything from classics to comedies to family friendly fare. Some even throw live music and food trucks into the mix, and one series is free. Here is a rundown of the al fresco film action. Friday Flicks The granddaddy of the Downtown outdoor film scene is at Pershing Square , where the free Friday Night Flicks series has been going on since 2008. This year’s lineup launched May 3 and continues through October with more than 25 films.  So far only the lineup through June 28 has been announced. The month of May features 1980s flashback movies. On May 17 the 1985 comedy-drama Desperately Seeking Susan will run. Screening May 24 is John Hughes’ 1986 comedy Pretty in Pink , starring a young Molly Ringwald. It also features Jon Cryer, Andrew McCarthy, James Spader and even Andrew “Dice” Clay. The following week is a further flashback, all the way to 1950s, thanks to Michael J. Fox and the time-traveling DeLorean in Back to the Future . The vibe changes in June with what park officials tout as “camp” films. That’s wacky camp, not summer camp. There is also plenty of music in movies including The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert , about two drag queens and a transsexual who get a gig in the desert. It screens June 14. The John Travolta-Olivia Newton John classic Grease is on June 21. Films at Pershing Square are shown on a 40-by-20-foot inflatable screen and Downtowners are invited to bring a blanket, lawn chair and picnic baskets . Movies start at 8 p.m. and dogs are welcome, as long as they are on a leash and don’t sing too loud during “You’re the One That I Want.”          Pershing Square is at 533 S. Olive St., (213) 847-4970 or laparks.org/pershingsquare . Park and View It seemed the credits were set to roll last summer when Morgan Night announced he would shut down the Devil’s Night Drive-In, which had taken place for seven years on a roof at Fourth Street and Broadway . The series did end, but like all those zombies that the kids love these days, it was soon reborn after being purchased. It was renamed the Electric Dusk Drive-In. Then, unlike the zombies, it was forced to move to the Fashion District. Now Electric Dusk runs at City Market of Los Angeles, an old produce warehouse complex. “It’s great, we’re really liking it,” said drive-in owner Eric Heusinger of their new, bigger location, where they can hold 110 cars, up from the previous 80. The summer season is sporadic, though films are usually shown on the weekends through Aug. 31. They range from classics to action to cult hits and mostly run at 8 p.m. The screen is 24-by-18 foot. The next installment is May 26 with the 1950 All About Eve , which stars Bette Davis and won six Oscars. Things are completely different June 9 with the 1995 comedy To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar . It features Wesley Snipes, John Leguizamo and Patrick Swayze as drag queens traveling across the country. They end up stranded in a small town and wackiness ensues. A good time to take the family to the drive-in will be July 13, when The Princess Bride is on screen, and July 27 when E.T. finds his way to Downtown. The closing film, on Aug. 31, is Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo . Although the Electric Dusk Drive-In is a drive-in, a car is not a requirement. An Astroturf area has room for about 225 people. There is also a snack shack selling hot dogs, burgers and drinks.          At 1000 San Julian St., (818) 653-8591 or electricduskdrivein.com . Street Style  The Street Food Cinema combines three things most people love: food trucks, music and movies. The venue-hopping series returns for its second year, running May 25-Sept. 21. The majority of the weekly films take place at Exposition Park. Other Downtown locations include Grand Hope Park and Los Angeles State Historic Park. “Exposition Park is kind of our home base, but we love Downtown,” said Heather Hope-Allison, one of the event producers. “We’ll be at Grand Hope Park for Family Night.” Doors open at 5:30 p.m. for every event. There is lawn seating for nearly 1,800 people (bring your own lawn chairs and blankets). There are also usually more than a dozen food trucks. A live band performs at 6:30 p.m. and the movie starts at 8 p.m. The season begins May 25 with the coming of age hit Stand by Me at Exposition Park. For fans of Corey Feldman (stop laughing), the night will be a double treat, since the actor is also the opening act and will be performing with his band. On June 1, Tom Cruise dances in his underwear in 1983’s Risky Business . It also screens at Exposition Park. As Hope-Allison noted, it’s family time at Grand Hope Park in South Park on June 8, with the animated Escape From Planet Earth .  Update : From Aug. 3 to Sept. 14 Street Food Cinema will also host free family-friendly films every Saturday at Grand Park in the Civic Center. The series shifts to Los Angeles State Historic Park on July 27 with the absurd comedy Monty Python &amp; The Holy Grail . Another highlight is Skyfall , with the blond Bond back at Exposition Park Aug. 17.The Street Food Cinema is also dog friendly.          Exposition Park is at 700 Exposition Park Drive. Los Angeles State Historic Park is at 1245 N. Spring St. Grand Hope Park is at 919 S. Grand Ave. At streetfoodcinema.com . Hear It, See It, Eat It The directions are pretty clear at the festival sponsored by cable channel Showtime. The Eat See Hear series runs May 11-Sept. 14. Eight of the films in the Saturday series will be in Downtown at either Los Angeles State Historic Park, where people can sit on the grass, or in a drive-in on the rooftop of a parking lot at the Los Angeles Trade Tech College at Flower Street just south of Washington Boulevard. “We want to marry the three quintessential L.A. things,” said Sharon Sperber, co-owner and co-producer of the series, referring to the mix of movies, food and music. The movies are projected on a three-and-a-half story tall, 52-foot-wide screen. Events start at 5:30 p.m. with food trucks, the bands play at 7 p.m. and the movies start at 8:30 p.m. Coming to Trade Tech May 18 is Seth MacFarlane’s comedy Ted . Although the movie is about a cute talking teddy bear, this is not for kids. Consider yourself warned. The next Downtown event is June 15 at the State Park with the bloody Brad Pitt action thriller Fight Club . Risky Business gets another local screening on June 29 at Trade Tech and Bill Murray’s Stripes plays a week later at the State Park. Downtown is also home to the final event, with Molly Ringwald (again!) as part of the Brat Pack cast of The Breakfast Club at the park on Sept. 14.            L.A. State Historic Park is at 1245 N. Spring St. L.A. Trade Tech is at Flower and W. 22nd streets or eatseehear.com .          Contact Richard Guzmán at richard@downtownnews.com .     ©Los Angeles Downtown News.   More about Movies ARTICLE : The Outfit Action IMAGE : The Outfit Action More about Exposition Park ARTICLE : CicLAvia Rolls in to Downtown This Weekend [if IE 6]> <link media="screen" href="http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/ladowntownnews.com/content/tncms/live/components/core_social_share/resources/styles/social_share_ie6.css?_dc=1375270355" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> <![endif]  Discuss Print  Posted in Arts and entertainment  on  Friday, May 17, 2013 5:00 am.
