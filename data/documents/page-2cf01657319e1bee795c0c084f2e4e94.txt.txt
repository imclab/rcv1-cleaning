Read on to learn more about the opportunities in this field. Inside Studio Art Studio art, also called fine art, is traditionally defined as art that is enjoyed visually, such as photographs, paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures or ceramics. Earning a studio arts degree hones your creative skills and allows you to create your work and sell it to galleries, museums or individuals. You can also use these skills to teach art or work in a commercial field, such as graphic arts or advertising. Several degrees in studio art are available. Community colleges offer associate degree programs that lead either to employment or transfer to a 4-year program. You can also get a bachelor's, master's or doctoral degree in fine art focusing on hands-on studio experience. Students generally concentrate in one or two media and build a portfolio during the course of their studies. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) stated that demand for artists and related workers was expected to grow by 12% from 2008-2018 ( www.bls.gov ). Fine artists, who include sculptors, painters and illustrators, were expected to see nine percent growth during that same period. In May 2010, the middle half of fine artists earned $29,440-$65,420. The average annual salary during this same period was $53,080. Competition is fierce in art careers, but prospects are greater for talented artists who are willing to work in a variety of environments.
