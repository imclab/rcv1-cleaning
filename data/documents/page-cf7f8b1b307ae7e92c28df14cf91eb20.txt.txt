 Miley Cyrus and The VMA Awards 
 
 
 Dr. Peggy Drexler 
 Author, research psychologist and gender scholar 
 What's different about Cyrus's performance, which seems to have generated an unprecedented level of outrage, is not its by-now old-hat hypersexuality but its particular seaminess. Cyrus was sexual, de rigueur in pop performances, but also more than a little repelling.
