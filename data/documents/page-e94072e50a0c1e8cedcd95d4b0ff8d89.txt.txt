By vikpau Payday loans uk Save Money. Worry Less. The Animal Health Alliance is a pet insurance alternative. We are not insurance. AHA members save money when they receive care from veterinary clinics that participate in our program. Compare Pet Insurances to AHA Membership Pet insurance seems to be a solution. However, the high cost of premiums, health exclusions on pre-existing conditions (pets that need it most), waiting periods, and high deductibles, all prevent many pet owners from purchasing coverage. Not to mention the least favorite part: time consuming paper work, the &#8220;pay first, get refunded later&#8221; nature of most policies. Economic euthanasia is on the rise because many owners have not planned ahead. Don&#8217;t find yourself faced with an unforeseen financial pet care crisis. As an AHA Member: No Animal Left Behind.
