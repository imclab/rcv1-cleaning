The site began back in 2006 when we developed the first informative website to cater for convertible car buyers and owners. From a technical perspective the first site was purely produced in HTML - the basic building blocks of the internet. It was versatile but high maintenance. Later we used the Blogger service to allow our news to be organised efficiently and allow readers to make comments on what was written. This remains a great service for smaller websites but as Convertible Car Magazine has grown our needs have too. The website now receives thousands of visitors from around the world every day so we wanted to give them the best experience possible. The new site is run on the Wordpress system with use of new features such as custom post types and custom fields that all allow us to keep it up to date more quickly and easily than before. For the average reader all this means that you will get a better website that looks great and is updated more regularly. This year we plan to develop the site further adding more videos and reviews as well as providing you with the latest news and of course our famous buyer's guide. From now on all news will be found here on the main site . at 25.4.11 0reader comments &#160;  Links to this post Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom) Convertible Car Magazine News Archive &#9660;&#160; 2011 (1) &#9660;&#160; April (1) Convertible Car Magazine News has moved  News Feed Subscribe to our feed  Older Archives Visit our old news archive where you can view all news on convertible cars since the site began. 2007: &gt; July Archive &gt; June Archive &gt; May Archive &gt; March Archive &gt; February Archive &gt; January Archive 2006: &gt; December Archive &gt; November Archive &gt; October Archive &gt; September Archive &gt; August Archive &gt; July Archive &gt; June Archive  Wallpaper &#160;  Convertible Car Magazine 2006 - 2011 | Phoot Creative Graphic Design | Convertibles, roadsters, cabriolets & convertible cars
