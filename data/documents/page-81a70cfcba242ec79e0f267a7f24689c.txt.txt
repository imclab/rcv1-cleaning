Posted: Friday, August 31, 2012 12:52 pm Humor, horror blend in film night By Stacy Trevenon [ stacy@hmbreview.com ] Half Moon Bay Review   |  0comments  Humor and horror meet face to face in the next Coastside Film Society outing scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Friday, Aug. 31, in Half Moon Bay. But the two films set to be screened that night — a five-minute short and 93-minute feature — also balance each other out for an unforgettable night of film. The short “The Bicycle” starts when a dastardly thief grabs a bike and a hilarious chase ensues. The film, a silent short, was made by 20-year-old Bay Area artist Johnny Villar and won the 2011 College of San Mateo Film Festival. Its trademark is its unique suburban visual style and over-the-top performances are meant to appeal to those who like the films of Chaplin and Keaton, or humor with an edge of menace. The 1955 feature “The Night of the Hunter” was not a hit initially, but is called “one of the greatest of all American films. Compelling, frightening and beautiful” by Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times. The first and only directorial effort of British actor Charles Laughton, the 1955 was considered dark for its time. But by the mid-1960s it had become a film-noir cult favorite, and is now hailed as one of the greatest examples of the genre. Robert Mitchum plays crazed preacher Harry Powell, who marries and murders widows for their money. Shelley Winters plays one such widow Willa, his intended next victim … except that only her children know where their father stashed his loot. And enter Lillian Gish as indomitable Scripture-spouting welfare worker Rachel Cooper, as determined to save the children as the preacher is to dominate them. Its use of techniques that 1950s audiences were not ready to handle led to the film’s initial flop, but when the film was pondered by the local film society, its organizers wondered why they had not screened the film before and then debated what to pair with it, wrote film society staff in a publicity statement. Then the staff discovered Villar’s award-winning “Bicycle,” which stars himself as the thief and his little brother as the victim who fights back, and named the short as the “perfect counterpoint,” according to the publicity statement. The feature will be introduced by Villar, who will also warn off bringing young children to the screening. The Film Night will take place at the Community United Methodist Church at 777 Miramontes St. in Half Moon Bay. Admission is an $8 donation. For information visit www.hmbfilm.org .
