The team behind the surf documentary, "Dark Fall," has returned with an animated short, titled "Bernie and Ges." During the first episode, surfer Gesler, 28, and his tuxedo-wearing, talking dog, Bernie, have to save southern New Jersey from a zombie invasion. The episode will premiere on Saturday in the Music Hall at the House of Blues Atlantic City inside the Showboat Casino-Hotel. "I thought it would be a cool idea to do a cartoon based on Andrew and his dog and his fiancee, because if you have ever been to his house, it's sort of like a cartoon. The dog is always doing something. He is always up to no good, most of the time," said DePhillipo, 26, who added Bernie, a rescued dog, was not trained when he first met him. "He (Andrew) would always come home to food on the floor. The dog rolling around in dead animals. I just thought it would be a funny idea. Andrew was into it." Gesler and his fiancee, Jeannine Petro, 26, of Ocean City, rescued Bernie, a boxer, pit bull and miniature bull-terrier mix, two years ago when he was only months old. "He does funny stuff. This cartoon is just an extension of the character he already is," Gesler said. DePhillipo and Gesler approached Don Marrandino, Caesars Entertainment eastern division president, and Paul Pallitto, senior customer development executive at Bally's Atlantic City, for help. Marrandino helped make "Dark Fall" happen. With Marrandino's and Pallitto's involvement, DePhillipo and Gesler were able to convince Drew Toonz, of Brigantine - who DePhillipo characterizes as "beyond genius" - to come back from Hawaii and animate their project. "We really wanted to do something different than the average surf video... It's a no brainer that we would we would hook up with (Toonz) and try to bring some comedy into the surf industry," said DePhillipo. This project was created in less than three months. Toonz spent nine to 12 hours per day animating the piece. Voices heard in the cartoon include Gesler and Petro as themselves and Mike Anthony, of Blackwood, Camden County, who voices the hipster dog, Bernie. The episode lasts 21 minutes and is not completely animated. Surfing footage, shot by DePhillipo in Ocean City and Atlantic City, is included. The short already has been accepted into the New York Surf Film Festival next month. "Bernie and Ges" is unrated, but its content would merit a PG-13 rating because of language and cartoon violence. "If you came to the 'Dark Fall' premiere (in 2010), you had a really good time. It didn't matter what was on the screen," DePhillipo said. "You will see local talent do their thing. Everyone comes to see these acts from out of town. I think it's cool when you know everyone at these things."
