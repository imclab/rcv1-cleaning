That's certainly true for King Henry II and his family. Getting together for Christmas, they deal with murderousintentions, nasty temperaments, disowning one's children - you namethe dysfunction, this family in "The Lion in Winter" has it. Winding Road Theatre Ensemble opened a solid production of theJames Goldman play last weekend, quite effectively turning thealtar and center of Christ Presbyterian Church into a castle inFrance in 1183. The scene is this: The king has let his wife, Eleanor ofAquitaine, out of prison for the holidays. He greets her with theirthree sons and his mistress in tow. Each son is grasping for power.His mistress, Alais, has a bit of trouble with Eleanor's presence.Henry is getting old - 50! - and longs to put his affairs in order,but is getting no cooperation from anyone. Terry Erbe's Henry has a booming voice, an easy humor and anoften heartless attitude. He and Lesley Abrams as Eleanor play offeach other beautifully, one moment flirting, the next hurlingcontempt at one another. They are the heart of this play, and theykept it beating fast. Amy Erbe's Alais is a quietly conniving woman who knows justwhat to do to keep Henry interested in her. The three sons are not well-drawn characters, but director GlenCoffman and the actors still managed to give them definition andpersonality. Paul Matlock was a hoot as the cowardly baby of thefamily, John. Steve Wood's middle child, Geoffrey, was a mastermanipulator. And Christopher Johnson as Richard, the most masterfuland macho of the three boys, wrapped himself in arrogance, allowinga touch of vulnerability to appear just once. But it was enough tohumanize the character and give us a glimpse of him as somethingother than a power-hungry warrior. Nick Trice was fierce in his small but well-executed role as theking of France. Coffman's direction seemed a bit staid at times, and the pacingwas off at the Saturday night performance. But mostly thisproduction flowed with humor and solid storytelling. These days, it's hard to laugh at a dysfunctional family whosemembers plot to kill and destroy one another. But there was alightness to this production that kept it from becoming too maudlin- and making it one that should be seen.
