Item Details Feedback (99) Shipping &amp; Policies  Hi there! Thanks for stopping by my shop! CUSTOM ORDER WILL SHIP IN ONLY 3 WEEKS! I am offering a very trendy car seat cover for sale.THIS ONE IS FOR THE ORANGE AND CAMO WITH THE DEER HEAD AND YOUR CHILD&#39;S NAME I CAN ALSO MAKE IT WITH ANOTHER COLOR INSTEAD OF ORANGE AND I CAN CHANGE THE THREAD COLOR OF THE DEER AND THE BABY NAME. YOU CHOOSE! This car seat cover easily slips on your existing car seat cover. It has nine pre-sewn holes for a five point harness so you can just pull the straps through. It is encased in elastic all around so that it will fit snug. It is displayed on a Cosco Scenera convertible seat and will only fit those that are similiar to this one. It will not fit any seat that has arm rests or cup holders. I will also embroider your baby&#39;s name on the front with an adorable font in the color of your choice. If you have any specific fabric patterns you would like, please let me know and I will try to accomodate you. Thank you!
