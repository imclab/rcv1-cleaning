"We saw just a mass amount of people coming out and having a great time and staying out too. Our restaurant was full, every table," said Zachary Mayhall,manager at "Sam and Greg&#39;s. There&#39;s no denying that the entertainment districts are good for business. Mayhall said he knows thatfirsthand, "This past Thursday was our record breaking day, the most money we&#39;ve made in a single day." But now the question is: will the momentum remain?Mayhall said there&#39;s no doubt it will. "I certainly think we can. I think this is only the beginning. It&#39;s only going to get bigger. Without a doubt," said Mayhall. Mayhall said hebelieves the key to keeping the districts fresh will depend on the ability to grow "I think we should try and make it grow and have more local artists, more people coming out to buy art," he said. "It&#39;s really cool to see things start to take off and grow and a bigger demand for live music and art sold on the street corner. It just feels like the community is really coming together," said Mayhall. Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle said in 90 days they willtake a look at the district and see if any changes need to be made.
