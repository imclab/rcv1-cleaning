Nestling a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged flat six-cylinder engine behind its wider rear hips – a further 28mm wider than the already-widened body of the Carrera 4 models – the Turbo produces 383kW, up from 368kW with the previous model, and the Turbo S a fuller 412kW, up from 390kW. Torque outputs are not yet revealed. This generation of Porsche 911 Turbo models employ only a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, a move that follows the track-focused naturally aspirated 911 GT3 revealed earlier this year. Together with a new Porsche Traction Management (PTM) all-wheel-drive system, active rear axle steering, adaptive aerodynamics, the Turbo gets to 100km/h in 3.2 seconds when optioned with the Sport Chrono Package Plus. That pack is standard on the Turbo S, which slices a further tenth of the time. The top speed of the 911 Turbo S is 318km/h, and the car wearing standard production tyres is claimed to have lapped the Nurburgring in &#8220;well under&#8221; seven minutes and 30 seconds. Fuel consumption reductions of up to 16 per cent have been achieved, with both the 911 Turbo and Turbo S claimed to consume 9.7L/100km combined. An auto stop-start function is standard on both models, which now shuts off the engine during coasting to a stop, in addition to decoupling the transmission when cruising off the throttle. Porsche claims its new all-wheel-drive system delivers &#8220;faster and more precise power distribution to the two axles&#8221;. It has electronically controlled and activated multi-plate coupling and, for the first time, a new water cooling function aimed to direct more power to the front wheels than before, where necessary. Porsche also claims that it continues to be the only manufacturer to offer two turbochargers in a petrol engine, both of which have variable turbine geometry. The chassis of both Turbo models is 100mm longer than regular Porsche 911 models, with 20-inch wheels standard and an active anti-roll bar system optional on Turbo and standard on Turbo S as part of the Sport Chrono Package, which also includes dynamic engine mounts and ceramic brakes. Both models introduce the rear steering first shown on the 911 GT3. Angle of the rear wheels can be varied up to 2.8 degrees depending on vehicle speed. At up to 50km/h, the rear wheels move in the opposite direction the front wheels are turned to &#8216;virtually&#8217; shorten the wheelbase by 250mm and increase agility, according to Porsche. Conversely, above 80km/h, the rear wheels turn in parallel with the fronts to &#8216;virtually&#8217; lengthen the wheelbase by 500mm allowing &#8220;tremendous stability&#8221;. Active aerodynamic features standard on both 911 Turbo and Turbo S include a three-stage retractable front spoiler, an adjustable rear wing with three set positions. At the rear wing&#8217;s maximum height, downforce on the rear wheels is claimed to improve to such an extent that the feature alone helped shave two seconds of the Turbo S model&#8217;s Nurburgring circuit time. While obviously based on the regular Porsche 911 models, the Turbo and Turbo S get mildly enhanced interiors, with standard Bose audio and an optional Burmester system. Radar-controlled cruise control, camera-based road sign and speed limit recognition are being offered for the first time. The Porsche 911 Turbo and Turbo S models are due in Australia late in 2013, priced from around $360-430K.  Tweet  Zaccy16 Best porsche ever in my opinion, that 0-100 time is very impressive, also for the amount of power it produces the fuel consumption is very impressive, the interior is a masterpiece delcotexas agreed John The last one did 0-100 in 2.6. Porsche love understating their performance figures. Expect this to do the same. Deal with it&#8230; What??? No Manual??? (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻. Seriously though, the only way a modern supercar should have a manuel is if the dealer was throwing in a free box set of Fawlty Towers&#8230; Jim One of the best value super cars in the world. John At half a million dollars, I don&#8217;t think so. The GTR is the best value supercar in the world. Jason Bourne I agree. There are other aspects in which this car is better than the GTR, but not value for money. No doubt Nissan will be getting a few units ASAP for their engineers to test and benchmark. JooberJCW Wait until its lapped the ring first. It has be as good as the GT2 RS to beat the current GTR al He said &#8220;ONE of the best value super cars&#8221;. Do you have a problem with basic comprehension? Jj57855 &#8216;One of the best value super cars&#8217; implies that the that the 911 is in a similar league as a Nissan GTR in terms of value for money. While I agree that the 911 is a great car, it is not 2.5 times the car the GTR is, so I think John&#8217;s point is valid.  Tom Don&#8217;t like the centre console on this (looks great on the Panamera), dont like the seats (and thank god that color scheme is optional) and those wheels look like they came from Bob Jane. As to the rest of it, im going to need to warm to it&#8230; First 911 ever that im not sure on&#8230; lolol this guy above me has no idea! fanboi1 Good job that&#8217;s quicker than the GTR. They&#8217;ve finally did it. Nathan GTR does 0-100 in 2.7s. This car does 3.2s and the S does 3.1s. Last time I checked 2.7 is faster than 3.2 and 3.1. steve That&#8217;s a claim I keep hearing from GTR fanbois but have never seen an independent test to prove the Nissan can go sub 3.0 secs. The old models 911 Turbo can and in fact an aussie website tested them both head to head last year and the 911 won the 0-100km/h sprint. This new version is faster again. Carlos Over here Motor trend did a test recently between the 2013 GTR Black Edition vs 2012 911Turbo S. The Porsche accelerates faster. Porsche are famous for understating their performance figures whereas Nissan are notorious for exaggerating. But some people refuse to believe facts because they don&#8217;t like the truth. http://www.facebook.com/Nickyenzo  Alberga Dickenson Every body talks about GTR price like really if I was rich I wouldn&#8217;t take a GTR over this 991 Turbo! And a brand new GTR isn&#8217;t cheap ether over 100k. But of your a person with good credit and have some cash on the side yeah u can get a 2009-2010 GTR for maybe around 60-70k so it could work out. But if u have the money no way I take a gtr over 991 Turbo or 991 gt3. And GTR isn&#8217;t the best bang for the buck its a ZR-1! http://www.facebook.com/Nickyenzo  Alberga Dickenson Anyway I think the Gt3 looks better! Phil &#8220;Only maker with twin turbo petrol&#8221;, what about BMW&#8217;s N63 and S63? The TT V12 in the SL65 AMG? Nissan GTR? Not to mention the upcoming Cadillac CTS Vsport, and the Maserati Quattroporte? Car maker PR depts can be myopic, but that level of ignorance is inexcusable. http://www.facebook.com/alexander.sambuco  Alexander Sambuco I think they are saying they are the only maker with twin variable vane turbos. I think the TT in the BMW are sequential non variable vane turbos aand the Merc has one non variable vane turbo per bank. Wile E My how autos have come a long way. http://www.facebook.com/alexander.sambuco  Alexander Sambuco It is interesting how Porsche develop a 7 speed manual then don&#8217;t use it in the GT3 and Turbo/S JamesB Yeah, those were my thoughts exactly. It should have cost them a ton of money to get a seventh gear in a manual, possibly a world-first. Now it seems rather pointless if the stick won&#8217;t go into flagship models. Exar Kun Haunches are just too big for my liking. The GT3 looks better IMO. Fantastic performance though. A 911T-S for daily for long trips and then a GT3 RS for Sunday drive and trackwork would be a pretty compelling combo. But they really need to get the sequential shifter action the right way around (I know it is in the GT3). Back for up gears and forwards for down gears. Unless they&#8217;ve done that now and the image of the gear pattern on the instrument display is wrong. Josh Kong Rear Hips remind me of those RWB porsches, beautifully sculpted lines. However I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s enough distinction and aggression in the front end.
