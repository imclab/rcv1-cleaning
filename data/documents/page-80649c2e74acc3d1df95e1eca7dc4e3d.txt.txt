You really love to paint your models flat black this year... I received my ScaleProduction Decals last week. Great stuff, high precision print, almost no flash around the individual decals. Oh... and somebody told me that the SP carbon decals are now printed by Cartograph! :ylsuper: I'm going to build the Fujimi Z4 GT3 in DÃ¶rr livery. sportracer02 07-05-2012, 05:23 AM Nice start, Frank, interesting livery I guess youÂ´ll change the wheels of the diecast ? John18d 07-05-2012, 05:32 AM Sorry Frank didn't know what schuco was - we don't get those diecast here in the USA that I know of. I have two of the Fujimi Z4s but I like the venting on the schuco diecast better. Thank you for clarifying things for me. You guys in Europe and Germany get some really cool slot car and diecast racing cars. - here in the USA it's all NASCAR - John FraFi 07-05-2012, 06:27 AM @Micha, the SaarlÃ¤nder send me 4 odl BBS-rims. look at the 1st post (photo with the painted Body. @Sebastian, the Z4 GT3 is full-carbon :smooch: not JUST flat-black cars :smooch: @John ah OK. i think all knows the SCHUCO Z4.

Planned to fix it all and cast in resin (think is easyer to work) but never found a livery giving me the correct &quot;inspiration&quot;, as the nice ones with new z4s.

Where you find this resin body ??? :dunno: I tried to find a place where I can buy the schuco BMW M Coupe diecast, but I hadn't success. :crying: My only alternative is the GoodSmile option, they have one resin kit of this car by 12000 yens, but it is only sold on japanese market. I received my Dorr BMW Z4 GT3 decal sheet (very good printing !!!!), and I loved the option to make the BMW M Coupe too... FraFi 08-18-2012, 12:34 AM Mike...

John18d 09-08-2012, 09:35 AM Hi Fellow forum members - just a quick note -For anyone doing a GT3 BMW Z4 - I think the Fujimi kit tires are wrong - oversized&quot; in outside diameter because they are just copies of the Porsche GT3R tires - I recently received an order from Mike at Scale Productions and bought a set of his black 18&quot; BBS GT3R/RSR wheels with tires - his tires are just a little smaller in outside diameter and look much better with a trial fit. For anyone considering a BMW GT3 Z4 they are well worth the price and will make the build look much better than what the box Fujimi wheels and tires do. Thanks again to Mike - he really makes some nice quality parts at a reasonable price - John FraFi 09-11-2012, 05:35 AM Hi, 1st One ist finished yesterday: http://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZUcJ-fAYiNI/UE8TgYYEezI/AAAAAAAAAe0/-d2w418TnOI/s800/PICT0115.JPG more Pictures at the weekend.
