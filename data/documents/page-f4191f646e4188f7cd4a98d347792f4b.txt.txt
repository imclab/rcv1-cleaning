Back to Entertainment : Humor A Parent's Guide to Body Art by Donna Cavanagh &#8226; Guest Writer { View Profile }  Photograph: Photo by iStock. Last week, my daughter and I were chatting in the hot tub when she brought up the topic of tattoos.At first, I thought I didn&rsquo;t hear her correctly since the water was bubbling in my ears, so I sat up straight. &ldquo;What?Did you say tattoos&mdash;on you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not me!Good God, Mother, I know your feelings on me getting inked!&rdquo; Yes, my daughter knows I do not approve of her getting a tattoo. In fact, it is more than a disapproval; I have a signed contract that says she can&rsquo;t have a tattoo. Yes, you read that right. This legal contract was the best parental victory of my life. This is how it came to be. Picture it:a 15-year-old girl eyeing sparkly belly-button rings in the jewelry store at the Jersey shore.She turns to me and says, &ldquo;Mom, I really want my belly button pierced. Can&rsquo;t you talk to Dad and get him to say okay?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, if you would show a little more enthusiasm with school this coming year, I could probably get Daddy to go along with it, but I am talking First Honors &ndash; and no detentions. And maybe then for your 16 th birthday, we can see.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can do that,&rdquo; she assured me. &ldquo;No detentions! Did you hear that part?&rdquo; I reiterated. I had to reiterate that part because, frankly, my daughter was the queen of detentions.I can&rsquo;t remember a year, including Pre-K, where she did not have to sit for at least one detention.In her defense, her detentions were mostly due to her propensity to disagree vocally with school protocol.She wasn&rsquo;t disrespectful&mdash;just opinionated. For the record, I have no idea where she gets this trait. It must be from her father&rsquo;s side. Anyway, when her 16 th birthday came around, she reminded me of my promise of the belly-button piercing.I said I would check with her father, who I thought would be a stand-up guy and say no way, but he didn&rsquo;t.I stood there with my mouth open in shock as he gave his approval. &ldquo;You are going to let them put a hole in my baby&rsquo;s belly? Look at that belly!&rdquo; I yelled as I threw her baby book in his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a belly button. Would you rather her get her tongue or nipple pierced?&rdquo; The thought of either of those things made me want to throw up, so I relented&mdash;not happily, but I did.What I was not prepared for was that I had to go with her and watch some stranger put a hole through her perfect little belly button.It had to be me because my husband passes out whenever any kind of needle comes near a human body.His fear of needles was part of the reason why I went drug free during childbirth. Yes, no drugs made the whole labor process difficult, but I have to admit that the mileage I have gotten from that guilt trip turned out to be better than I could have ever imagined, so the pain was well worth it. Anyway, I made inquiries as to the best place to get this belly-button procedure done. Another mom recommended a studio called World of Body Art. She could attest that the artists at this facility were both talented and hygienic. So, I made an appointment and there we met &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; who explained how he would pierce my baby&rsquo;s belly&mdash;that cute little belly that I kissed and rubbed with baby lotion in an effort to keep it so soft and rash-free. At first I didn&rsquo;t like Joe. He looked like a bigger version of Willie Nelson with lots of piercings and tattoos. His office had pictures of all the body parts that one can pierce. As I stared at this walking work of inked art, I have to admit that I was comforted to see so much jewelry pinned to his body because it showed me he believed in his profession even though he did sort of look like he&rsquo;d spent too many years hanging out with the Hell&rsquo;s Angels.I am not trying to insult that fine upstanding motorcycle club in any way, but I think even they might admit that some of their members have a tendency to go overboard on the body painting. 1 2 next › last » What’s your reaction?
