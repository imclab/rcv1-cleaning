Followers        Thursday, March 21, 2013 Akon Distracted Fans to Help Michael Jackson Singer songwriter Akon once helped Michael Jackson enjoy a movie in peace by distracting fans. R&amp;B singer Akon once acted as a distraction for fans during a trip to a movie theatre with Michael Jackson because nobody recognised the King of Pop in his disguise. The Smack That hitmaker collaborated with the Thriller legend in 2007, and he has fond memories of their time together - particularly because the icon loved to play tricks on fans. Recalling one trip to a local cinema, Akon tellsCNN.com, "We snuck off to go to the movies, he had a disguise on. It was me and his three kids and we were on the escalator and the people were like 'Akon, oh my God, Akon,' and I am signing autographs and laughing, thinking, 'You don't even know who is beside me' - the whole time, he is standing there laughing." Akon's duet with Jackson, Hold My Hand, wasn't completed until after the singer's tragic 2009 death and became the first posthumous release from his album Michael.

MJ wanted to be an inbred so badly that he turned himself into a porcelain looking piece of shit March 21, 2013 at 8:33 AM Anonymoussaid... and you couldn&#39;t wait to say something bad about Michael because you are a piece of shit March 21, 2013 at 8:51 PM Anonymoussaid... Let the man rest in peace. Damn..! March 21, 2013 at 10:07 PM Anonymoussaid... 8:51 That troll is always on a post about MJ saying negative things about him. Obsessed much? Yet, will make every excuse in the world for that bleached out demonic whore she worships. People call that dumbass ho out on her crap, and this psycho bitch is the main one there to defend the witch. March 22, 2013 at 7:59 AM Anonymoussaid... ^^ I know you guys weren&#39;t alive in the 80s when MJ was a cute black man.OMG! Then he decided to transform himself into something that resembled a walking corpse, then op to create 3 test tubes in his laboratory. March 22, 2013 at 9:10 AM Anonymoussaid... ^^^WTF is it to you what MJ did with his appearance or his life? Get a life. Been a fan for most of my life and can very well recall how he looked during the Off the Wall era. Makes no difference to me. Concern yourself about the witch being on her third nose job and the bleaching seems to be ongoing. Oh and worshipping a demon is hardly the way to go. Rather crazy actually. March 22, 2013 at 5:16 PM Anonymoussaid... 5:16 you wanna dig MJ up &amp; suck his dick don&#39;t you? Well he won&#39;t let you, not even in death. Cause he hated black people. How many times do I have to tell you that?. You weren&#39;t alive in 1978. When that album came out. I think it was 78 or 79. All celebs get nose Jobs, bey is not bleaching. I wish I was blue ivy. I want Bey for a mom . She is sooooo COOL!! &amp; I don&#39;t worship human beings. I worship God. March 22, 2013 at 9:05 PM Anonymoussaid... 9:05 Like your &quot;god&quot;, you lack class. You don&#39;t know a damn thing about MJ. How often do I have to repeat that? LOL. Now, you know when I was born? Bitch, please. You, like your stupid ass idol, are so full of yourself. You wishin to be this whore&#39;s test tube &#39;baby&#39; says a lot about you. You are obviously not happy with your life. Stains cannot stand logic. You idiots always conjure up some ILLOGICAL response. And since you went there.....with the way you patrol comments about beyahomet, it is safe to say if she dosn&#39;t like bathing stains like you will keep it clean for her. Back to worshipping your god and remaining in denial about the hoe bleaching. March 23, 2013 at 7:28 AM Anonymoussaid... My keyboard letters are sticking. That is &quot;if she doesn&#39;t&quot; I forgot one thing: You are so pro Black, Black this and the almighty that when you speak of MJ. But, when it comes to the hoe, you back down and make excuses. Now, it&#39;s &quot;all celebs ge nose jobs&quot;. Why would you be ok with anyone removing any of their afrocentric features? Shame on MJ, but ok for beyaki? Hypocrite. March 23, 2013 at 7:35 AM Anonymoussaid... 7:28,7:35 I know a lot about MJ, My mom &amp; I used to hang outside of the Jackson 5 hotels in the 70&#39;s when I was a little girl. (I&#39;m 6 years younger than MJ). there was nothing but a mob of BLACK people. Whites didn&#39;t start getting obsessed with MJ til the 80s (White girls were into ANDY GIBB in the late 70s) They would come out of their Hotel &amp; run to their limo, I went to see them at the Astrodome. It was fun when it was just blacks into him because it was sooooooo easy to go see the Jackson 5 anywhere. Then when white girls discovered MJ, they ruined everything. MJ started catering to a white audience &amp; kicked his black fans to the curb. Everything was about white girls &amp; pleasing them. Back then black women could enjoy the black singers. cause white girls liked white singers then. In the 70sMarvin Gaye crooned to black girls, never a white one. Now this black man white girl shit is out of control. Then in 1987 he changed his skin color, he was black in 1985. We didn&#39;t see him at all in 1986. It was all over the news that MJ was premiering his new song &quot;Bad&quot; so everyone was excited sitting in front of the t.v. Then when the video started, It was like WTF!!! echoed in every household. I am not pro black, I am anti inbred. I am prejudice against inbreds ONLY. I have no problem with any other race In most case scenarios, its mandatory for celebs to get nose jobs,. otherwise they can&#39;t make it in show biz . They wouldn&#39;t get any work. I don&#39;t agree with it, thats just the way it is. Lastly, I would never call any celeb my idol, I don&#39;t have an idol. To have an idol is against GOD. I am a Bey fan.... March 23, 2013 at 1:23 PM Anonymoussaid... Marvin Gaye crooned to whoever listened to him. His music like MJ is universal and has a message. What&#39;s going on is a song anyone (black or white) can listen to. You hanging outside of his hotel room back in the day and attending concerts does not make you an expert about MJ. You only know OF the man. You don&#39;t KNOW him. Just because MJ became more mainstream doesn&#39;t mean he &quot;kicked black people to the curb&quot;. SMH. You have Beyaki yodeling &quot;You ought to know&quot; a song by Alanis Morrisette trying to capture that mainstream audience. Does that mean she is kicking you guys to the curb? She teams up with Lady GaGa, Shakira etc (damn near anyone)in attempts to have a more cross over appeal. You don&#39;t seem to have a problem with that. MJ cannot help who liked him and didn&#39;t care about their ethnicity, or color. They are simply fans. Just because there was an all black mob at the time doesn&#39;t mean it was going stay that way. Sam Cooke had/has white fans to this day. Yeah, &quot;it just the way it is&quot; regarding black celebs having nose jobs when it is obvious that bey has had the job done several times. You simply cannot deny that she has had her nose done so now it is just the way it is. Sure. March 23, 2013 at 3:17 PM Anonymoussaid... 3:17 If you believe MJ didn&#39;t have a problem with his skin color or his race, you are sadly misguided. I don&#39;t know how to explain to you what i mean about blacks being able to enjoy black singers back then. Cause you won&#39;t listen to what I&#39;m telling you. You already have your mind made up. It was a different time white women weren&#39;t invading the black womans turf. They swooned over white singers back then. I know singers have all races of people that enjoy their music. What i am trying to say to you is, MJ was on a different level than any other singers. &amp; he chose to shut his black fans out. He could have continued to embrace his black fans because He was waaayyyy on top, but he didn&#39;t show his love for us. He didn&#39;t want us anymore. white girls discovered him during his finally years with his brothers. The final Tour with his brothers. The tickets got jacked up so high, most black people couldn&#39;t afford them. Black people were on t.v. crying cause the only people that could mainly afford tickets were RICH whites, when it used to be blacks mainly at his concerts. MJ knew this. He didn&#39;t want any blacks at his concert. Blacks complained so much that the prices were lowered. There was a press conference about it on t.v. I remember just like it was yesterday. Black people were crying.Ask your parents they&#39;ll tell you I&#39;m right. I knew something about him was a mist at this time, but I mainly realized he was changing when I saw the billy jean video. &amp; the white woman was on the billboard. I couldn&#39;t understand that it seemed strange, but just like everyone else I loved. Things were different then, its a whole different world now. All that stuff you are talking about is the way it is NOW. It wasn&#39;t like that back in the day. Black male singers crooned to black women. bey &amp; MJ.=apples &amp; oranges Bey is in a different time. This is 2013. not 1976 or 1980. Today everything is jacked up. I&#39;m just trying to say to you that it was enjoyable when we blacks could enjoy MJ at an arena before white girls got so obsessed with him . White girls weren&#39;t doing that stuff with any other black singer only MJ so it was tough for us, cause they mattered, it was all about them. It was a though MJ was a new artist or something. Like he didn&#39;t exist until they starting liking him. Black girls yelled &amp; screamed for MJ before white girls started liking him. But when they became interested. The news only associated white girls with MJ as opposed to us. As though we never even knew about him. March 23, 2013 at 4:48 PM Anonymoussaid... The main point I was trying to make with my comment was, white people of course they liked MJ. But white girls started OBSESSING over him around late1981. They usually just sat back an listened to him before, rather than showing other whites just how much they were attracted to a black man. The white race was still a lttle unaccepting of white women desiring black men. March 23, 2013 at 5:12 PM Anonymoussaid... You having a personal problem with MJ having white fans is just that......your problem. Get over it. MJ would not have had anything to do with the ticket prices. Blame that on promoters, etc. If you can blame MJ then you can very well blame the brothers as well. How would you know black crooners are just singing to black women. Joe is an amazing singer and very underrated. He does not just sing to black women because not only black women are his fans. MJ has/had the appeal to become the crossover success he became and it was going to happen regardless. You are sadly miguided if you honestly believe MJ shut out his black fans. That is just the way you feel. Strange how a lot of us still remain his fans even to this day. SMH. MJ, as we all know, had a problem with self esteem. To him, nothing that he did was good enough whether it was his performances, recordings, etc. He did have an issue with his appearance. He saw himself as unattractive despite the fact that he was drop dead gorgeous. However, I have seen stills from his videos and the blotchy skin is evident. You can believe what you want. Your hatred and disdain for him is what is misguided as well. You have it in your warped mind that he was this self hating, anti black individual when he was not. However, if you are convinced of that then so be it. Doesn&#39;t make it the truth. White girls obsessing over him in 81 as you say were no different from the ones who were in 79...only a two year difference. White women &quot;invading a black man&#39;s turf&quot;. What do you think of Foxy (famous for the song Get Off) and Hall and Oates who are know for being blue eyed soul? Don&#39;t you think sistahs were checking them out and jamming to the songs? Back then, a lot of things were better. You have a problem with white women and black men, but what about the Williams sisters? They seem to only date &quot;other&quot; men. Are they sell outs? Do they have a problem with their race and color? Are they shutting out their black fans? Society at the time may not have been as OPEN with interracial marriage and dating back then. But, trust, it was going on. I don&#39;t have a problem with it who is a fan of who as long as they are enjoying their product and respect the artist. March 23, 2013 at 8:37 PM Anonymoussaid... 8:37 I failed to tell you that the press conference on tv was all the jackson brothers including Michael, they were acting heartbroken because black people were so sad. They announced the ticket prices were going down. bottom line is MJ didn&#39;t continue to embrace black people. I don&#39;t have a response to your last post because you didn&#39;t understand one word I said. March 23, 2013 at 11:31 PM Anonymoussaid... Ask your parents about that press conference. March 23, 2013 at 11:34 PM Anonymoussaid... I said white women were invading the black WOMANS&#39; TURF not &quot;invading a black mans turf&quot; turf means territory March 23, 2013 at 11:47 PM Anonymoussaid... I know what turf means (seriously) and the press conference was on television and I think Don King was amongst them. As stated, MJ alone will not have anything to do with the ticket prices. You are just wanting to single him out for something. You can have a flat tire and blame MJ &quot;not embracing black people&quot; as the cause. Of course you would not hava response for the last comment. You don&#39;t have a logical explanation for anything you say in regards to MJ. The Jacksons/MJ are entertainers. They were never meant to be just the &quot;black woman&#39;s turf&quot;. As singers/entertainers they were to entertain the masses and being famous exposes one to other races who become fans. They were never to be exclusively for the black community. They are entertainers. They have nation and worldwide exposure and gaining &quot;other&quot; fans was bound to happen. MJ not embracing his people is ludicrous. I have told you the reason behind &quot;Bubbles&quot; name, I have told you what MJ did for Little Richard, etc. But, that of course is ignored. I asked you about the Williams sisters. You say white women invades the &quot;black woman&#39;s turf&quot;. What about the other way around? How do you feel about black women feeling Robin Thicke, Jon B? I don&#39;t see you calling out the Williams sisters for dating &quot;other&quot; men. Wouldn&#39;t someone like you feel they should stay with their own race? March 24, 2013 at 10:42 AM Anonymoussaid... 10:42 Don King??? I for the life of me do not remember Don King being there. Don King is a boxing promoter. Why would he be there? It was just all 6 of the Jackson bothers, they were acting pitiful &amp; remorseful because of all the black fans being so upset. Look everything I am saying to you is what I experienced back them &amp; i just remember it so well. I remember the press conference &amp; Jermaine saying &quot; I think the ticket prices are worth it, acting like he was afraid to express his opinion. &amp; all the other brothers acting heartbroken &amp; embarrassed that the black people were so upset. the ticket prices went down. My MOM purchased tickets &amp; we went to that concert. We couldn&#39;t afford the original prices.
