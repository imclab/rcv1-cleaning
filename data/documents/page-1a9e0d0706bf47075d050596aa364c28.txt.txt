Peggy’s first two years as King of Otuam unfold in a way that is stranger than fiction. In the end, a deeply traditional African town is uplifted by the ambitions of its decidedly modern female king, and Peggy is herself transformed, from an ordinary secretary to the heart and hope of her community. Frederick County Public Libraries and Frederick Reads will host the free public appearance by King Peggy at the Weinberg Center on Sept. 13. No tickets are required for this free event. Books will be available for purchase. For more information, visit fcpl.org or call the Weinberg box office at 301-600-2828. One Maryland One Book is Maryland’s only statewide community reading project and is the signature program of the Maryland Center for the Book, a program of the Maryland Humanities Council. Initiated in fall 2008, this year-long project culminates with two months of public programs, using literature to spur conversations in communities around the state on issues critical to Marylanders. One Maryland One Book is designed to bring diverse groups of Marylanders together in library, school or community settings to share a common reading experience by discussing a work of literature and participate in other related programs. “We are delighted to be a part of the One Maryland One Book program,” said Frederick Reads Chairperson Elizabeth Cromwell. “Our community is very excited about reading the book and participating in the programs.” More about One Maryland One Book IMAGE : 'King Peggy' author to come to Frederick More about Frederick Reads IMAGE : 'King Peggy' author to come to Frederick ARTICLE : Will Allen's food revolution continues in Frederick ARTICLE : Frederick reads Will Allen IMAGE : Frederick reads Will Allen [if IE 6]> <link media="screen" href="http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fredericknewspost.com/content/tncms/live/components/core_social_share/resources/styles/social_share_ie6.css?_dc=1375265128" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> <![endif]  Discuss Print  Posted in Books , Frederick , Features , Books , Frederick news post  on  Sunday, August 25, 2013 2:00 am.  | Tags: One Maryland One Book , Frederick Reads  Rules of Conduct 1 Keep it Clean.
