 "reads like a thriller" 
 
 Overall Performance Story 
 
 
 Terrific story behind a massive series of art swindles in the 1990's by a couple of somewhat talented gentlemen.  The authors provide such great detail, you can feel as if you are looking over the shoulder of the swindler.  Solid narration makes the audio book even more enjoyable.

 Close up look at the evolution of the recorded business over the past 30 or so years.  Lots of great detail on personalities, as well as interesting events.  I've been listening to Audible for 14 years, and the narration performed by Dennis Boutsikaris was, by far, the best reading I've ever heard.  The content was 5 star.  The narration was 7 star.

					In this star-studded autobiography, Clive Davis shares a personal, candid look into his remarkable life and the last 50 years of popular music as only a true insider can.

 Kinberg's story is interesting due to his quick succession from film school into the industry. Also worth listening for is his unique writing method-- outlining single scenes for hours before even opening up Final Draft...

 As a guitarist, choral director and musician of over 30 years, I have a pretty good understanding of the physics of music as well as music theory.  However, I came away learning a number of new things from this book AND with a more solid understanding of things I already knew.   While I agree that a British reader may have made the listen a little more fun, the narrator was fine for me.  The author's recordings at the end of chapters were good in most cases, but his demonstration of vibrato and rubato were generally not that obvious, even to someone who knew exactly what he was doing and trying to communicate.   His explanation of the overtone series and how they contribute to an instrument's sound was VERY good, as was his explanation of how the pentatonic scales were mathematically derived (something that I didn't know).     The author also did a good job near the end of the book explaining the weird "names" for classical compositions.  His appendix explaining the intervals and songs that used them was also very good.   Only other criticism (and it is a small one) is that the use of terms tone and semi-tone is less common than whole step and half step, which may confuse some readers a bit.   All in all a really nice read and the author has a GREAT sense of humor!

					Forty years ago, Harriet Vanger disappeared from a family gathering. Her body was never found, yet her uncle is convinced it was murder - and that the killer is a member of his own family. He employs journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the tattooed, truculent computer hacker Lisbeth Salander to investigate. When the pair link Harriet's disappearance to a number of grotesque murders from forty years ago, they begin to unravel a dark and appalling family history.

					This no-holds-barred autobiography chronicles the remarkable life of Phil Robertson, the original  Duck Commander  and  Duck Dynasty  star, from early childhood through the founding of a family business. Life was always getting in the way of Phil Robertson’s passion for duck hunting. An NFL-bound quarterback, Phil made his mark on Louisiana Tech University in the 1960s by playing football and completing his college career with a master’s degree in English. But Phil’s eyes were not always on the books or the ball; they were usually looking to the sky....

					It’s all about the food…. For the Robertsons, family is typified by the dinner table, where both food and fables are dished up with equal care. Anyone with a good story - whether it be a hunting escapade or one of the children’s antics - is welcome to share. And that’s what this family is all about - sharing, caring for one another, and the love of good food. Chapters are built around recipes that represent each stage of the Robertson life. What do faith, family, ducks, and money have in common? Korie and Willie Robertson!

He tackled rants in his first book, and now he tells his best stories and debuts some never-before-heard tales as well. Adam Carolla started broke and blue collar and has now been on the Hollywood scene for over 15 years. Yet he never lost his underdog demeanor.

					The zombie plague unleashes its horrors on the suburbs of Atlanta without warning, pitting the living against the dead. Caught in the mass exodus, Lilly Caul struggles to survive in a series of ragtag encampments and improvised shelters. But the Walkers are multiplying. Dogged by their feral hunger for flesh and crippled by fear, Lilly relies on the protection of good Samaritans by seeking refuge in a walled-in town once known as Woodbury, Georgia. But Lilly begins to suspect that all is not as it seems....

					Without sparing the embarrassing details, Balbirer chronicles the two decades she spent as a struggling actress in the trenches of show business. From the searing purist tutelage of David Mamet at NYU Drama School ("In show business, women who are lucky enough to find employment are asked to do only two things in every role they ever play: take your shirt off and cry") to her bizarre 1 AM  Saturday Night Live  audition for Lorne Michaels, Balbirer recounts her sometimes disappointing, sometimes painful, and always bizarre adventures.

					He thought it would be fun. And a way to prove to himself that his vibrant youth was still in there somewhere. So this 61-year-old folk singer and acoustic guitarist signed on with a hip-hop band of 20 year olds, hit the road with them on a cross-country tour and quickly discovered how terribly naive he was.

					Hayao Miyazaki is one of the world's most respected Japanese animation filmmakers. He is known for creating compelling characters, engaging stories, and breathtaking animation, all of which have earned him international acclaim while setting box-office records. Miyazaki, who began his career in 1963 as an in-betweener for Toei Doga studio, soon found his true calling as an anime and manga artist, working on classic Japanese features and television series and writing the best-selling manga,  Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind .

					The high-water mark of punk was at the height of a summer of royal love. Millions attended street parties to celebrate the Queen's 25th anniversary on the throne. Meanwhile, a more irreverent party had been planned. A boat laden with The Sex Pistols, their Svengali manager Malcolm McLaren, journalists, and various friends and hangers-on sailed by The Houses of Parliament while The Pistols blasted out Anarchy In The UK. Shortly after, the boat was boarded by police and "persuaded" to return to shore.

					Amy Winehouse is a tragic and extreme example of the price of fame in the UK in the Noughties. She was someone who'd been pursuing fame since childhood. She'd attended theatre schools, learned guitar, and sung with the National Jazz Youth Orchestra. Amy took much or her style from the '60s girl groups (the beehive) and from Ronnie Spector (the Cleopatra eye-liner). Amy's style was somehow already familiar but very fresh to a young audience. With frightening regularity she was on the tabloid's front-pages: Amy with a new tattoo...stumbling from a club...looking skeletal.

					This was Britain's first gentle whiff of drug culture in pop music. The sounds of what later became known as the Summer of Love, were first encapsulated on this side of the Atlantic by Procol Harum's hit. The concepts of free love, liberal politics, casual drug use, communal living, and opposition to the Vietnam War were at its core. Slowly the culture had infiltrated first the American West Coast music scene and then more popular culture. In London, everything was just groovy. Hair was worn a little longer, beads were sported, and flowers waved about. "A Whiter Shade of Pale" was the debut single from Procol Harum, which went to number one in the UK.

					Afro-Caribbean calypsos had taken root in the folk scene of the early '60s, but for many Britons their first experience of this new music came courtesy of an effervescent, feisty young woman from the Jamaican slums called Millie. "My Boy Lollipop" became the first hit single for Island records. Millie even appeared on a Beatles TV special in 1964. This was the start of a cross cultural pollination.

					He was born a Canadian on a Friday the 13th in 1929 - the year of the Crash. His boyhood was one of privilege: an ancestor was a Governor General; his great-grandfather Sir John Abbott was Canada’s third prime minister and owned railroads. There were steam yachts, mansions, and a life of Victorian gentility and somewhat cluttered splendor. Plummer tells how "this young bilingual wastrel, incurably romantic, spoiled rotten, tore himself away from the ski slopes to break into the big bad world of theatre, not from the streets up but from an Edwardian living room down".

					In 1960, she was a 17-year-old Brooklyn kid with plenty of talent but no connections and certainly no money; her mother brought her soup to make sure she stayed fed as she took acting classes and scraped out a living. Just four years later, Barbra Streisand was the top-selling female recording artist in America and the star of one of Broadway’s biggest hits. Now the acclaimed Hollywood biographer William Mann chronicles that dizzying ascent, telling the riveting behind-the-scenes story of how Streisand and her team transformed her from an unknown dreamer into a worldwide superstar.
