Kaiser 27 Aug 2013 | 7:53 am Here are some new photos of Lady Gaga arriving in London. Literally, this is what she wore on the plane and these are pics of Gaga arriving at Heathrow. She pretty much flew to London the day after the VMAs – she has some shows in London and she’ll be doing some press for her new album. Am I supposed to be shocked by her outfit? It’s not shocking. At all. And I think it’s funny that she keeps wearing that one great wig – looks like she doesn’t really want to be “grotesque” after all. She wants to be pretty and wear her pretty, flattering wig and have everyone admire her body. Nicole Richie presents her guide to dining al fresco: lovely or strange? Bedhead 27 Aug 2013 | 7:52 am Nicole Richie appears in the September issue of Domaine magazine to show off her backyard and love for dining outdoors, and the results are stunning. As you may have gathered from previous stories, I kind of adore Nicole and will defend her until the sun goes down (at which point, I&#8217;ll drink some boxed wine and change the subject) because I&#8217;m strangely proud of her for doing something with her life beyond being Paris Hilton&#8217;s sidekick.

I blurred the booty not only to save everyone from NSFW imagery but also because I find it hilariously ironic to censor Miley&#8217;s rear after we all saw it hanging out of vinyl on Sunday evening. Miley, for better or worse, was the undisputed &#8220;winner&#8221; of the VMAs even though she didn&#8217;t actually win awards for any of her four Moon Man nominations.

Kanye West and Taylor Swift in 2009. It’s mostly because there’s an “aftermath” and every celebrity has an opinion about what went down and who is to blame and after about 48 hours, everyone starts getting really hyperbolic and judgy. As I said yesterday (and as it was happening on Sunday), I thought Miley looked and acted like the biggest cracked-out stripper that ever was. Some say she was obviously on drugs, some say she was just high on attention. It was all just embarrassing and gross and people are still&hellip;  People.com Latest News Katherine Jackson: Paris Is Now 'In a Good Place' with Treatment 27 Aug 2013 | 8:45 pm "She is doing much better," says her grandmother.

The brand didn&#8217;t just do denim this time around, they also included numerous other clothing pieces in their new Spring/Summer collection. They had shorts, dresses, skirts, sweaters and jackets. Since we are a denim blog though, the denim featured was true to the Mardou &amp; Dean heritage. Each piece had the diagonal button fly that is present in every Mardou &amp; Dean jean.

You can buy Current/Elliott online from Shopbop.com. Vanessa Hudgens in Levi’s Cut-Off Denim Shorts Jonathan 27 Aug 2013 | 5:00 am Vanessa Hudgens was spotted doing some shopping in Studio City, California. The actress wore a pair of Levi&#8217;s cut-offs with some ankle boots and a dotted halter. I think the shirt and the shorts are greats pieces separately, but together with this whole look, there is lot going on. I think the shirt would look great with a more fitted pair of shorts that was more high-waisted. You can click here to purchase the Levi&#8217;s shorts from Urban Outfitters.

Sorry. It was a huge success. I am so proud of this movie directed by Lee Daniels (&#8220;Precious&#8220;, &#8220;Paper Boy&#8220;) and starring Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey. It is an moving (but also humorous), important slice of American history. One you&#8217;ll want to bring your whole family to see.
