Mass backing is also available as an upgrade for your new molded pickup carpet and is used for additional sound deadening and heat shielding. Mass backing is ethylene vinyl acetate 40 ml thick that is bonded onto the back of the carpet at the time that it is manufactured. Our customer's love this upgrade and we highly recommend the mass backing option for your new carpet. The mass backing upgrade is available at an additional cost, but does not take any longer to ship. You will still receive the heavy jute padding for the floor pan areas. Use this link to learn more about the mass backing upgrade option and to see a picture of mass backing. Please note that mass backing can only be applied to a piece that is made in a mold. Any die cut pieces cannot have mass backing applied since it is applied during the heat process of molding. Please be aware that the cargo area for the 2005-2008 Mustang coupe complete cannot have mass backing applied to the cargo area carpet since it is a die cut piece.
