My Ghost Story - New Episodes Mondays @ 9/8c Tonight on Bio 8:00 PM TV14 Mobsters: Joey Gallo He rose from the slums of Brooklyn to take on the biggest Mafia dons of the 1950s and 1960s. Joey Gallo began his criminal career as a small-time loan shark and jukebox racketeer. He became a top enforcer in the Profaci crime family, but felt he never got the respect he deserved. So Gallo formed his own gang and revolted against mafia Don Joe Profaci in a long, bloody war on the streets of New York. But there was another side to Joey Gallo--the ruthless mob leader was also an artist and an avid reader. Living in Greenwich Village with his wife Jeffie, Gallo was inspired by his beatnik neighbors and their counterculture ideas. He also began hobnobbing with New York's social elite, befriending everyone from Neil Simon to Jerry Orbach. In the end though, nothing could save Joey Gallo from a dramatic end. 9:00 PM TV14 Gangsters: America's Most Evil: Alejandro Corredor This episode focuses on the gangster of suburbia who led a double life, Alejandro Corredor. He seemed like an average family man living in the small town of Fairway, Kansas. But in his other life, he was Kansas City's cocaine pipeline, moving massive shipments from Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. With the money from drugs, he invested in a local gangsta rap group called Block Life. Eventually, several members of Block Life helped him sell drugs to some of the most notorious gangs in Kansas City. As the money from drugs and the success of Block Life grew, Alejandro strove to keep a balance between his two worlds. But his dealings with the Sinaloa Cartel led him down a dangerous path that would threaten to destroy everything. 10:00 PM TV14 Gangsters: America's Most Evil: Sex, Money, Murder, Inc. - "Pistol Pete" Rollack New Tied as a boy to Mr. Untouchable, heroin kingpin Nicky Barnes, Pistol Pete came up in the game, growing up in the Soundview projects of the Bronx. In the mist of the 1980s crack epidemic, Pistol Pete earned his nickname after starting his own gang--Sex, Money, Murder. He and his underlings incorporated the organization in an effort to launder the drug money and expanded their operations outside New York. Pistol Pete would ultimately confess to pulling the trigger on many of his rivals, but justice wouldn't stop his killer reputation. Once behind bars he continued to orchestrate murders. At the age of 25, in order to avoid the death penalty, he accepted a plea bargain of life behind bars in solitary confinement.
