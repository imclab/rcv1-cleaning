These guys are the most honest and helpful mechanics I've ever met. They are always thorough and up-front about diagnosing my car, and they always let me know what it needs and what options I have before they actually start working on it. I can always trust them to let me know what my car needs without pressuring me. James is always so helpful in explaining what is wrong with my car and I always feel comfortable asking questions and getting suggestions as to what work I should do on my car. They always give me good advice and I always walk away feeling like they actually care about me as a customer and not just getting my money (like so many other mechanics out there). After 5 years of taking my cars to Excalibur, I highly recommend them to anyone in search of good, honest mechanics. 0 Heart JMcc's Review ID: 480423032 Recommends JMcc Joined 2 years ago 5.0 July 21, 2011 My Knights in Shining Armor. Brad and James are my knights in shining armor. Referred to me by my boss, not only did they not disappoint, but they went above and beyond any expectation I could have ever had. As a woman who knows pretty much nothing about cars and no readily available male resource to turn to, I have to rely on what I'm told not knowing whether it's true or who to trust. First Texas Honda wanted me to pay $500 to replace rotors that Excalibur found only needed to be resurfaced at nearly half that price. Then, they referred me to their contact at Discount Tire for a full set of tires at a great price!! And I'm certain that the call from James helped me get such a great deal. It used to be hard to tell who to trust in the car business, but for me, not anymore. I won't take my car to anyone but the guys at Excalibur Automotive. Don't waste your time at the dealer thinking you're getting top notch service. They'll only read a manual and charge you double the cost of what it may require. The guys at Excalibur will tell you the truth and only suggest what is necessary at the time. You can trust them. They want your business and they're willing to earn it with knowledge, skill, good service, and fair pricing. You will NOT be disappointed!! 0 Heart ponchv's Review ID: 480347291 Recommends ponchv Joined 2 years ago 5.0 May 28, 2011 Auto Repair at it&#039;s best. The guys at Excalibur are the only repair shop you can take your vehicle and rest at ease that they will take care of your car. They offer excellent service and accurate assessment of your problems and costs. I have teen drivers and college students in my house and I can always count on them just calling Brad, James, or Anandas and they are taken care of properly. In fact, while I was deployed overseas I spoke with Excalibur and they told me not to worry, they would take care of my family and if it was serious we could settle up when I return. When people say they &quot;support our troops,&quot; Excalibur shows you they mean it! 0 Heart mrsc68's Review ID: 480326616 Recommends mrsc68 Joined 2 years ago 5.0 May 13, 2011 &#034;Excalibur&#034; Great Repair Shop. Brad and the guys at Excalibur Automotive is the only place I take my cars and truck to have repairs done. They have always been very friendly and knowledgable. I recently had my AC fixed and it was done within 2 days. Blows extremely Cold. Then I took my sons car in and had his AC fixed. We were in and out the same day as his appt. and his blows extremely Cold also. These guys are quick and good mechanics. I recommend them to anyone for their auto repairs. 0 Heart unknownx's Review ID: 480323514 Recommends unknownx Joined 2 years ago 5.0 May 11, 2011 outstanding experience. the guys are extremely friendly, honest, and professional. reasonably priced and do excellent work. will continue to take my truck to them. 0 Heart asapdel's Review ID: 480323373 Recommends asapdel Joined 2 years ago 5.0 May 11, 2011 Long time customer. I've taking my vehicles to Excalibur for 20 years and have never had them be anything but honest and professional. My daughter goes to college out of state but I make sure that when she comes home to visit that she has ALL of her repairs and maintenance done by Excalibur. They never do anything more than needed but make you aware of anything that may be needed soon. Thanks for the GREAT service - keep it up! 0 Heart Ins Lady's Review ID: 480322463 Recommends Ins Lady Joined 2 years ago 5.0 May 10, 2011 Exceptional Service. I recently purchased an older car for my teenage daughter and then after a month stupidly backed into it. I was told it was a total because the cost of repairs was more than the value of the vehicle. I took it to Brad to determine if it was worth repairing. I should have taken it to him before I bought it. He said we were lucky, the car was not safe. It had many problems and was not a car I should have purchased. I trust Brad, James and his crew implicitly. They never take advantage of you, they are honest, fair and you always know they will give you a good deal. They state the facts and let you decide. They take the time to explain everything to you. I am not one who understands cars but after talking with James and Brad I always know they have done right by me. There have been many times where if I had not had my husband to question a shops work I might have been taken for but NEVER has this happened with Excalibur. THEY ARE THE BEST!! 0 Heart Terri 78746's Review ID: 480322364 Recommends Terri 78746 Joined 2 years ago 5.0 May 10, 2011 I love Excalibur!. We've been taking our cars to Excalibur for over 20 years and have always had wonderful service. My most notable visit was just after I had taken my car to the dealer to fix something that was under warranty. After I got the car back, the a/c did not work properly. I took it back to the dealer, and since the warranty had just expired, they said it would cost $1100 to fix because the dashboard had to be removed to get to the part. I took it to Excalibur, for a second opinion, they plugged a hose back in &amp; told me it was ready. No charge. It worked perfectly. These are great guys and I love that they will drive the car around to get it to make the weird noise that you need fixed! 0 Heart ashvan02's Review ID: 480318399 Recommends ashvan02 Joined 2 years ago 5.0 May 08, 2011 Thank you soooo much Excalibur!!. So, we were in town from out of state and our a/c decided to go out in the middle of Austin, TX!! My husband and I were told to go to a well known repair shop that, I would rather not mention, who told us that they would have to replace the WHOLE a/c unit AND that it would be $1100 AND that it would take a couple of days to get the parts from the dealer!! Seriously?? We were on vacation and we didn't have a couple of days and traveling with a 6 month old with no a/c was out of the question!! We went to lunch to think about what we were going to do when someone overheard us and recommended Excalibur Auto Repair, and said it wasn't too far up the highway. As soon as we stepped in we were greeted with the very friendly office staff and they took our SUV in immediately! It was a very clean office and I felt safe taking my baby inside to wait while the other shop was a little scary. Come to find out all our SUV needed was a little freon and it was only $78!! Thank you Excalibur for saving our trip and saving us even more money!! We were in and out in one afternoon and the a/c is better than before!! Great Job guys!! 0 Heart Fern621's Review ID: 480317292 Doesn't Recommend Fern621 Joined 2 years ago 1.0 May 06, 2011 AVOID EXCALIBUR!!. It's rare that I give an auto repair shop two shots at fixing my car when it does less than stellar work the first time. However, after I penned a less-than-positive review on another site, the owner, Brad, emailed me asking for a second chance to correct situation. When I first took my '94 Mercedes-Benz to Excalibur, I asked them to repair the heater/ac and oil lamp light sensor. Neither of those things were fixed but they managed to charge me $500! As you can imagine, I was not happy! Brad accused a newly hired mechanic for the incompetent service and that MY review prompted his firing. This time, he promised me that HE would personally do a thorough inspection of my car. It had been a few months and by now, my car was dying on me when I would drive it for more than 30 minutes. So I gave Excalibur another chance to redeem itself. Well what did Brad and the guys tell me this time: I SHOULD GET RID OF MY CAR!!!! Saying the repairs would cost more than the car was worth!! When I pressed the mechanic foreman, Anandas, about what specifically was wrong with my car and how much it would cost to restore, he COULD NOT tell me! Instead he showed me cell phone photos he took of the underside of my car; pointing out the rust and saying the gas and brake lines would eventually have to be replaced. (Had he and Brad actually taken a CLOSER LOOK, they would have found that the gas and brake lines had ALREADY been REPLACED.) Of course, this &quot;diagnosis&quot; and &quot;advice&quot; was on the house! Angry that these so-called mechanics wasted my time and money (cab fare), YET AGAIN, I took my car to another, reputable shop. They not only pinpointed the problem (a faulty air mass meter) but fixed it in less than a day. Plus the mechanic gave me a computer generated list of what needed to be repaired and said it would cost $2,500 (parts and labor) to totally restore my car. Brad called me a week later to ask if they resolved my problem to my &quot;satisfaction&quot;! Seriously?! I told him NO and asked for a refund. He tried to persuade me that I got &quot;value&quot; for the job they did, even though he admitted that the job his guy(s) did was &quot;INCOMPLETE&quot;! He refused to give a refund and stood behind his shop's lousy &quot;work&quot;. Based on my experience, I don't know how Excalibur managed to get its five star rep. Do yourself a favor: AVOID these con artists! 0 Heart See more reviews for Excalibur Automotive Repair Write a Review for Excalibur Automotive Repai&#8230;  Sign in to Write a Review Write a Review... optional  People also viewed Buddha's Garage Japanese Auto Tech Deluxe Auto SVC Mueller Automotive Brake Specialists Plus  Your Friends Sign in with Facebook Sign in with Facebook to see what your friends are up to!
