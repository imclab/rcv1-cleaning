Leasing a vehicle means that a person pays the amount by which a vehicle&#39;s value depreciates during the time they are driving it. Depreciation is the difference between a vehicle&#39;s original value and its value at lease-end (residual value), and is the primary factor that determines the cost of leasing. Why Leasing has become so popular Leasing has become popular because it offers people a way to drive the vehicles they want â&euro;&rdquo; often better vehicles than they could buy â&euro;&rdquo; for less money compared to purchase. Like BMW Lease. Leasing has become increasingly popular over the years because of two main factors. First, the cost of new cars has spiraled upwards recently, often escalating prices out of reach of average buyers. Second, tax law changes in the late 1980&#39;s eliminated interest deductions on automobile loans, further increasing the cost of ownership. The net effect is that people have become increasingly eager to find ways to make their personal vehicles more affordable. Leasing is simply a method of paying for the use of a car, truck, SUV, or van over a specified period of time Once the consumer and dealer agree on a price, and the lease contract has been signed, the dealer then sells the car to the leasing company at the agreed upon price. The leasing company then leases the car to the consumer, based on that price. For this reason, price becomes the most important factor in what a person pays in monthly payments. The car dealer acts as an agent for the leasing company. This way, the consumer is relieved of having to interact directly with the leasing company until they start to make monthly payments. The dealer works out the terms of the leasing agreement on behalf of the leasing company. For this service, the leasing company usually pays the dealer a commission, which adds to the dealer's profit on the deal. Once the contract is signed, the consumer's relationship is with the leasing company, not the dealer, unless it is an issue with the vehicle itself. Leasing companies used by dealers are usually subsidiaries of the car manufacturer, such as Mercedes Benz Financial Services for most of the Mercedes leases, Ford Motor Credit used for most of the Ford leases, and General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) for most of the GM cars, BMW Financial for most of the BMW leases, Lexus Financial Services for most of the Lexus leases, Toyota Financial Services for most of the Toyota leases, all these companies have excellent and friendly lease transfer policies. However keep in mind that dealers can also offer auto leases from banks and other lending institutions with which they have developed mutually beneficial business terms. Therefore, automobile dealers are in the business of providing automobiles; leasing companies, banks, and credit unions provide auto leases. The consumer has the option to shop for his/her own leasing company, bank, or credit union The consumer has the option to shop for his/her own leasing company, bank, or credit union to find better lease terms compared to the leasing companies offered by the dealer. These independents can often arrange to secure an even better price due to fleet purchasing arrangements. The tradeoff is that dealers make it very convenient to arrange for both: the vehicle and the lease all in a single meeting , and the dealer's specified leasing company can often offer special lease terms to help the dealer move vehicles. Signing a leasing contract means that the consumer agrees to make regular monthly payments, keep appropriate insurance, pay any vehicle taxes and licensing fees, and take good care of the vehicle. Furthermore, the consumer agrees to keep the car for a specified number of months â&euro;&rdquo; standard leases are for 18, 24, 36, or 48 months â&euro;&rdquo; and is expected to hold onto the vehicle through the end of the lease contract. At the end of the lease the consumer is expected to return the vehicle to the leasing company with no more than normal wear and tear. And so the consumer will have to pay for any damage or extra miles over and above the contract-specified limits. Car lease transfer experts help lease owners through each step of the auto lease transfer process. Consumers may have an option to purchase the vehicle at lease-end for a specified price, if they choose. Or they may be able to use the car as a trade-in on a new car. Otherwise, the consumer can simply return the vehicle to the leasing company and walk away. Consumers need to be mindful, however, of the amount of equity value in the vehicle that they would not want to simply give back to the leasing company.
