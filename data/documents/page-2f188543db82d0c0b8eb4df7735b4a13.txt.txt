Posted by Erin Coughlin , January 18, 2011 at 11:19 AM Comment Recommend  Flag as Inappropriate Loading...  x &times; Next Previous Slideshow Download It&#39;s all too common in the music scene where musicians playing at bars often struggle to be heard due to an amateurish sound system or clueless sound technician. It&#39;s not a problem you&#39;ll find at Grounds &amp; Sounds, the monthly live music coffeehouse event held at the , which over the past four years has proven itself as an appealing venue to both aspiring and well-known performers from all over the northeast as far as Maine. “We use live music and musicians at our services,” said Michael Kauffman, a member of the congregation. “We like to take our love of music and bring it to the community.” On Jan. 14, vocalist and keyboardist Dan Pelletier made another appearance at Grounds &amp; Sounds to perform several of his folk- and blues-inspired songs. A former computer programmer turned lawyer, Pelletier&#39;s songwriting is inspired by a wide range of subject matter – everything from the circus to controversial issues, and the recurring theme of true love. He cited influences like folk singers of the 1960s and &#39;70s, old cowboy songs and artists like James Taylor, Bruce Springsteen Roger Miller, and Jim Reeves. Using humorous anecdotes, Pelletier explained the backstory behind each and every one of his songs. Some of the titles performed included “Death To Part,” “You and Me Cat,” “For Better Or Worse,” and “Amazing Will End Us.”  Halfway through his first set, Pelletier brought his own brother Tom on stage to perform “Mom and Dad Dancing,&#34; a song inspired by their own parents’ fairy tale, that seemed to genuinely touch the diverse audience on a profound and personal level. “The people are here to listen. They pay attention,” Dan Pelletier said. The event also featured a half-hour open mic session, where audience members were encouraged to sing two numbers of their choosing on stage. Vocalist Erin Furey and guitarist Rick Cashman performed “Isle Of Hope,” a song written by Cashman that was inspired by the earthquake in Haiti last year. The high ceilings and wide-open space provided ideal acoustics for both vocalists and musicians. The venue can comfortably fit up to one hundred guests, and provides a wide variety of drinks and snacks for purchase. Coming up in February, UUFSB is planning its fourth annual Valentine’s Day show. The Claudia Jacobs Band will be making another appearance in March and in April, there will be a Best of the Open Mic Night Showcase.
