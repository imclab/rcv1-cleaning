Dawn Richard of the once popular group, Danity Kane , recently posted promo shots for the ladies and their pending reunion. Noticeably absent from the shot is D. Woods who said that she was told nothing of a reunion to begin with (although it was initially rumored that she said &#8216;no&#8217; to the idea ). Since they&#8217;re no longer working with Diddy , I&#8217;m very curious and anxious to see what Danity Kane has in store for us. I actually liked them as a group (along with several other artists that have died in the Diddy &#8216;sorry you thought you made it, bitch&#8217; cemetery) and only wish the best for them&#8230;. IF they bring the heat . Even if the music flops, we&#8217;ll at least have these dope photos to look at! What do you guys think? According to their official website , they&#8217;ll be making an announcement at this year&#8217;s VMAs, which is slated to air today on MTV!

Since we all know that Kris is about ratings, she used this opportunity to debut her new grand daughter, North West , to the world. Those cheeks&#8230;. But back to Kanye for a second. I&#8217;m not one of those people that says that when one speaks properly, they&#8217;re acting white because that&#8217;s bullshit. However, where did this new Sweet Valley High voice come from? It&#8217;s not even about him speaking properly&#8230;he just doesn&#8217;t sound like himself.

The alter ego of Kirk Franklin recently dropped his video for his song, F-ckin&#8217; or What , a hood anthem that asks direct questions that need immediate answers. I have to admit that I&#8217;m a little disappointed with the video. Although I smiled a little when I saw him eating crabs while performing, I think that the video itself should&#8217;ve been more in line with the song&#8217;s topic. But I guess when you&#8217;re likely working with a budget of zero and you want to really push the &#8216;get to the point&#8217; message, this is the way to go. Meanwhile, I&#8217;d say that the twerk team did it better. You might also like: Video: Mario ft.

If you&#8217;re a frequent viewer of VH1&#8242;s latest reality show, The Family Hustle , it would appear that T.I. &#038; Tiny have one of the most fun, perfect marriages in Hollywood. However, Tiny recently posted a photo on Instagram that would make one wonder is everything as happy as it seems? I absolutely love them as a couple! Maybe she was having a moment after a disagreement and took to social media to air her grievances. Or maybe she posted it because at one point, she could relate and it means absolutely nothing now!

The threesome recently stopped by Power 105&#8242;s The Breakfast Club where they talked about legitimizing themselves as a group, jokes that have made them a &#8216;thing&#8217; on Twitter, and how they had issues with Fantasia during a recent tour. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people attending their concerts and have heard nothing but great things about their performances (in spite of the MESS of a performance courtesy of Ginuwine HERE ). It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how they continue to grow, if at all. Although I&#8217;d hope that egos don&#8217;t eventually trip them up, you never can tell. Are you a fan of TGT?

Once I witnessed him and his struggle braids motorboating the life out of some chick&#8217;s backend, I didn&#8217;t even care to know about his other accomplishments before that point. More recently, Benzino became the &#8216;victim&#8217; of a nude pic leak via Baller Alert . Two things come to mind at first glance: #1. The top portion of his wang looks like lips might&#8217;ve been there first and #2. The box TV in the bathroom&#8230;.I can&#8217;t deal. No neck. No wang. No money for mounting a flat screen. Click HERE to see the pic! Updated to add: apparently Benzino&#8217;s way of retaliating against those who form weapons against him is by sending additional nudes .
