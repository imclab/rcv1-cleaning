The local Better Business  Bureau will give you information on whether complaints have  been filed against a specific Suzuki service shop , the total number and whether  or not they have been resolved. Suzuki Mechanic Qualifications: Ask the service manager if the  shop's mechanics have been certified by Suzuki or a professional  organization, such as Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), and  in which areas they have been certified, such as brakes, electrical,  etc. Look for Suzuki mechanics with good training  and credentials, updated knowledge and skill, proper tools and  equipment and experience working on your particular model automobile. Warranty: If your Suzuki is covered by warranty, be certain that  the facility you select is authorized to perform Suzuki repairs under the warranty. Work done by an unauthorized Suzuki repair  shop may void you warranty and be costly to you. Appearance of Service Area: The work area should be clean, well  lit, organized and stocked with modern equipment and professional  quality tools. Customer Service: Ask if the Suzuki repair shop provides the customer services you desire, such as transportation  to and from work while repair work is being done, a loaner car,  evening and weekend hours or a discount for work done on Sunday. Suzuki Car Repair Pricing: The cost for the same repair may vary greatly  from one shop to another. If you know what type of work is needed,  ask several Suzuki service shops for a written estimate. What should you review when repairs are complete? &#8226; Carefully review the completed invoice before you pay  the bill to be certain that all requested work was done, and ask  for an explanation of any changes or discrepancies. &#8226; Request a written warranty or guarantee, if applicable,  and know what it covers. &#8226; Ask for all replaced parts and save them until you are  sure that the Suzuki car repairs are satisfactory. &#8226; Inspect and/or test drive the car in the parking lot  or on the highway, if that is where prior symptoms arose, to make sure the problem has been corrected. &#8226; If possible, pay for Suzuki car repairs with a credit card since, under certain conditions, you can withhold  payment if the repairs were not done correctly. &#8226; Bring any Suzuki repair service problem to the shop's attention  as soon as possible, and give them a chance to correct any deficiencies.
