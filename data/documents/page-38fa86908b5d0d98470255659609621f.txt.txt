You fill the room with over inflated egos, throw in half a dozen cameras and make them all fight for the attention and admiration of the viewers at home, like some kind of musical Hunger Games. This year&#8217;s show was no different &#8211; some tried good old fashioned showmanship, some wore ridiculous costumes, and one person in particular tried to vibrate her ass against Robin Thicke before getting frisky with a giant foam finger. No prizes for guessing who that was.

The 7 Most Bizarre Celebrity Endorsements By Rhiannon Davies - August 26, 2013 People are idiots. You&#8217;d be amazed at the amount of money that some companies can reel in just by convincing the people at home that their favourite celebrity simply can&#8217;t live without Albert Bartlett Rooster potatoes. The stars might get a big fat wad of cash in return, but when you&#8217;re raking in the green as it is, do you really need to be filmed telling the whole world about your preferred brand of a panty liner? It would be weird if one of your closest friends tried to sell you on the merits of various sanitary towels, let alone if some glamorous stranger tried to convince you. Some endorsements are living, breathing proof that if you throw enough money at a famous person, they&#8217;ll say whatever you want them to.

Ben Affleck Gives Kiss Of Death To The Superman Franchise By Rhiannon Davies - August 23, 2013 One more nail has been added to the coffin of the Superman sequel&#8217;s credibility, and it looks remarkably similar to Ben Affleck. In what&#8217;s being called &#8220;&#8230;the worst thing to happen to the franchise since George Clooney&#8217;s bat nipples&#8221;, Ben Affleck has been confirmed to take on the role of the hero Gotham deserves for Man Of Steel II. Bet you didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be reading the phrase &#8216;bat nipples&#8217; this early in the day.

Wentworth Miller Comes Out And Totally Burns Russia At The Same Time By Rhiannon Davies - August 23, 2013 It might be fair to say that Wentworth Miller, like a lot of people, isn&#8217;t too pleased with the Russian government at the moment. Judging by his recent confession, the Russian government probably isn&#8217;t crazy about him either. The St. Petersburg International Film Festival invited the Prison Break star over to pop on over to Russia and watch some movies with them, and he responded with the classiest damn rejection letter to ever also be used as a means of officially coming out the closet. That&#8217;s a tough category.

Sponsored Video: What Girls ACTUALLY Do Before A Night Out By Rhiannon Davies - August 21, 2013 Girls, I don&#8217;t want to alarm you but our cover has been blown. Someone has spilled the beans on how we actually get ready for a night out. ABORT MISSION. The perpetrators are none other than Smirnoff Ice, whose new video &#8220;Straight Primpin&#8221; has exposed the closely-guarded secret of exactly why girls always take so long to get ready for a night out. We&#8217;re busy making novelty rap videos to put on the internet and rolling around in cheese.

Demi Lovato Turns 21, Celebrates With Homemade Porn By Rhiannon Davies - August 20, 2013 Demi Lovato turned the big 2-1 this week, and what tends to go hand-in-hand with the ability to drink? Embarrassing photos of your hoo-hah, that&#8217;s what! Around twenty dirty pics were apparently offered to Radar Online by an unnamed source &#8211; read &#8216;Wilmer Valderrama&#8217; &#8211; who have opted not to publish them any of them despite the fact that as a gossip website, they are pretty much bound to humiliate celebrities in any way that they can.

Perez Hilton Is Still A Psychotic Bully, In Case Anyone Was Wondering By Rhiannon Davies - August 19, 2013 Is it just me, or is there a bad smell round here? Oh, right, that could just be the stench of Lady Gaga and Perez Hilton airing their dirty laundry in public.  Let&#8217;s go back a few years &#8211; Perez Hilton is using his blog to force people out of the closet, post crotch-shots of underage girls and making up such inspired and original nicknames as &#8216;Jennifer MANiston&#8217;. This is then followed by an epiphany that he sullies the good name of  &#8217;cynical and bitter celebrity gossip blogger&#8217; and a promise to never be mean to anyone again. As it turns out, like a small child that&#8217;s been forced to apologize for biting a classmate, he just meant that he&#8217;d be more sneaky with it next time.

Robert Pattinson Channels His Inner Kanye And Acts Like a Spoilt Brat By Mandi Barrie - August 19, 2013 When Robert Pattinson was leaving music venue Troubadour in West Hollywood last Friday, he shoved a man in the face assuming he was a photographer&#8230; when he was in actual fact a security guard. Awkwaaard. The poor bloke whose head was flung back and had his glasses knocked of his face was all oh em gee &#8220;He grabbed me on my face&#8221; but also reasoned &#8220;He thought I was someone else&#8221;. This is why you leave the angry hulk like behavior to seasoned pro’s like Kanye West. He would simply fix his steely eyes on your way and have you pissing your pants at just “Don’t talk to me…don’t even talk to yourself” before having your ass on the floor. If you’re going to throw down you really ought to commit to the part.

Lea Michele Pays Tribute To Cory Monteith At Teen Choice Awards By Mandi Barrie - August 12, 2013 Glee’s Lea Michele won Choice TV Comedy Actress at Sunday nights 2013 Teen Choice Awards and dedicated the award to late boyfriend and co-star Cory Monteith in a teary and heart breaking tribute.

Lady Gaga Casually Parades Her Vagina In Stupid Artsy Fartsy Video By Heckler Spray - August 11, 2013 It&#8217;s just another Thursday for Lady Gaga who appeared butt naked in a Kickstarter video promoting the Marina Abramovic Method aaaand that’s enough WTF news for the day year. The 2.19 minute video is roughly 2.19 minutes too long and sees Lady Gaga blindfolded and naked in the middle of the woods with her body contorted in various positions. She also lies in the nude on the floor clutching a huge crystal against her body. Other disturbing images which you won’t be able to un-see include her wearing some sort of yellow spiked glasses standing in a river dressed in a jumpsuit. Tamer aspects of the video show her covered in crystals. Oh and all of this takes place against a background chant of ‘EHHHHHH’… as you do.
