Store! Contact NEW!: EPICSTANCE Car Culture Meet at TIMETOATTACK – DEC 16 2012 By Tom &ndash; December 5, 2012 Posted in: Auto Events , Auto Features , EPICSTANCE Email Share StumbleUpon The stance culture has taken the world by storm and it&#8217;s not difficult to understand why. It&#8217;s in the ability for style discerning car owners to not just personalize their rides, but to go wild with colours, wheels, tyres, ride height, mix and matching parts. Basically there&#8217;s is just no right or wrong! If you&#8217;re already in the scene, or even just partly, we want you! This December 16 (Sunday) we&#8217;re adding a new segment to the TIMETOATTACK where we celebrate style, boldness, individuality, extremities and anything that has to do with the stance culture. No matter if you&#8217;re a privateer or a car club in the scene, it&#8217;s a first ever meet you should not miss! For this inaugural EPICSTANCE meet, we&#8217;d like to start it off as a non-competition event to start the ball rolling. So what does it take to participate? Just you, your stancified car and an RM50 entry fee to be a part of the first Stance Culture meet at Sepang Circuit. You also get EPICSTANCE stickers among other freebies. There will also be an exclusive parade lap on Sepang Circuit for the cars attending the EPICSTANCE meet. Plus, as a TIMETOATTACK tradition since 2010, we&#8217;d be producing a video of the EPICSTANCE segment and It&#8217;s gonna be hella exciting!, so spread the word and we&#8217;ll see you at EPICSTANCE on Dec 16 2012!
