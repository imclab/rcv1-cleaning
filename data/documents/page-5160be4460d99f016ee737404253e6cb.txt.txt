Cheating (in any form) is a big deal but they had a really long relationship, thought it was stronger than that. I agree with those who said "took her long enough" because she didn't deserve all the c**p she received from his fans either! How do you breakup with someone in the army? 0 Back to top  #12 Honeyseung Honeyseung ♕All Hail Queen Honey♕ Member 1,914 posts Location Earth  Posted Yesterday, 07:59 AM I'm pretty confused. If she broke up with him in march, why did she make herself seem like an idiot standing by him in that scandal. Well I hope she finds happiness.
