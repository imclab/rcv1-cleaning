  Home Our Services Tire Services Web Specials Testimonials FAQ  Georgetown Auto Repair We are Georgetown&#8217;s original family owned and operated auto repair facility! We live in Georgetown. We went to school in Georgetown. We spend our money in Georgetown. We are currently training the second generation owners of Lansdale Automotive, our very own sons! We opened our business in 1990 and haven&#8217;t looked back. We are the oldest and most established auto repair facility in Georgetown. We fix cars other shops can&#8217;t. Experience matters when getting your car worked on. We operate our business every day with the motto &#8220;We care about your repair.&#8221;  We encourage you to take the Estimate Challenge. Go to any corporate chain store and get an estimate, then come here and we will go over your vehicle and check out your estimate ourselves. It&#8217;s very common for us to save our customers more money from corporate chain store&#8217;s estimates than we make on the auto repairs that we end up doing! We had one customer recently who had to go to one of the chain shops on a Saturday and they told her she needed parts replaced that she had recently just replaced! Total bill $2,500! Now that&#8217;s a &#8220;Whopper&#8221; especially when you KNOW its not true! The fact is, that kind of thing happens more often than you can imagine. So&#8230; get an estimate at a chain store, then bring it to us. We&#8217;ll show you what it really needs! We use the latest technology to repair your vehicle. Come on by and meet the family, we look forward to seeing you and servicing your car!
