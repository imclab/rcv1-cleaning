What can happen to injectors and can ASNU cleaning help? The pintle and seats are ground to very fine tolerances, at specific shapes. This gives the injectors the ability to produce a spray pattern in the form of a cone. Problems can occur when the chemicals, lacquers and varnish in the fuels contaminate the injector. It has been shown that a varnish layer as fine as 5 microns within the pintle head can restrict fuel flow through the injector by as much as 25%. Deposits on the pintle will alter the injectors Spray pattern and Fuel flow rate. Dirt in the fuel can cause a build up of debris inside the filter basket and reduce the Fuel flow. These deposits can change the shape of the pattern, from a fine atomized spray to one of the wrong shape, or that has thin liquid streams that will not burn properly. Both of these conditions will cause drivability problems. ASNU identifies the problems with electronic injectors, it allows the operator to physically see the improvements that ASNU'S ULTRASONIC CLEANING has made. Why pay for new injectors when we can make them AS GOOD AS NEW  Complete Auto Repair is proud to offer our chassis dyno service to meet your performance and drivability needs.
