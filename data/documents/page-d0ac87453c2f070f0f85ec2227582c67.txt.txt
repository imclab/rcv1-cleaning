Be smart about which ads to pursue. The big advantage to buying a used car from a private party, rather than a dealer, is you'll most likely save money on your purchase. The disadvantage is you could lose $1,000 or more in a car-buying scam. While most used-car sales conducted by individuals are perfectly legitimate, there are used car-buying scams out there, and they are on the rise -- even for so-called local sales. This is because so much of the business has an online component. In fact, consumer complaints for car sales scams increased 25% last year, according to the Internet Crime Complaint Center , a U.S. government agency. Here are five tips to avoid a used car-buying scam if you are shopping for a used car locally and considering a private-party sale: How to haggle when buying a car 1. Prices that seem too good to be true Research a car on one of the many vehicle-pricing sites, such as Edmunds.com , Kelley Blue Book or NADAGuides.com , to determine the private-party price for that car. If you are seeing an ad for substantially less than the typical private-party value, it's probably a scam, no matter what sob story you are told. 2. Sales in which the seller and the car are not in the same place A common story is that of a member of the military stationed elsewhere or someone who recently relocated who needs to sell his or her car. While this can be legitimate, most people who relocate make decisions about selling their vehicles beforehand. After all, there is plenty of hassle involved. A car is expensive, so you want to be able to inspect the used car in person and meet the seller before any money changes hands, or you want purchase through a reputable third party, such as eBay Motors, that has a buyer-protection plan in place. 3. Sellers who offer you third-party protection plans One way scammers bilk unsuspecting buyers is by offering them a protection plan through a well-known third party. Many of the companies cited don't even offer buyer-protection plans, and those that do offer them only for cars sold through their websites. Companies that offer them do so only for cars sold through their websites. Some scammers are so savvy they've set up online chat functions to reassure the buyers the protection plan is secure, but this is simply an elaborate ruse. If a seller offers you a protection plan and the used car is not being sold through the company mentioned, then it is a used car-buying scam. 4. Sellers who switch gears in the middle of negotiations If you face a changing story, a sudden shift in the terms of the sale or a request to move the transaction from one website to another, beware. These are common scammer tactics, but they're rare among legitimate sellers. 5. Sellers who ask for money upfront or want to use a wire-transfer service Buying a used car locally is just like buying any other product. The money should change hands when the buyer can leave with the product. The only instance in which a buyer should make any payments in advance of purchase is when the transaction started and ended via a well-known third-party service that uses an escrow system for transactions. Sellers who request money in advance or those who want to use a wire-transfer service are likely running a scam. Car buyers who believe they've witnessed a scam, whether or not they've fallen victim, should report it to their local authorities. If the scam involved anything Internet-based, the Internet Crime Complaint Center should also be contacted. More from Bankrate.com: What goes into gas prices?

Their problem is that i was, and still am pretty car savvy. The one who told me he drove the Mustang home and to work every day could not explain why the grooves in all the pulleys were so rusted. It was because the belts polish them while the engine is running. And the one who told me this car had never had a scratch, and I pointed the marks left by a jitterbug sander by a fast-and-dirty body shop when they repaired a bunch of body damage. I don't want to talk to a salesman until I have looked at what I am interested in. Usually they try to steer me to some dog they can't get rid of, and I tell them to call the junk yard. Bottom line: have somebody you can really trust, and who knows cars look at it before you buy, and get any garranties in writing before you sign.      40      6 Replies ( 1 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... self made May 22, 2012 5:30PM If you supect a scam! 1) post it a.s.a.p on the General &amp; the Local News Community section of Craig's list-by posting locally others can read what is happening in your area. I know our local paper needs&#160; a SECTION devoted to local scams. 2) always use COMMON SENSE and get a Car Fax before the purchase and look @ the wear on the brake pedal it is an indicator to the true mileage on the car and even how the car was cared for. 3) If you are not qualified to check the car over, please get someone who is to give run Diagonistic test or report&#160;so you will know what you are getting. This costs in most cases is well worth it. &#160; &#160;      21      2 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... oldiesdeejay May 22, 2012 12:48PM New and used cars sales person, insurance sales people, computer repair geeks for big box stores etc all trying to separate you from your had earned money. Before you buy anything do your research ahead of time. I used to work for a company&#160;that &#160;would tell you what to "push" on a customer. I told my DM if a customer was looking for that item they would probably ask about it and I wasn't going to sell them something they didn't want. (He justed needed to increase his bonus). Needless to say I did not last very long .      23      11 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply...

I had always been very car savvy but I also had driven mostly v8's and when I test drove a car &#160;that only had a 4 banger. I thought the car sounded ok but it did not have any power at all. I purchased the vehicle for 750 bucks. I changed oil and drove it for only 100 mile and the engine froze up it cost me another fifteen hundred to repair the two bad cylinders and&#160; replace the cam. During this time I also had to contact the previous owner she as it turned out was just a friend of the owner, but she had given me the title and luckily she got the previous owner to go to the DMV and say she sold car to me. Buyer beware!!! &#160;The car was rebuilt twice and still was a piece of crap 1980 mustang 4 banger. I will never again own a 4 cylinder. I drive a 2003 Mustang with a V6.      7      9 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply...
