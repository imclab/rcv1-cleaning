We are in PA. My bro's buying a 2009 Suzuki XL7 SUV and he's trading in a 2007 Jeep Liberty Sport SUV for it. Driver's License Ins cards Registration Besides all the crappy paperwork that came with the Jeep what else does he need? Thanks-K&amp;K and lbp in Brookhaven PA.

Unless you are new to the country and the lender needs proof that you are legal.

I want to sell my vehicle and I have done some online research on what I would need to do step by step. I learned that I need to have both parties fill out a Bill of Sales as well as form DTF-802 - statement of transaction before I transfer the title. I have a few questions: I know I have to take the plates off of the car, but what do I do about the window sticker that has the registration expiration date on it? With the tax form, do both parties pay tax on the transaction or just one (seller? buyer?) When I turn over the title, I know i should sign it and date it and record the odometer reading on the back, is that all I do there? Thank you very much for your help, as you can tell, i have not done anything like that before and I thought it would be smart to ask. Thanks again Replies to this message: keimanzero (Aug 10, 2009 4:37 pm) Reply #17 of 21  Re: selling a vehicle [justdoeh]  by keimanzero Aug 10, 2009 (4:37 pm) Replying to: justdoeh (Aug 10, 2009 11:27 am) Hi New Yorker dude, I'm from PA but down here you leave the danged thing on the car windscreen. That inspection is proof the car's OK to drive, sell, trade in, give away, whatever. Dunno about the laws of NY though. Anyone?

Reply #19 of 21  Crummy Scenario...Need Help  by irishdriver Aug 15, 2009 (2:58 pm) I purchased a new vehicle recently, and "traded in" my leased Honda. According to Honda, I am perfectly able to use it as trade in etc. I was upfront with the dealer about the vehicle as a lease, showed him the exact payoff amount via Honda, and had Honda fax the payoff sheet to the dealer (salesman was there while I was on the phone). They typed up all the paperwork, etc. and we all signed and I drove away in my new vehicle, satisfied with the transaction. I got a call several days later from the dealership. Apparently they had done the paperwork incorrectly and had given me the tax minus trade which apparently you cannot do with a leased vehicle. They want me to return to the dealership, "tear up the paperwork" and give them over a thousand dollars more. I certainly understand this was a mistake, however I am frustrated. I was open about the lease. They are the professionals. They walked me through the paperwork, we shook hands, I wrote a check and left happy. I do want this resolved...amicably. I ran it by another finance manager as well as my attorney, and based on my brief description they said that I am not liable for the difference. The dealership is telling me that "everything is void, and we need to tear up the paperwork." They said that I dont own the vehicle that I drove away with, and I need to return to settle the difference. When I explained that I understood but didnt think I was necessarily responsible for the error, they gave me the "whether its my fault or yours doesnt matter, you OWE us. Look at it whatever way you want". Now I want this resolved, and certainly am fine to having it resolved fairly. I have no hard feelings towards the people involved and I understand the error, however they laid everything out for me and it was at a price that I was comfortable with. Ill be honest and say that I dont appreciate how forcefully they have been in making it seem like my fault, and also my responsibility. Who is to say I would have made the purchase at over $1k more? Ive put miles on the vehicle, made changes, etc already. I really enjoy it! Who is to say this wasnt a trick by them to get me to buy at my max comfortable price, only to get the rest out of me later? Where do I stand on this? Am I correct to believe that one option is that they are still obligated to pay off the lease and I keep my purchased vehicle? Do I offer some form of alternate solution? Any help, clarification, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Also, there is usually a provision in the sales contract that states that the tax and license fees are estimates only and that the buyer is reponsible for any adjustments. If that language is in your contract or buyers order you are 100% responsible even if the dealer made a mistake. Honestly, you should just pay what you owe.

Perhaps. Or, if the selling dealership insists that the contract is void, offer them to return their vehicle and restore you to where you were originally (and perhaps see how fast they backpedal... or not.)
