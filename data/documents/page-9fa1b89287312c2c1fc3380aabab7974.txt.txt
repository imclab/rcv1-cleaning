 Royals pound Tampa Bay 11-1 
 Tampa Bay would have preferred more snow. Instead, with temperatures soaring into the mid-90s, the Royals roughed up the visiting Rays 11-1 on Monday in the makeup game for the May 2 &#x201C;snowout.&#x201D; 
 
 
 
 CHIEFS NOTEBOOK 
 Chiefs tight end Moeaki suffers another injury setback 
 Tony Moeaki, a four-year veteran tight end, had a history of injuries in college at Iowa, and it has followed him with the Chiefs. He missed all of the 2011 season because of a knee injury sustained in the final preseason game, and he missed all of the offseason program this year after undergoing a procedure on his knee. Now he&#x92;s out indefinitely because of a shoulder fracture.

 Facing regret after death of sister 
  DEAR ABBY: I am a 65-year-old active woman who still works. I play tennis several times a week and have a loving relationship with my kids. I know with certainty that I have many good things in my life. However, since my sister died last year, I have been having second thoughts about a lot of the decisions I have made over the years, especially regarding relationships and my choice of jobs.

 How will &#x91;SNL&#x92; replace Sudeikis and the rest? It&#x92;s all up to Lorne Michaels 
 Although new &#x93;Saturday Night Live&#x94; cast members come from many different avenues, there&#x92;s ultimately only one way to get on this NBC late-night franchise: impress Lorne Michaels, the &#x93;SNL&#x94; creator and executive producer who has run the show for 33 of its 38 seasons and is known for his cryptic, sphinxlike presence over the show.

 In the spirit of spirits, KC's small-theater scene has something for every taste 
 Small theater companies in Kansas City are the equivalent of microbreweries. Inspired by national and European traditions, they create a product drawn from regional resources for a loyal local audience, and they contribute significantly to the creative energy of the performing arts in Kansas City. These are the craft beers of local theater. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Theater Review 
 Humor, compassion are chief attributes of &#x91;The Session&#x92; 
 Melting Pot KC&#x92;s production of &#x93;The Session,&#x94; a new play by Harvey Williams, suffers in execution but brims with humanity and humor. Williams writes with such compassion for his characters that he&#x92;s likely to win most viewers over, even if they conclude that the show isn&#x92;t quite ready for prime time.
