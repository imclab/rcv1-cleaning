If two neighbors get into an accident, they are more likely to pay for the repairs privately, rather than call the police and insurance companies. So if the accident has never been reported, how will paying for a &quot;Car Report&quot; help? It won't, it's the key flaw in the system. Having a proper inspection of the vehicle can tell you if the vehicle you're interested in has been in a previous accident, and if it has, the quality of the repair work, both mechanically and structurally. Each year 400,000 totaled vehicles are back on the road again -Consumer Reports 1 in 15 cars on the road today have been rebuilt from the salvage yard -ABC News 20/20 Can you be sure they changed the oil?

Not always, and not if it's done right. Specially designed gauges in the hands of qualified inspectors can tell if the paint is thicker or thinner than it should be, indicating if a car has been repainted, and the quality of that paint job. This could hide many things on a vehicle that the average consumer would not be aware of because the car &quot;looks good&quot; you can be led to believe that this is a quality vehicle, or that quality repairs have been done, when in fact it may not be. This can happen whether a car is purchased from a dealer or an individual. Each year there is over $35 Billion in vehicle accident damage; and over 40% of the repairs are substandard. - Farmers Insurance Our Services Expert Witness Testimony Used Car Inspections Salvage Inspections Classic Car Inspections Exotic Car Inspections Boat Inspections Marine Inspections Motorcycle Inspections Heavy Equipment Inspections Auction inspections Pre-purchase inspections Warranty inspections Damage Appraisals We Also Serve Brokers Warranty Companies Financial Institutions Leasing Companies Business Hours 6 Days a Week! 8 a.m. - 8 p.m. EST Closed Sundays Why Choose Us?
