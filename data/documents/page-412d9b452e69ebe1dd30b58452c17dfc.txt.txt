Top 1000 Contributor AMAZING FOR THE MONEY!! ,  12/03/2011 By NewPreemieParents , Snellville, GA 5 out of 5 We ordered this online @ 4:30am on black friday and had it shipped site to store. Picked it up today and got it home in our little Corolla easily with the seats down and some rope to secure the open trunk with it hanging out a bit. It's MUCH bigger than we thought. The headlights &amp; tail lights are plastic and look like real lights---they are NOT stickers. However, they are NOT functional headlights--but they never are in these toys. Assemby of the windshield proved challenging--had to use a flat head screw driver to hep force the notches in and that was scary, but no breakage. Did have a screwpeg that came broken off upon arrival...it attaches the seat down, but we're going to try to find a long replacement screw to correct this since they are sold out &amp; it's a Christmas gift. The back wheels, the 2 gears (one for L &amp; R), and the car body underneath all have sticker labels which are &quot;supposed to be&quot; denoting the Left &amp; Right sides of the car for you...this is opposite of what TRUE LEFT &amp; RIGHT ARE! BUT, DO FOLLOW the stickers even though they go against common sense...you will see the wires colors match up when you do it right as their stickers indicate. The gear shifter &quot;clicks&quot; into place for F1, F2, &amp; R, which is good. It mimicks a real floorboard gearshifter--TOO CUTE! Battery seems fine, despite other reviews stating otherwise. It's all plastic (like ALL powered toy cars) except the wheel rods are steel. Heavy &amp; seems sturdy. Double seat belts, not one big conjoined belt. Tires don't have a very deep tread, but they have a line of hard rubber down each center for traction, thus it's description for &quot;smooth surfaces&quot;. I can see how grass would not do well, but driveways and pavement will. Definitely TOO BIG for indoor use. One person can not easily move it around alone. SHINY white body and SHINY &quot;chrome&quot; were terrific surprise! We got the 3 year ext warranty to avoid future problems. Hoping all stays well for our 3.5 year old for a long time. Looks like a SUPER EXPENSIVE battery powered car! IMPRESSED!!!! DAZZLED! Click an image to enlarge it. (Click anywhere inside this popup to close it) Overhead view after assembly.

The instructions were very clear and easy. The wheel gear boxes were mislabeled, which made the car go backwards. Just make sure the color wires on the gear box match the side of the wires inside the car. I had to swap the sides of the gear boxes. And don't put on center wheel caps until you have the wheels properly placed. And there are 2 seats for 2 children with 2 individual seat belts. Overall this car is excellent for the money!!

We had to HUNT down this car and drive to a little town outside our major city to find and upon reading the owners manual, (the speed or lack there of) I became very nervous and upset that we may have purchased a dud! Me being the nervous Nanna that I am came home with Pop and assembled, charged and loaded it with a 50 pound bag of sand and with the hand on the petal we test drove it, around our trees with large roots and the yard (slightly rough) and it went great. With that said this is a SUPER DEAL! However in doing my research on this product, of which I found no reviews, I discovered many were for sale on Craig's list and such. At $99 or $119 this car is a steal, great buy however you want to word it via Wal-Mart but these people on the web wanting $200 and up are crazy... wait ....even if you have to pay $119 it's worth it and Wal-Mart is now showing that you can purchase it online again.

My daughter only rode on it one time and it just died. It wouldn't charge or anything after that. I had a very upset kiddo after that. Looked up other reviews online and this problem happens ALL THE TIME with these!! The batteries are just worthless! Had to return to walmart 2 days after we got it... And it looks like 2 children can fit in it but they can not! My daughter just barely turned 3 at the time and you definitely couldn't fit another child beside her. I bought her a Barbie jeep instead and even paying more was WAAAY worth the money!!! It still runs like brand new and they are built much better! Trust me, these cars a cute but a BIG JOKE!!!!

My kids just loved and adored this car...for a WEEK. That is as long as it lasted, I bought the warranty with it as well. I called the warranty place, they told me it wasn't their problem since it was still under he manufacturers warranty. I called the manufacturer and they told me that they would call me back within 72 hours because their call volume was so high. They never returned my call. After the 72 hours I called them back and they told me they had no spare batteries and that I could try to purchase a new one through the store I purchased the car from. Unfortunately, walmart does not carry the type of battery it uses. After many calls, and being on hold for hours Walmart finally made it right by replacing it with a Powerwheels Barbie Jeep. We have had the Jeep almost a year and it still runs strong. The associate also mentioned that many people returned the car. The manufacturer also mentioned this car being a &quot;special desgn&quot; for Walmart's black friday event #makes me wonder if they are intentionally using cheap parts?#. I definately would spend the extra money on a better Battery Powered Ride On Vehicle. Product Attributes: Value 1 out of 5 Meets Expectations 1 out of 5 Recommends this product?

This car is a piece of junk. The battery does not last past 1 charge and the company will not stand by their product. IF you MUST have this car...buy the $15 walmart protection plan because you WILL use it without a doubt. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! READ OTHER REVIEWS. Kids get very upset when their car breaks down!! To make matters worse you cannot get a replacement batter for this thing. Bad purchase all the way around. PowerWheels are the much better way to go.

The price was the only reason my kids would have ever gotten something similar to a power wheels. I don't have the money to spend on the real thing. Guess this is a lesson of if it's too good to be true it probably is. Both worked great Christmas day but after charging them through the night the atv lasted maybe 2 minutes an the car didn't even last 10 seconds. Tried it a second night just to be sure and the same thing happened. Btw.. we followed the charging instructions EXACTLY. Very hard to explain broken Santa toys to a 3 and 4 year old. Really didn't have the money to purchase the real thing but did anyway. What was supposed to be a $200 purchase ended up costing me an additional $250. I do not have the patience to deal with the manufacture on this. Both have been returned to Walmart. Hope they don't ever carry anything from Winston again!!!!

The car was fully charged and worked great Christmas Day then the saddnes set in. With very lttle use only on weekends and when it was warm enough to go outside they used them. Approximately 1 -2 months later both cars will not charge. My granddaugthers would just go sit in them and play with their baby dolls as though they worked. Unfortunately I did not purchase the extended warranty only because I thought is was a good product like Power Wheels which my neighbor has had the red mustang gor 6 years and it still works.

The box is kind of big but not to heavy. I fit it in my CRV easily without incident. I to did not plan to open it until Christmas but after reading several reviews and possible issues I may encounter I did. There is not much to putting it together and like several other reviews if you follow the colored wire scheme you shouldn't have a problem with the wheels. Other then that you put the windshield, mirrors, steering wheel and seat together and you're done. The seat gave me a little problem because the screws didn't line up correctly but after a few tries I got it. The rest was easy! No problem with the battery and it appears to run good. We will see how it goes over time. My only negatives is that the doors do not open and there are no lights but for the price and the way it looks and attention to detail (ex. gear shift, front and rear lights, exhaust etc.) I'm extremely pleased. Good luck to those who are about to buy this car. Product Attributes: Value 5 out of 5 Meets Expectations 5 out of 5 Recommends this product?

Charged over night so it would be ready for Christmas. It worked fine on Christmas day so I thought we found a great buy. Put it back on the charger when it started showing signs of slowing down. Charged again for about 10 hours but it was as if it didn't charge at all. Tried again over night and still had the same result. I put a battery tester on the battery and it showed 12 volts. Tested all connections and everything seemed to be working right. I have a Battery Tender Jr. that I decided to try. I clamped it on the battery and it showed that it was charging. Kept the Battery Tender on overnight and when I went to check on it the next morning, it showed that it was fully charged. Plugged it back up to the car and viola, we have a working car and happen child! There must be something wrong with the charging system. It will be a pain to have to unscrew and take off the hood every time it needs to be charged but hey it was $99. I don't have a problem doing that to save a couple hundred dollars. I hope this helps some of you others that are having battery issues. Product Attributes: Value 4 out of 5 Meets Expectations 2 out of 5 Recommends this product?

I took it out the box on dec 23rd so it can charge. When i took it out the box it had some juice so i followed the instructions on charging it. On xmas day there was no life I checked the connections under the hood and under the seat. My daughter was super upset. Later that night i decided to take a better look at conections. I flipped the car over and under the pedal there are 6 plugs. One was loose!! When i put it back the car was perfect. PLS ppl check under there. The connections slide on and off so they can easily come undone after some time. Now it runs perfect! This may be a resolution worth a try!

The style and appeal of the car is wonderful. From what I could tell, my husband and brother had no issues assembling the car. The tires were placed on incorrectly at first causing to the car to go backwards when it was in the forward gear but that was mistake on our part and was easily corrected. We immediately put the car together to use and had no problems while my child used the car. Overall, I would say is it an excellect product for the price!

I had the same problem. The wire colors are right, but the sticker that said L or R was on the wrong motor that caused me to put it on the wrong side. 0 points Read Comments (1) Read Comment ( 1 ) Review 17 for Convertible Car 12-Volt Battery-Powered Ride-on, White 5 stars minus the bad battery ,  12/27/2011 By code2 3 out of 5 I would have given this car 5 stars, but only having to work for the first hour it receives 3 stars. Now it doesn't have to be returned just b/c of a bad battery, but it should be exchanged without additional money. The setup is quick and easy. The car speed is really quick and even jerks my 5 yr old head when pressing on the pedal in high gear. There is no clear way on how to power on the unit or when the battery is fully charged. Here is what I found out. Flip the ON/ OFF switch to the OFF position. Charge the battery using the wall supply for 12 hours, take charger off the car and put the switch to the ON position/ Now the car is ready to go. There should have been an LED to indicate when the battery is fully charged on the car or power supply. Overall if you get a good battery, the car has no defects, and you receive all parts, I would say for $99 this is an excellent deal!

My husband put it together and it had scuff marks on it and scratches on the bottom when he opened it. The manual does not say how long to charge it the first time or if it needs to be in the on or off position when charging. We charged it for 16 hours on Christmas Eve and then my son used on and off all day Christmas day. We charged it over night and then the next day he used it for 2 minutes and it would not even make it up the drive way. The day before it was working great up and down the drive way and in the grass. So we charged it the rest of the day and over night. Today it will not even make it down the driveway. I am not happy with this car at all. I called the number provided on the manual and they said they would call me back and never did. I called again and the number is busy. I think I will be taking it back to Walmart and buying a Power Wheels car. About the picture added... the car comes all white. We added removable decals because my son wanted a spider-man car.

Very happy to be one of the lucky ones to get this car! I have read all the reviews on this car after the fact but, despite what I have read we had no trouble getting the car together. We did notice the right and left backings were wrong but, used common sense and switched them out, put the car in gear and it took off without an issue. For everyone that went through all the madness like myself to get this car only to package it up and send it back, word of advice- break out the tools and the husbands. The issue with this product is a simple fix and the 12v battery can be replaced if it does not work. Smiling faces on Christmas morning!

We were so excited to &quot;win&quot; it on black friday after standing in line for over 2 hrs and after reading the great reviews. All we did was buy it-put it in the car and place it in a remote area in the garage. We didn't open it or put it together because we didn't want to damage it or to get it dirty. SO ..comes christmas eve, the kids opened their smaller gifts and Christmas in hopes of having that big gift. The kids went to bed at 10 and we pull the car out to put it together. Take out all of the parts and get to the body of the car and LO and BEHOLD the SUPPORT FRAME IS CRACKED!!! No damage to the box or styrofoam so it must have been packaged that way!! We are SO upset! There was nothing we could do--it's christmas eve -no stores were open--manufacturer was closed to complain ti and NO BIG GIFT for our youngest!! Heartbroken-so we blame the manufacturer for sending out a broken and defective toy for a what was supposed to be the most exciting gift. Thank you Winston company for ruining our christmas.
