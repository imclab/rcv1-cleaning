Your car&#8217;s manual or handbook will have specific recommendations for maintenance, but here are eight things never to overlook. 1. Tire repair and Wheel Alignment Besides checking that the tires&#8217; pressure is correct – low pressure will cost you gas mileage – regular inspection and rotation is needed to even out wear and detect suspension problems. If tires are wearing unevenly, wheel alignment or a suspension service might be needed. 2. Brakes and rotors Effective braking depends on brake pads that grip discs or rotors. The friction material on the pad wears down with use and the pads need to be replaced before the material is all gone. The rotors also wear and have a recommended minimum thickness. Typically, they will need replacing every second or third pad change. 3. Oil change and lube Oil’s main job is to lubricate moving parts and carry away minute particles of dirt and debris. An oil change shop will check the level and top up or change the oil as necessary. While you’re at it, don’t forget to ask about auto transmission servicing too! 4. Check that bulbs are working It&#8217;s easy enough to check that the lights are working, but replacing the bulbs can be harder. A good car electrical service place or mechanic will gladly repair the headlight or fix other electrical problems. 5. Brake fluid Expert advice on brake fluid  is that it be replaced every three years. The reason is that most brake fluids absorb water. This is bad for three reasons. First, it lowers the boiling point of the fluid. Second, that water can cause corrosion which, in turn, damages seals, leading to fluid leaks. Third, lower viscosity can affect how the traction-control and antilock systems perform. And don&#8217;t forget to check the brake fluid level regularly. If it is low, it should be topped with the appropriate type of fluid. A good auto brake service center or local mechanic will know what your vehicle needs. 6. Radiator Repair If the coolant level keeps dropping, a radiator service station can check it for leaks. 7. Engine service An engine produces a lot of heat, and if it gets too hot, it can suffer serious damage. Both the cooling system and engine oil carry heat away. Fluid levels should be checked at regular intervals. 8. Washing That&#8217;s right, regular washing is an essential part of car maintenance. Unless road grime is quickly removed, it will eat into the paint, causing irreversible damage. It&#8217;s even more important to clean the underside, especially during winter, when salt can build up in crevices and quickly lead to corrosion. Your car&#8217;s manual will suggest what maintenance should be carried out on what schedule. Use DexKnows auto repair listings to find specialists in your neighborhood.
