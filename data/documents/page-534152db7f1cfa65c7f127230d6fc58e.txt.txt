His disposition was humble, yet his self taught talents were immense. Sure, he started with pin striping and flame painting, but what about those cars! Who can argue the design and execution of the Mantaray? If it&#8217;s not the most exciting custom car ever built, we don&#8217;t know what is. In fact, back in the 1960s, plans to produce the Mantaray as a 1/25 model kit were drawn up by the original Kats at AMT. Later, the plans landed in the hands of MPC, but a slot car instead of a static kit was the single item to be produced. Other 1:1 custom cars designed and built by Dean that became incredibly successful model kits include the Monkeemobile and Coyote dune buggy, both released by MPC in 1:25 scale. The infamous Green Hornet Black Beauty was released as a 1:32 scale kit by Aurora and later by Polar Lights. We feel privileged to have known Dean and are very sad about his passing. We hope that wherever he is, he&#8217;s striping and building bitchin&#8217; customs.  This entry was postedon Friday, May 10th, 2013 at 6:53 pmand is filed under Slot Cars .You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.You can skip to the end and leave a response.
