         Monday, April 22, 2013 Usher Fan Disrupts The Voice A crazed Usher fan had to be escorted out of a taping of The Voice for disrupting the show to get Usher's attention... From Page Six An overzealous female fan of R&amp;B singer Usher was tossed out of a taping of NBC&#8217;s &#8220;The Voice&#8221; Thursday afternoon after she repeatedly yelled out to the superstar from the audience to get his attention. The unidentified woman also repeatedly &#8220;blew a whistle&#8221; during taping to distract Usher, who is a judge on the hit singing-competition show along withShakira, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton. According to sources close to the show, the 20-something audience member blew her whistle for about a minute during filming at NBC studios in Burbank, Calif. We&#8217;re told that only the show&#8217;s celebrity judges were on stage during the incident, sitting in their oversize red rotating judges chairs.
