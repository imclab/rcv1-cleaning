I was 12 and spent my allowance to buy it, and that was the beginning of my hummingbird collection, an eclectic collection of unique pieces from special places or special people. Hummingbirds remind me of the southwest where I spent much of my childhood and it was the place that inspired me artistically.&rdquo;&mdash;April Zay HOME | BIOGRAPHY | GALLERY | OIL PORTRAITS | ART LESSONS WORKSHOPS | ORIGAMI JEWELRY | EVENTS | CONTACT US
