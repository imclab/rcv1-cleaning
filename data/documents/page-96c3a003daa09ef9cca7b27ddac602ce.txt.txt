 Arts & Entertainment in Kosciusko County 
 Take time to be wowed 
 Every year, thousands of visitors descend upon Kosciusko County for the variety of arts and entertainment activities. We’re home to a professional symphony orchestra, a rarity for a community this size, and a world-class theatre where talented performers bring to life classic and new musical favorites. Painters, photographers, and jewelers craft and sell their work in county shops. Woodworkers and furniture makers shape fine pieces for your kitchen and home. And glass is cut in the same manner and on the same machinery as it has been in Warsaw since 1911.
