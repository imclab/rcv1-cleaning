But they repaired a rotor and pads at a more than fair price for parts and labor. Had to wait for part delivery, after that they had us fixed in about twenty minutes.

( More ) Cross Lanes Auto Repair is now the ONLY place I take my car. I have a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am. The water system and the engine of this vehicle are both very difficult and expensive to work on. Every time I've had problems they have fixed my car in at the most, three days. Not only will they cut you deals on labor and parts' expenses, they have the best, and most friendly customer service. My name is Oak E Milam and I've had my water pump, H20 cap, timing chains, and my traction control fixed here, all with excellent service. ( Hide ) Was this Review helpful to you?
