Â  ____________________ From the Artist Â  Â  I feel as though my relationship with watercolor painting turns out to be an accurate metaphor to describe my approach to creating art and music: Â  I love how watercolors work so well independently with just a little guidance of a brush stroke and a dab of water.Â  You don&#39;t really know what exactly is going to happen or what it will look like once it touches the page...which is very exciting! It is the same for art as it is for music- the multiple possibilities of what could happen, which takes place in improvision. I love those brief moments in which a melody is very freely being created. It feels like uncovering a path that was always there, but you just discovered it and so it is extremely uplifting and exciting! This is why the beginning of the songwriting process is most rewarding for me, as well as the first demos made of it. After it is set in stone or I have fussed with it too much, sometimes I feel it loses it&#39;s vivaciousness and intensity. In my more recent songs, I&#39;ve been aiming to maintain that sense of spontaneity and energy by recording my improvisons and leaving them unaltered, using them as the final take. It&#39;s all about chance, which ultimately brings up the question of fate and the freedom we possess- how we choose to live our lives and what we can discover. Â  I enjoy not being too in control of things because whatever I am making will not be as entertaining, honest, or at least nearly not as lively as I&#39;d like it to be if I interfere too much. It&#39;s the difference between writing or drawing with your bad hand over the dominant one. I prefer using my weaker hand because I may be able to learn something from its &#39;mistakes&#39;. I&#39;ve always greatly admired the work of visual artist, Paul Klee (1879-1940). I am drawn to the energy of his line drawings, which appear to look like the doodles a child might scribble. They are very minimal and simplistic yet the shakiness and spontaneity of the lines are full of emotion and life. Klee&#39;s line drawings feel like improvisation, completely uncorrected and unrestrained. Paul Klee&#39;s work makes me wonder what it would feel like to have a pencil and paper in front of me again as a child and to draw, before I had learned much about what I was actually doing.
