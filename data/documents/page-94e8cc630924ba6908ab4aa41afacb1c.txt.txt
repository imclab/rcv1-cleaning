WSU art professor keeps wit, humor alive after four decades of teaching Alex Beswerchij thesouthend.wayne.edu  |  0comments  Art professor Stanley Rosenthal’s wit and humor are still alive and well in his 43rd year at Wayne State. He began his journey at WSU as a graduate student from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. In 1969, he became a full-time teacher and is now the department’s graduate officer. Rosenthal was not born shy. In fact, he did stand-up comedy for a few years. Students say he has a sense of openness where he is comfortable to say whatever is on his mind. “Stanley has the ability to break up the normal in your day,” said Matt Lachowski, a graduate of WSU. The day I met him in the Art Building, although he had no idea who I was, he started talking to me about his artwork and even asked me to be a figure model for a piece in his current collection. Jennifer Belair, a graduate student and assistant to Rosenthal, said that in the two years that she’s known him, the two things she’d say about him were that he’s “honest and extremely knowledgeable.” Teaching has been a passion of his from the beginning. “Teaching never gets tiring. You get the opportunity to watch art students hatch into artists. Gradually these students discover their potential,” Rosenthal said. Some have been very successful. One in particular is now showing his art at the National Artists Gallery in Washington. Rosenthal teaches two, 3000-level printmaking classes per semester. The class is a studio course, and students are given the freedom to create their own ideas and projects. The classes typically meet twice a week for two hours and 45 minutes. Just as his students create new art, so does he. He is currently working on a new collection of images of female figures wearing different forms of elaborate jewelry. He has won numerous national and regional awards for his watercolor pieces and printwork. These include the top awards from Watercolor USA — twice — and the State of the Art National Watercolor Invitational — twice. When Rosenthal isn’t working, he enjoys spending time with his wife. They love to travel the world and experience new things. Over the years they’ve traveled to Ireland, Dwarf Holiday Beach in South California, Paris, The Mall of America and Yosemite National Park. He also enjoys bird watching and cooking.
