What do you recommend to remove the adhesive residue from the roof top? What's a good ballpark amount to pay out to have the factory rivets and trim mounts grinded down and the factory seams cleaned up and refilled with body filler and primed for paint? Answer Hi Wil, You can use an adhesive remover for removing the left over residue. As far as a estimate for the work you want done you'll need to check with an auto body repair shop for an accurate estimate. Here's some links for adhesive removers made by 3M which should work well: http://www.repaintsupply.com/pd_general_purpose_adhesive.cfm http://www.repaintsupply.com/pd_general_purpose.cfm http://www.repaintsupply.com/pd_woodgrain_and.cfm Questioner's Rating Rating(1-10) Knowledgeability = 10 Clarity of Response = 10 Politeness = 10 Comment No Comment Ask a Question Related Articles Questions and Answers - Auto Repair 1980 Cadillac Coupe Deville Heater Control Valve Cadillac Coupe DeVille Rear Main Seal Cadillac Coupe Deville Heater Problem 1966 Cadillac Coupe DeVille Rear Main Seal Installation Tool Auto body repair &amp; detailing All Answers Answers by Expert: Gary Michael Kakuk Dave Norgardt Dan Gardener Mark Haben Bob Ask Experts Volunteer Gary Expertise I can answer most questions on auto refinishing materials.
