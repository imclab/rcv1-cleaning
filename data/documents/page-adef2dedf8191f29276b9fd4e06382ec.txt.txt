The &#8216;Applause&#8217; cover is very artsy, and Gaga&#8217;s entire face is painted. Her eyes appear to be painted as tidal waves and her mouth as fire. I can&#8217;t help but think it looks like Gaga is being born in this photo. Heh. ARTPOP will be Lady Gaga&#8217;s third studio album. It hits shelves on November 11, 2013. Do you think ARTPOP will live up to her first two albums? &laquo; &laquo; PREVIOUS: Pro-Marijuana Ad To Air During NASCAR NEXT: Lindsay Lohan To Guest Host &#8216;Chelsea Lately&#8217; &raquo; &raquo;  Posted on: Lady Gaga    ABOUT US SEND US YOUR TIPS!
