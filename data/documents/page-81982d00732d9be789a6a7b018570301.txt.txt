Our family has been going for 11 years and they are having so much trouble with riff-raff and teenagers acting in unacceptable ways that they have BANNED ALL TEENAGERS (17 and under) from going to a movie without a 21 + year old accompanying them and sitting with them in the movie. Instead of just kicking out the troublemakers they choose to punish all the kids. AND they do not have any signs up or notices of this change in rules on their recording or website. 14-15-16 year olds are being stranded after their parents let them off and not allowed in. Thank God for cell phones.  1 year, 2 months ago Link to this comment |  Suggest removal What do you think?
