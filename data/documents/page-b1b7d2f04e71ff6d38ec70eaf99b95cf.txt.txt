&nbsp; 
 
 
 The family of Sholom Aleichem in conjunction with the Sholom Aleichem Memorial Foundation has created a website dedicated to his life and work. Sholom Aleichem, pen name for Solomon Rabinovitch, created a legacy for all people, Jewish and non-Jewish. Now through the means of the world wide web it is possible to reach out to a new generation of readers with the humor, pathos, and spirit of the World of SHOLOM ALEICHEM. Resources that will be built include 1) Bibliography of his works in English and other translated languages. 2) Outreach to Jewish schools throughout the world, enabling students to communicate with each other about topics generated by their interest in Sholom Aleichem. 3)Make available resources of Yiddish material to heighten its esteem in the eyes of educators and younger Jews. 4) Furnishing a curriculum of Sholom Aleichem's work for students and schools
