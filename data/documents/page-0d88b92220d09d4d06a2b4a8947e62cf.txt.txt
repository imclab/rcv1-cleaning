The Cross GT concept, which Kia is previewing with the photo above, will appear in the Windy City before the vaguely named Urban Vehicle two-door crossover-ish-looking show car bows at the Geneva show in March.  Although Kia hasn&#8217;t specified how large the Urban Vehicle concept is, the company is being quite forthcoming with the Cross GT, stating that it previews a premium crossover larger than the Sorento . We&#8217;re betting that this means the Cross GT could someday morph into a big three-row crossover to go against the likes of the Chevy Traverse, Nissan Pathfinder, and Ford Explorer. What&#8217;s interesting is that the Cross GT appears to feature Kia&#8217;s current &#8220;Tiger Nose&#8221; grille, a styling touch deliberately missing from the Urban Vehicle&#8217;s front end. The Cross GT also has a sharply raked roofline that terminates in a chopped rear end reminiscent of Kia&#8217;s Track&#8217;ster concept  from last year&#8217;s Chicago show, as well as a large, vertical fender vent located just aft of the front wheels. Instrumented Test: 2011 Kia Sportage SX Turbo AWD Instrumented Test: 2012 Kia Soul 1.6 Eco Instrumented Test: 2013 Kia Rio5 SX Manual We dig the Cross GT&#8217;s look, even when we put on our back-to-reality glasses that show a crossover with a normal roofline, smaller wheels, and (fingers crossed) no fender vent. Critically, Kia could use a large, three-row crossover in its lineup following the mercy killing of the wrong-car-at-the-wrong-time, body-on-frame, V-8–powered Borrego SUV.
