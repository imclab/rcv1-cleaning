(h/t Mary) The second features Ron Howard (as Opie and Richie Cunningham) voicing support for Obama with assistance from Andy Griffith and Henry Winkler. (h/t Allan) And the third is a new version of the old Bud "Wassup!" spot  that's been updated as a means of support for Obama . Finally, the liberal MoveOn.org allows Web surfers to customize a video for friends/enemies/frenemies. It's a faux news report on the one voter who failed to vote, leading to a McCain win. Here's one my friend Stephanie sent me . You can create your own here . And the Hillary Clinton version is here . If I found any funny pro-McCain/anti-Obama spots I'd post those too, but I haven't found them other than the "SNL" spots from the other day . If you know of any, post links below in the comments section. *** If you don't plan to watch the Obama show tonight, please check out ABC's "Pushing Daisies" (8 p.m., WTAE) as an alternative. It's an excellent, ratings-challenged series that could be canceled. If more viewers don't start watching, it doesn't have a prayer, which would be a shame. America should not be denied the charms of actress Kristin Chenoweth (pictured, right) on a weekly basis. More in this category: &laquo; OMG! It's snowing!
