 Adelaide Auto .com.au www.adelaideauto.com.au Home  Car Culture Sydney Morning Herald Thursday May 29, 1997 with Tony Davis ELFIN THIS AND ELFIN THAT You've seen the film, you've spun the disc, you've bought the poster, you'veworn the T-shirt, and now ... the book. Not quite, but the name Elfin deservesto be a lot better known than it is. Operating out of a ramshackle factory insuburban Adelaide, the tiny Elfin Sports Cars operation produced some of thegreat racing machines of the 1960s and 1970s. And now, finally, the many achievements of Elfin and its multi-talentedfounder Garrie Cooper have been captured in book form. Australia's Elfin Sportsand Racing Cars (Turton & Armstrong, $79.95) is the type of historical workwhich turns up very rarely because such fanatical recorders of facts and figures seldom (a) actually finish their task and (b) have the skills to make theresults interesting to people who aren't fascinated by discrepancies in lists of chassis numbers. Authors John Blanden and Barry Catford defy the odds. Elfin was the "largestand longest running racing car manufacturer in the Southern Hemisphere," theyexplain. The company built about 250 racing cars in 24 years. If that doesn't soundoverly productive, consider that writing this 200-page book took the two mennearly 17 years. Consider, too, that the Elfin tally included more than 20different models, and that each was designed in-house then hand-built, often toeccentric customer specifications. Cooper (designer, builder and successful racing driver) has been oftenlikened to Colin Chapman, the innovative Lotus founder. Cooper died in 1982 atjust 46, but not before Elfin had produced winners in just about every carracing category in Australia and notched up quite a number of notable overseas victories, too. It built some of the prettiest - and ugliest - cars ever madedownunder. This book has some rough edges, but the text is expansive and interesting,there are wonderful photos of Elfins in action, of Cooper, and the often chaotic conditions in which his cars were produced. There are also lots of charts,tables and lists for the chassis number set. James Hunt achieved his last motor sport victory in an Elfin, which has given the authors the excuse to include The Shunt's favourite joke, about a horsenamed Eric. Hunt's jest is only average but Australia's Elfin Sports and Racing Cars isway above that. Try a specialist book store, or phone the distributor,Bookworks, on (02) 9740 6766. VIRTUAL BATHURST Here it is: the first mainstream, locally produced CD-ROM racing game. Called Touring Car Champions and designed for home computer, this new game gives youthe opportunity to race at a very convincing circuit at Mount Panorama in aslightly less convincing Holden Commodore (even to do a full 1,000 km race ifyou've got the time and sufficiently square eyes.) Comparatively cheap at$49.95, Touring Car Champions is not one of the world's great computer games.But if you want to be Brockie or Lowndsie, and to drive around Bathurstie, thisis you're best chance to date. Produced by Virtual Sports Interactive and distributed by Home EntertainmentSuppliers (02-9773 0044), Touring Car Champions is available through majorcomputer games suppliers. JEEPERS CREEPERS Remember the "Give Way - Not" Jeep advertisement discussed a couple ofcolumns ago? An inside source has phoned to assure us that the macho Jeep photoillustrating the ad is a staged shot taken on the US's famed Rubicon Trail. Nothing remarkable there, except the "go-anywhere" machine was wedged intoplace. The dust which indicated movement was courtesy of whopping great fan locatedjust out of frame. DAIMLER BENDS On ABC radio news this month, the business reporter explained thatDaimler-Benz had developed a new system enabling people to be hooked up to theInternet as they drove, with the rear seat passengers surfing via screens on the back of the headrests. The reporter from the ABC added erroneously: "The system may be on Daimler cars within five years." That Daimler cars are not made by Daimler-Benz, butJaguar (a division of Ford) is a quirk of fate. In 1893, Frederick Simmsnegotiated to build German Daimler vehicles under licence in Britain - and tosell them under the original name. In 1926, the original German company, formed by Gottlieb Daimler, merged with the company started by Karl Benz to become Daimler-Benz. Benz's company hadalready established the name Mercedes (in honour of the daughter of French Benzdistributor Emil Jellinek) and, so the new name of Mercedes-Benz was used forcars from the merged company. The British company stuck with the Daimler name, even though it was swallowed by Jaguar in 1960 then, after a few more changes in ownership, ended up adivision of Ford by the end of the 1980s. You knew that, didn't you. STOPPING THE ROT An avid Drive reader (name withheld by request) has posed the question: "What do you call four tyres lying on the driveway?"

QUOTE UNQUOTE "It was a rich cream colour, bright with nickel, swollen here and there inits monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes,and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns." F.Scott Fitzgerald describes an automobile belonging to his best known character,Jay Gatsby, in the classic 1925 American novel The Great Gatsby. The brand ofcar was not specified.
