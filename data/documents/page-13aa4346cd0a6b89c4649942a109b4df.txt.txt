Adrienne (Ang) Gaither doesn&#8217;t confine herself to one medium, working in paint, digital graphic arts and organic sculpture, switching adroitly among them to best convey a message through her work. Mixed media artist and airbrush master Drew Storm Graham carves and constructs relief sculptures that are beautifully colored, working expertly with shading, gradient, shadows and three-dimensionality. Illustrator Jessica Rose views her art as an escape route from reality and a manifesto to defy convention. Susan Stacks&#8217; complex works in pencil, ink and watercolor are designed with painstaking detail and exhibit excruciating patience&#8212;thousands of tiny dots and dashes are arranged in a pattern-like way, creating works that are incredibly intricate and meditative.
