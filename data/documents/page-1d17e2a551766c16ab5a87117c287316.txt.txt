Hemmings Classic Car,June 2006(circ.: 36,000) "More than a few books chronicling the American road have passed through our inbox and been reviewed in these pages. When this one arrived, we groaned reflexively, figuring we'd found yet another volume joyously recounting the kitschy glories of Route 66. We were pleased, however, to learn that in this large-format paperback ... the authors fire a quick-shot series of features at literally all things automotive, or at least auto-related. "The brisk writing and reader-friendly style make this a good one-shot volume of what our hobby's all about."
