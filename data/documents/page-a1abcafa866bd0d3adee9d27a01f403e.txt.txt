It popped up in 1943 as a cheap form of transportation and since that time has provided millions of people with a great way to get around. A favorite amongst the custom crowd, and coming in only second to Harley-Davidson, owners tend to personalize their Vespa&#8217;s to reflect their own style. The following is not an advertisement, but simply, a graphical timeline that pays homage to one of the coolest little scoots on the planet.

All members of society that intrigue those of us who lead relatively normal lives. We see these folks and sometimes wonder how and why they choose to lead a life that goes against conformity and portrays them in a much more unfavorable light.

The Crazy Cart from RAZOR is an adolescent boys dream. It&#8217;s got one electric drive wheel under the steering column, a drift handle and a price tag that&#8217;s around $400.00. Is it expensive? Yes. However if you have dreams of your toddler becoming the next Ken Block or Tanner Foust, then spending 4 bills on the Crazy Cart may not be such a bad idea.

Posted in Best of , General , Pop Culture byMrAngry|June 27th, 2013|1 Response| These days classic cars are generally seen taking up space at car shows or as lawn ornaments on the neighbors driveway.

Thankfully for us, VWVortex.com has a 129 page post going on with some of the best vintage photos that can be found anywhere online. We&#8217;ve gathered together 20 of our favorites, but make sure to click on the link below to check out the rest. Some of them are simply epic!

Posted in Best of , General , Import Rides , People , Pop Culture , Rides , Toyota byMrAngry|June 22nd, 2013|5 Responses| Ever have a good car that you simply love to hate on? Mine was a 1989 Toyota Tercel like the one you see here and looking back on it, I feel truly guilty about the way I treated it. This car was all about basic transportation, which was something it did quite well and it deserved better than a young adult who simply wanted to beat on it and go fast. If you look at the spec sheet it&#8217;s really quite dismal. Power came from a 1.5L I4 that produced 78 hp and 87 lb-ft of torque through a 3-speed automatic with manual overdrive. Mine only had two options &#8211; the aforementioned automatic transmission and A/C. Everything else was bargain basement. It had an AM/FM radio with two speakers, crank windows, cloth seats and that was it.

They generally come to us by chance at a time when we need them the most, and reward us in ways we could never dream possible. This episode of Petrolicious is one of my favorites, and after watching I think you&#8217;ll see why.

As a kid, I distinctly remember that the only thing I wanted was my drivers license. SRT&#8217;s new advertising campaign gives us all, young and old, a little shot in the arm and reminds us that, even though technology is a wonderful thing, it&#8217;s nothing if it doesn&#8217;t stir the body and soul.

Posted in Cool Stuff , European Rides , General , Peugeot , Pop Culture , Racing , Rides , Top of the Heap byMrAngry|June 6th, 2013|Leave a Reply| If you&#8217;ve ever heard of Dick Dastardly &#038; Muttley, The Slag Brothers, Penelope Pitstop or The Ant Hill Mob, then you are the target audience for the new Peugeot 208. Released in 1968, the Wacky Races pitted 11 teams against each other in a series of cartoon races. There were hijinks, bombs and even one rather attractive heroine who drove a pink hot-rod. Peugeot&#8217;s newest ad campaign for the new 208 includes all your favorite characters from the Wacky Races, and is nothing short of brilliant.
