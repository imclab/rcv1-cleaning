 Editorial Reviews 
 
 
 
       Asked about what to expect from this collaboration with Edo G, Masta Ace fires back without hesitation; &#34;people are gonna be surprised when they hear the mixture of styles. We both have a different approach. It's like the old Reeses commercial... Ya got peanut butter walking down the street. Coming from the other direction is chocolate. Someone trips and blam, a peanut butter cup was born. Something new and amazing was created that no one had ever thought of!&#34; When one thinks of Boston and New York the first thing that comes to mind is the infamous Red Sox/Yankees rivalry. But this time when Boston meets New York it's a collaborative effort to bring the world one of the tightest Hip Hop efforts of 2009. Two of the games most exceptionally creative and well-rounded artists, Edo. G and Masta Ace bring the two cities together with Arts & Entertainment. Like their home cities, these artists have a long history and have influenced the world. Hailing from Brownsville, Brooklyn, Masta Ace got his proper introduction setting off the quintessential Hip Hop posse cut, &#34;The Symphony.&#34; Not long after, Edo G's debut Life Of A Kid In The Ghetto and its lead single &#34;I Got To Have It&#34; went to the top of the Billboard Rap Singles chart with heavy rotation on Yo! MTV Raps. Both Ace and Ed have continued to stay relevant, tour the globe, and influence up and coming artists everywhere. Joining the duo on Arts & Entertainment is a notable list of featured artists from NYC and the Bean including Posdanus of De La Soul, Large Professor, DJ Spinna, KRS-One, Mr. Lif, Akrobatik and Chester French. Production from Double O of Kidz in the Hall, M Phases, DJ Supreme One amd Frank Dukes round out this collabo from two mighty Hip Hop icons.

 More great music from Edo and Ace 
 November 17, 2009 
   
 By   Frank Eason 
 
     Format: Audio CD | Amazon Verified Purchase   
 
 This collaboration seems like it has been a long time in the making. Masta Ace and Edo.G are two kindred spirits in the Hip Hop world. Both came up during the same time, during the later stages of the Hip Hop Golden Era. They have done one song team ups before; but the full length album was worth the wait. Not overly long or full of too much filler. This album has a few skits but mainly hits you with track upon track of classic old school vibe; rock the mic, skills and talent. The album has a few guest stars, namely KRS-One, with Large Professor and Pasdanus. However, this CD is mainly about Edo and Ace. They both show they are still as potent on the MIC as ever. Illustrating the cuts with wordplay that's both witty, and especially for Edo, that's personal as well. It's always enlightening to hear an artist open up and not just speak about the material trappings that come with being famous. 1. Hands High = Great into cut setting the stage nicely. 2. A's & E's feat. Marsha Ambrosias = Another great cut. Marsha Ambrosious provides a lighter vibe which works well. 3. Fans feat. Large Professor = Great to see Large Pro back on wax. Makes for a good 3 man posse cut. 4. Little Young = Very witty, very true look at the name game in hip hop. 5. Ei8ht Is Enuff = Nice track, good back and forth wordplay between Edo and Ace. 6. Good Music feat. Posdanus = Always the best lyricist of De la Sol, Nus doesn't miss a beat on this cut. Another great posse track. 7. We Want It All feat. Mr. Lif = More home grown Boston. Mr. Lif grabs the mic and keeps things moving. 8. Authentic = Starts out with a snippet of Spoken Word and then moves onto the tract. Nice beat and works well. 9.  Pass The Mic feat. KRS-One = The Blast Master on the cut! What more needs be said? Great track from beginning to end. Nice old school feeling beat too. 10. Round And Round = Nice cut detailing life in travel. 11. Whoomp = Nice beat, great lyrics. 12. Reminds Me = Awesome track. Edo and Ace get personal and open up on this cut. Not all is bubbly in the rap game and it's nice to hear some much needed reality. 13. Here I Go = Edo And Ace, with mics in hand. 14. Dancing Like a W.G. = Could be the commercial hit of the CD. Funny, funny track, good beat and the hook is real catchy.   Read more &rsaquo;

  Nice cd by EdOG and Masta Ace. Have always been an Ace fan and adding EdOG was a nice touch. My favorite is Eight is Enough. If you're into old school hip-hop, I definitely suggest that you buy it.

 The Best Chemistry Since EPMD - Like Brown & Beige 
 April 23, 2010 
   
 By   Real Hip Hop Will Never Die 
 
   Format: Audio CD   
 
  This is definately the best album to drop in 2009.  Hip Hop veterans Masta Ace and Edo G come hard with the one two style over smooth yet banging beats.  Production was well done as the beats perfectly complement the craft that these two legends have been perfecting for over 20 years.  There is a perfect balance of guest emcees on this one including Large Professor, who drops one of the best verses I've ever heard on the song "Fans".  KRS-One shows up to blaze the mic as well. The lyrics Ace & Edo drop are on point and these two have an artistic chemestry that matches EPMD.  This album is Hip Hop in it's purest form.  Something we don't get to see very often.  So don't sleep on this one, it is well worth the purchase.  #1 of 2009 in this reviewer's opinion, and I've been emersed in Hip Hop for 25 years.

  Good album.  Lots of good tracks.  Could have done without some of the skits and the last song (Dancin' like a white girl) is TERRIBLE.  They should have gotten rid of a couple of the skits and the last song and put a couple other tracks on there. But the overall album is really good if you want to kind of revisit the old school days of hip hop.  Masta Ace really shines on this album and overshadows Edo a little bit, but I don't want to knock Edo G... he can definitely hold his own.

 Solid Album...   
 
  Although there are too many skits and a horrible Chester french song, this album was pretty dope. Without those missteps, it's an album you can play all the way through without...  Read more

 Could have been better   
 
  I was excited when I read that Masta Ace & Edo G would join forces to drop an album. I automatically thought this was gonna be one of the greatest releases of the year and I'd play...  Read more
