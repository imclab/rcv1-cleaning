Prominent Egyptian actress Khairiyeh Ahmad. Ahmad Saeed and Reem Al Baroudi. Renowned Saudi director Mamdouh Salem. For someone that is continuously voted one of the most beautiful female stars in the Arab world, Haifa Wehbe is surprisingly down-to-Earth. The Lebanese singer, actress and businesswoman is possibly one of the nicest women artists in Middle Eastern showbiz; she's constantly communicating with fans via her official Twitter page (@HaifaWehbe), she always has time for her fans and the media during public appearances, and now, the singer has posted her latest single, Badde Shoof Be 3ainak Hob online, free for all her fans to share. Despite a few difficulties with record company Rotana &mdash; meaning she hasn't been able to release a new record for some time &mdash; Haifa's career is going from strength to strength. Not only is her current single one of her most requested on radio stations to date, but she's one of the few Arab celebrities that has crossed over to the international scene. Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli is a fan, and a number of artists, including Shaggy, David Vendetta and Snoop Dogg have collaborated with her. Fresh from her latest appearance in Dubai for the opening of nightlife concept Cirque Du Soir, Haifa reveals details about her upcoming release, as well as what really is going on with Rotana.  You launched Cirque Du Soir in Dubai recently. Tell us a little bit more about it. Cirque Du Soir is a famous concept in the UK that's attended by many international celebrities. This Dubai event marks the first venue of its kind in the Middle East, and I am the first Arab to launch this concept. It's a concept that combines nightlife with circus elements. They're opening the next one in Lebanon. Badde Shoof Be 3ainak Hob is receiving fantastic air play. Did you expect this success? I am very happy with the song. I launched it during Eid Al Adha, when I opened a show with it. Following that performance, my fans started to ask me for the song, so I decided to post it on Twitter as a gift for my fans. The fans are really happy with it, and their feedback has really made me love the song even more. You're one of the few Arab singers very active on social media... I love Twitter &mdash; I use it more than Facebook and other social media sites. It has offered the opportunity to get me closer to my fans, and it is a great tool for people to know my news, because it is a verified account. I post everything myself, so I am responsible for the content. The song release has apparently prompted Rotana to order radio stations to not play it due to contractual reasons. What do you have to say about this? The song is mine, therefore I am responsible for it. I did not release it via Rotana. I posted it on Twitter, I sang it. If any radio station wants to play it, they can do so. I am responsible for it. Why don't they call me and talk to me about this rather than stop stations from playing it? You cannot stop success. If something is destined for you, it will happen. So what is going on with Rotana? I do not have a problematic relationship with Rotana. All that happened in the past was that I expressed concern over the delay in the production of my album, so that's all. I was frustrated that things were not moving. That is all. Are you working on new material? Yes, my new album will have a lot of nice songs that I am excited about. What surprised me is that fans really got excited about the latest single as soon as it went out. Usually, new songs take a little while to get used to. So I am excited about the next record. Finally, what are your plans for NYE? I'll be performing with the great artist Ragheb Alame, who I love and respect very much. We've performed several times before, and it seems that the fans really like the combination of Ragheb and I, so its something we decided to do again. Dont miss it: Haifa Wehbe will be performing at Cavalli Club Dubai on November 30 at a lavish evening of dinner, drinks and dance. Doors open at 8pm. For tickets, priced Dh850, which includes an Arabic menu and one welcome drink, call 04-3329260 or 050-8566044. RIP, Khairiyeh Prominent Egyptian actress Khairiyeh Ahmad has passed away at the age of 74 after a long battle with lung cancer. Earlier this week, it had been revealed that the actress was taken to hospital, but that her condition was improving and she was in high spirits after receiving numerous visits from friends and family. Khairiyeh was considered one of the icons of Egyptian comedy and has acted in over 60 films. Some of her work includes Al Fanoos Al Sihri and Saher Al Nisa. Ahmad and Reem call it a day Ahmad Saeed and Reem Al Baroudi have split up just days before publicly announcing an official engagement, it has been reported. According to sources close to the Egyptian couple, the singer and actress were romantically involved, and while Saeed proposed, an engagement celebration was yet to take place. Meanwhile, Saeed later appeared on the television show Al Wasat Al Fani, confirming the split. &quot;Any man would dream of being involved with Reem, and we were together, but the relationship just reached a dead end,&quot; he said. Coming soon: Saudi Arabian Film Festival Following the success of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha, one more film festival is set to be launched in the GCC region next year. Preparations are currently under way for the debut of the Saudi Arabian Film Festival, which will aim at supporting regional productions as well as expand the film business in the country. Renowned Saudi director Mamdouh Salem &mdash; who was the first to launch a film festival in his home country when he created an event in 2006 &mdash; said the new festival will be different from all other international film festivals, as it will be completely televised on a well-known satellite channel that is yet to be revealed.
