   World of Auto Enthusiasts Men Addiction! The real porn... has 4 Wheels!  Pages RECENT POSTS IC Engine ETCG Fifth Gear    Wednesday, 29 May 2013 2014 Mercedes E-Class Coupe Though the S-Class is the profit-per-unit world champion, Mercedes' stalwart E-Class is still the company's most reliable producer of profits. The latter tends to represent the model that most humans on Earth think of when they think of Mercedes-Benz . The taxi version of the E-Class sedan used in Europe and elsewhere is the usual reason given for this familiarity we all have with the E, but c'mon, it also happens to be a pretty stunning piece of work in its market segment. Today we're trying the upgraded and massaged fourth-generation Mercedes E-Class Coupe (known internally as C207). Specifically we're driving the 329-horsepower E400 coupe that arrives in the US next summer (2014) to eventually replace &#8211; in all body variants &#8211; the current V8-powered E550. Starting price for a base E350 coupe should scare up $51,500 when it arrives a little later this year, while this E400 two-door will hit US soil at around $56,000 as a futuristic-sounding 2015 model.
