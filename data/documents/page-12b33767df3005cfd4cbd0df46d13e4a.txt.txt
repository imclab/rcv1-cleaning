It was part of a revolt against the social consequences of aristocracy and the political consequences of the Enlightenment. In art, the central themes of Romanticism were criticisms of the past, and an emphasis on heroics. The French Revolution was regarded as the heroic struggle of the lower classes against aristocrats and an unfair government. The central theme of Romanticism is the idea that the human race is perfectible. 1800-1860 Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote The American Scholar , Self-Reliance Part of the Transcendentalist movement His philosophies helped to shape the mid-19th century New Thought Movement Was an abolitionist Famously asked Henry David Thoreau, &amp;quot;Do you keep a journal?&amp;quot; Literature Henry David Thoreau Wrote Civil Disobedience , Walden Famously spent a night in jail for refusing to pay his taxes Is sometimes cited as an inspiration for anarchists Conducted experiments in simple living Part of the Transcendentalist movement Literature Edgar Allan Poe Wrote The Raven Best known for intense, dark stories Linked to Horror fiction, and Romanticism Was partially inspired in his later writings after the death of his15-year-old wife Once claimed of the Transcendentalists that &amp;quot;only the pretenders and sophists among them&amp;quot; Literature Nathaniel Hawthorne Wrote The Scarlet Letter , The House of the Seven Gables Part of the (Dark) Romantic Movement Wrote mainly short stories Many of his stories were set in New England Puritan society Though married to a Transcendentalist, later writings revealed criticisms of the movement Literature Thomas Cole “ Romantic Landscape with Ruined Tower” Also tried his hand at architecture Primarily painted landscapes, as well as allegorical works Lived in the Catskill Mountains for one summer, drawing Fort Putnam’s ruins Often painted melancholy scenes Art Albert Bierstadt Part of the Hudson River School Completed over 500 paintings in his lifetime, but some estimate that number could be as high as 4,000 Used very large canvases Used vivid, exaggerated colors Inspired by the American West Art Frederic Edwin Church Landscape Painter Traveled to South America between 1853 and 1857 A pupil of Thomas Cole Part of the Romantic Movement His painting, The Heart of the Andes sold for $10,000 in 1859, then the highest price paid for an American artist’s work Art The Hudson River School An American art movement Created by a group of landscape painters Heavily influenced by Romantic style Was not an actual school, but a group of people with a common creative vision meant to inspire each other Venerated in America’s natural beauty, along with contemporary American Writers Art BY: Tori  Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Twitter Find us on Facebook Find us on Google+ Learn About Us About Careers Our Blog Press Contact Us Help &amp; Support Using SlideShare SlideShare 101 Terms of Use Privacy Policy Copyright &amp; DMCA Community Guidelines SlideShare on Mobile Pro &amp; more Go PRO Enterprise Sales PRO Features Developers &amp; API Developers Section Developers Group Engineering Blog Blog Widgets &copy; 2013 SlideShare Inc.
