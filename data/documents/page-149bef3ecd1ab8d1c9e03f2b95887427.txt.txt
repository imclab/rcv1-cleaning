Review: "Nathan for You"  1comment  Posted on February 28, 2013  by  David Dunn Now here is what reality TV is supposed to be: a smartly executed idea that begins on a high note and just nosedives into a downward spiral of doom. Host Nathan Fielder goes through his shares of ups and downs, but its not that when he fails the show fails along with him. It’s when the spiraling happens where the biggest laughs kick in. Similar to how Gordon Ramsey visits restaurants and kick-starts their popularity in "Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares," Canadian comedian Nathan Fielder also goes on rescue sprees on failing businesses and attempts to jump-start their successes by offering innovative and unorthodox marketing suggestions to bump up traffic in their businesses. Among these ideas are a 8-minute delivery guarantee for a Pizza parlor when it takes 10 minutes to cook the pizza and a feces-flavored ice cream at a frozen yogurt shop. Yes, both of these ideas sound stupid. But there is genius in Fielder’s plots, and viewers never see it until later on in the episode. The elaboration on Fielder’s schemes are sheer brilliance in "Nathan For You," and even though they at first seem like bombshells of ideas, they expand to something far brilliant and funnier than expected. That’s not to say that his ideas aren’t prone to failure. It just means that its shocking and exciting when his plans work and quirky and hilarious when they don’t. That’s the genius of it: viewers can enjoy the show no matter the turnout. Let’s take a moment also, to elaborate on Nathan’s job as the show host. He’s more intuitive and qualified than you would predict. Before he became a comedian, he actually studied school in Canada and got a business degree. Both of his professions are shown wonderfully in this inverted, hilarious show. As a businessman, Nathan is creative and insightful, reacting to what he’s been taught and trying to apply his lessons to the businesses he’s trying to help. As a comedian and host, however, Fielder is masterful. He’s the kinda guy that would enter a job interview with a turtle named Ted giving him voice directions through a secret line. Yes, you read that right. A turtle. Named Ted. No, the turtle isn’t fake. No, his applicants didn’t know he was repeating what the turtle said. Yes, he got the job. There are two shows premiering on the Thursday slot on the Comedy Channel: "Nathan For You" and "The Ben Show." Go and watch "Nathan For You." It’s a funny show, the ideas are outlandishly innovative and Fielder is likable and fun as the shows host. @dDUnn87 davidadunn@mavs.uta.edu [if IE 6]> <link media="screen" href="http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theshorthorn.com/content/tncms/live/components/core_social_share/resources/styles/social_share_ie6.css?_dc=1375299420" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> <![endif]  Discuss Print  Posted in Movies and tv  on  Thursday, February 28, 2013 7:37 pm.
