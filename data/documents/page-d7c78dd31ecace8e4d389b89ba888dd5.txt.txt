What They Do -&gt; What Craft and Fine Artists Do About this section Craft and fine artists use a variety of materials and techniques to create art for sale and exhibition. Craft and fine artists use a variety of materials and techniques to create art for sale and exhibition. Craft artists create handmade objects, such as pottery, glassware, textiles or other objects that are designed to be functional. Fine artists, including painters, sculptors, and illustrators, create original works of art for their aesthetic value, rather than a functional one. Duties Craft and fine artists typically do the following: Use techniques such as knitting, weaving, glass blowing, painting, drawing, or sculpting Develop creative ideas or new methods for making art Create sketches, templates, or models to guide their work Select which materials to use on the basis of color, texture, strength, and other qualities Process materials, often by shaping, joining, or cutting Use visual elements, such as composition, color, space, and perspective, to produce desired artistic effects Develop portfolios highlighting their artistic styles and abilities to show to gallery owners and others interested in their work Artists create objects that are beautiful or thought-provoking. They often strive to communicate ideas or feelings through their art. Craft artists make a wide variety of objects, mostly by hand, to sell in their own studios, online, in stores, or at arts-and-crafts shows. Some craft artists display their works in galleries and museums. Craft artists work with many different materials, including ceramics, glass, textiles, wood, metal, and paper, to create unique pieces of art, such as pottery, quilts, stained glass, furniture, jewelry, and clothing. Many craft artists also use fine-art techniquesâfor example, painting, sketching, and printingâto add finishing touches to their products. Fine artists typically display their work in museums, commercial or non-profit art galleries, corporate collections, and private homes. Some of their artwork may be commissioned (requested by a client), but most is sold by the artist or through private art galleries or dealers. The gallery and the artist decide in advance how much of the sale proceeds each will keep. Some craft and fine artists spend much time and effort selling their artwork to potential customers or clients and building a reputation. However, only the most successful artists are able to support themselves solely through the sale of their works. Many artists have at least one other job to support their craft or art careers. Some artists work in museums or art galleries as arts directors or as curators, planning and setting up exhibits. Others teach craft or art classes or conduct workshops in schools or in their own studios. For more information on workers who teach art classes, see the profiles on kindergarten and elementary school teachers , middle school teachers , high school teachers , postsecondary teachers , and self-enrichment teachers . Craft and fine artists specialize in one or more types of art. The following are examples of types of craft and fine artists: Cartoonists draw political, advertising, comic, and sports cartoons. Some cartoonists work with others who create the idea or story and write captions. Some create plots and write captions themselves. Most cartoonists have comic, critical, or dramatic talents in addition to drawing skills. Ceramic artists shape, form, and mold artworks out of clay, often using a potterâs wheel and other tools. They glaze and fire pieces in kilns, which are special furnaces that dry and harden the clay. Fiber artists use fabric, yarn, or other natural and synthetic fibers to weave, knit, crochet, or sew textile art. They may use a loom to weave fabric, needles to knit or crochet yarn, or a sewing machine to join pieces of fabric for quilts or other handicrafts. Fine art painters paint landscapes, portraits, and other subjects in a variety of styles, ranging from realistic to abstract. They may use one or more media, such as watercolors, oil paints, or acrylics. Furniture makers cut, sand, join, and finish wood and other materials to make handcrafted furniture. For more information about other workers who assemble wood furniture, see the profile on woodworkers . Glass artists process glass in a variety of waysâsuch as by blowing, shaping, or joining itâto create artistic pieces. Specific processes used include glassblowing, lampworking, and stained glass. These workers also decorate glass objects, such as by etching or painting. Illustrators create pictures for books, magazines, and other publications, and for commercial products, such as textiles, wrapping paper, stationery, greeting cards, and calendars. Increasingly, illustrators use computers in their work. They might draw in pen and pencil and then scan the image into a computer to be colored in, or use a special pen to draw images directly onto the computer. Sketch artists , a particular type of illustrator, often create likenesses of subjects with pencil, charcoal, or pastels. Sketches are used by law enforcement agencies to help identify suspects, by the news media to show courtroom scenes, and by individual customers for their own enjoyment. Jewelry artists use metals, stones, beads, and other materials to make objects for personal adornment, such as earrings or bracelets. For more information about other workers who create jewelry, see the profile on jewelers and precious stone and metal workers . Medical and scientific illustrators combine drawing skills with knowledge of biology or other sciences. Medical illustrators work with computers or with pen and paper to create images of human anatomy and surgical procedures, as well as three-dimensional models and animations. Scientific illustrators draw animal and plant life, atomic and molecular structures, and geologic and planetary formations. These illustrations are used in medical and scientific publications and in audiovisual presentations for teaching purposes. Some medical and scientific illustrators work for lawyers, producing exhibits for court cases. Printmakers create images on a silk screen, woodblock, lithography stone, metal etching plate, or other type of matrix. The matrix is then inked and transferred to a piece of paper using a printing press or hand press to create the final work of art. Workers who do photoengraving are called printing workers. For more information, see the profile on printing workers . Sculptors design three-dimensional works of art, either by molding and joining materials such as clay, glass, plastic, or metal, or by cutting and carving forms from a block of plaster, wood, or stone. Some sculptors combine various materials to create mixed-media installations. For example, some incorporate light, sound, and motion into their works. &lt;- Summary Work Environment -&gt; Work Environment About this section Many artists work in fine art or commercial art studios located in office buildings, warehouses, or lofts. Craft and fine artists held about 56,900 jobs in 2010. Most craft and fine artists are self-employed, while others are employed in various private sector industries and by government. Craft artists, for example, might work for companies that manufacture glass or clay products, or for museums, historical sites, or similar institutions. Fine artists are often employed by newspaper, periodical, book, and directory publishers; colleges and universities; and software publishers. Other types of artists and related workers work for the federal government, motion picture and video production companies, and advertising and public relations firms. Craft and fine artists commonly work in the following industries: Performing arts, spectator sports, and related industries 10% Federal government 8 Motion picture and video industries 5 Manufacturing 4 Educational services; state, local, and private 3 Many artists work in fine art or commercial art studios located in office buildings, warehouses, or lofts. Others work in private studios in their homes. Some artists share studio space, where they also may exhibit their work. Studios are usually well-lighted and ventilated. However, artists may be exposed to fumes from glue, paint, ink, and other materials. They may also have to deal with dust or other residue from filings, splattered paint, or spilled cleaners and other fluids. Work Schedules Part-time and variable work schedules are common for artists. Many also hold another job in addition to their work as an artist. During busy periods, artists may work overtime to meet deadlines. Self-employed artists can set their own hours. &lt;- What They Do How to Become One -&gt; How to Become a Craft or Fine Artist About this section Craft and fine artists create sketches, templates, or models to guide their work. Formal schooling is not required for craft and fine artists. However, many artists take classes or earn a bachelorâs or masterâs degree in fine arts, which can improve their skills and job prospects.Â  Education Formal schooling is rarely required for craft and fine artists. However, it is difficult to gain adequate artistic skills without some formal education in the fine arts. Most craft and fine artists have at least a high school diploma. High school classes, such as those in art, shop, or home economics, can teach prospective artists some of the basic skills they will need, such as drawing, woodworking, or sewing. Many artists pursue postsecondary education and take classes or earn degrees that can improve their skills and job prospects. Many colleges and universities offer bachelor's and master's degrees in fine arts. In addition to studio art and art history, courses may also include core subjects, such as English, social science, and natural science. Independent schools of art and design also offer postsecondary training, which can lead to a certificate in an art-related specialty or to an associateâs, bachelor's, or masterâs degree in fine arts. In 2011, the National Association of Schools of Art and Design accredited approximately 300 postsecondary institutions with programs in art and design. Most of these schools award a degree in art. Medical illustrators must have both a demonstrated artistic ability and a detailed knowledge of living organisms, surgical and medical procedures, and human and animal anatomy. They usually need a bachelor's degree combining art and premedical courses. However, most medical illustrators also choose to get a master's degree in medical illustration. Four accredited schools offer this degree in the United States. Education gives artists an opportunity to develop a portfolioâa collection of an artistâs work that demonstrates his or her styles and abilities. Portfolios are essential because art directors, clients, and others look at an artistâs portfolio when deciding whether to hire the individual or buy his or her work. Those who want to teach fine arts at public elementary or secondary schools usually must have a teaching certificate in addition to a bachelor's degree. An advanced degree in fine arts or arts administration is usually necessary for management or administrative positions in government or in foundations, or for teaching in colleges and universities. For more information on workers who teach art classes, see the profiles on kindergarten and elementary school teachers , middle school teachers , high school teachers , postsecondary teachers , and self-enrichment teachers . Training Craft and fine artists improve their skills through practice and repetition. They can train in several ways other than, or in addition to, attending formal schooling. Some craft and fine artists learn on the job from more experienced artists. Others attend non-credit classes or workshops or take private lessons, which may be offered in artistsâ studios or at community colleges, art centers, galleries, museums, or other art-related institutions. Still other craft and fine artists work closely with another artist on either a formal or informal basis. Formal arrangements may include internships or apprenticeship programs. Advancement Artists hired by firms often start with relatively routine work. While doing this work, however, they may observe other artists and practice their own skills. Craft and fine artists advance professionally as their work circulates and as they establish a reputation for a particular style. Many of the most successful artists continually develop new ideas, and their work often evolves over time. Many artists do freelance work while continuing to hold a full-time job until they are established as professional artists. Others freelance part time while still in school to develop experience and to build a portfolio of published work. Freelance artists try to develop a set of clients who regularly contract for work. Some freelance artists are widely recognized for their skill in specialties such as cartooning or children's book illustration. These artists may earn high incomes and can choose the type of work they do. Important Qualities Artistic ability. Craft and fine artists create artwork and other objects that are visually appealing or thought-provoking. This usually requires significant skill in one or more art forms. Creativity. Artists must have active imaginations to develop new and original ideas for their work. Customer-service skills. Craft and fine artists, especially those who sell their work themselves, must be good at dealing with customers and potential buyers. Interpersonal skills. Artists often must interact with many people, including co-workers, gallery owners, and the public. Manual dexterity. Most artists work with their hands and must be good at manipulating tools and materials to create their art. Sales and marketing skills. Craft and fine artists must promote themselves and their art to build a reputation and to sell what they have made. They often study the market for their crafts or artwork to increase their understanding of what potential customers might want. &lt;- Work Environment Pay -&gt; Pay About this section Craft and Fine Artists Median hourly wages, May 2010 Artists and Related Workers, All Other $28.29 Fine Artists, Including Painters, Sculptors, and Illustrators $21.56 Craft and Fine Artists $20.90 Total, All Occupations $16.27 Craft Artists $12.95 Note: All Occupations includes all occupations in the U.S. Economy.

Others, such as well-established freelance fine artists and illustrators, can earn more than salaried artists. Many, however, find it difficult to rely solely on income earned from selling paintings or other works of art. Part-time and variable work schedules are common for artists. Many also hold another job in addition to their work as an artist. During busy periods, artists may work overtime to meet deadlines. Self-employed artists can set their own hours. &lt;- How to Become One Job Outlook -&gt; Job Outlook About this section Craft and Fine Artists Percent change in employment, projected 2010-20 Total, All Occupations 14% Fine Artists, Including Painters, Sculptors, and Illustrators 8% Craft Artists 7% Craft and Fine Artists 5% Artists and Related Workers, All Other 1% Note: All Occupations includes all occupations in the U.S. Economy. Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment Projections program Employment of craft and fine artists is projected to grow by 5 percent from 2010 to 2020, slower than the average for all occupations. Employment growth of artists depends in large part on the overall state of the economy, because purchases of art are usually optional. During good economic times, more people and businesses are interested in buying artwork; during economic downturns, they buy less. Although there is always a demand for art by collectors and museums, the employment of artists is also impacted by the level of charitable giving to the artsâwhich has been decreasing in recent years. In addition, job growth for craft artists may be limited by the sale of inexpensive, mass-produced items designed to look like handmade American crafts. However, consumersâ continued interest in locally-made products will likely offset some of these employment losses. Demand for illustrators who work on a computer will increase as media companies use more detailed images and backgrounds in their designs. Illustrators and cartoonists who work in publishing may see job opportunities decline as traditional print publications lose ground to other media forms. However, new opportunities are expected to arise as the number of electronic magazines and Internet-based publications grows. Job Prospects Competition for jobs as craft and fine artists is expected to be strong because there are more qualified candidates than available jobs. Only the most successful craft and fine artists receive major commissions for their work. Despite the competition, studios, galleries, and individual clients are always on the lookout for artists who display outstanding talent, creativity, and style. Talented individuals who have developed a mastery of artistic techniques and skills will have the best job prospects. Competition among artists for the privilege of being shown in galleries is expected to remain intense, as will competition for grants from funders such as private foundations, state and local arts councils, and the National Endowment for the Arts. Because of their reliance on grants, and because the demand for artwork is dependent on consumers having extra income to spend, many of these artists will find that their income changes with the overall economy.
