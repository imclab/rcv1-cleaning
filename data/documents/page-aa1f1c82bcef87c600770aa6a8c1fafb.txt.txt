Today, South Carolina’s network of more than 250 automotive manufacturing plants and ground-transportation-related companies and suppliers represents a major sector of the state’s economy. From Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to Tier One and Tier Two suppliers that provide systems, sub-systems, components and materials, the South Carolina automotive industry is thriving. More than 33,000 people work in ground transportation-related manufacturing and automotive plants in South Carolina, and more work in distribution and logistics. A recent study by the University of South Carolina found that the state’s automotive and ground transportation industry represents at least 85,000 full-time equivalent jobs, more than 5% of the state’s employment base. In addition, jobs in other industries—from electronics to plastics to textiles—support automotive manufacturers in South Carolina.
