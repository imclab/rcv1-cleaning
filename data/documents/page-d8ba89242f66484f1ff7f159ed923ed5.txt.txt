I ordered your info today from your site. Thanks for the info, if it is correct and true, which I assume it is, it was worth the money. I was wondering if you could tell me how the taxes work on his end. The dealer that is. If the paperwork is done at his place than the title paperwork and stuff has the profit and cost and such on his name right? So why does he not charge you what the government will charge him as far as taxes go. Is it because all the profit goes to you and you pay the taxes on the profit or what? I am new to the tax thing. I have been pondering buying and selling cars for a while on the side. I am currentlya mechanic and could really use a change in employment. Any additional info on the specifics of the governments hand in the title transfer and the taxes would be of great help to me. I know this is a lot of questions to be asking at one time but I did buy the info off the site and it would really help me if you could answer these questions so I can become like you. Thanks again for the info. -Ryan P.S. : Do you know if this doesn't work in some states? I live in Louisiana and was thinking about moving to California.
