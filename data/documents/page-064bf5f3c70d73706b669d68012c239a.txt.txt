Photos Top 20 romantic movies 10 great Boston films Critics Ty Burr and Mark Feeney offer up contenders for the best Boston flick ever. Featured reviews 'Ain't Them Bodies Saints' guns for familiar territory David Lowery has set out to make a precise, self-conscious -- and often staggeringly beautiful -- emulation of the &#146;70s work of Robert Altman and Terence Malick. Find showtimes and theaters Is Ben Affleck the right choice to play Batman? The Cambridge-raised actor will star as Batman in the sequel to "Man of Steel." But is he right for the role? Names Ben Affleck cast as Batman 'The World's End' &#147;The World&#146;s End&#148; is more frantic than funny, but it&#146;s still funny enough -- just -- to outweigh its own silliness. It&#146;s hard to dislike a movie that blames the Internet on aliens. Find showtimes and theaters 'You're Next' Adam Wingard&#146;s sly, diabolical, and oddly moral &#147;You&#146;re Next&#148; draws on the home invasion/haunted house scenario, but outclasses them with its wit, irony, and technically proficient terror. Find showtimes and theaters 'Cutie and the Boxer' In this alternately whimsical and grim documentary, Zachary Heinzerling relates a couple&#146;s down-and-out, inspiring saga, which slyly comments on the ironies of the past half century in contemporary art. Find showtimes and theaters 'The Butler' &#147;The Butler&#148; rests on a gimmick, and a pretty good gimmick at that: The story of an African-American butler (Forest Whitaker) for seven White House administrations, from Eisenhower through Reagan. Find showtimes and theaters 'Jobs' This biopic reduces the life of the late founder of Apple to a series of inspirations, tirades, and motivational speeches set in corporate boardrooms. It seems like an extended Apple ad, but less entertaining. Find showtimes and theaters Pictures Biopics: Do these actors look the part? 'The Spectacular Now' &#147;The Spectacular Now&#148; is a cleareyed, disarmingly tender teenage romance that bears comparison with the best of its genre, both old and new. Find showtimes and theaters 'Prince Avalanche' Not much happens besides arguing and joking in this character study, but the performances and ghostly, melancholic atmosphere make it satisfying twist on the male buddy film. Find showtimes and theaters 'Kick-Ass 2' A witless, mean-spirited sequel, &#147;Kick-Ass 2&#148; has the emotional maturity of an arrested 12-year-old and the ethical compass of a turnip. Find showtimes and theaters 'Elysium' This is an expertly-made slice of future shock that breaks no new ground whatsoever. Lots of action with Matt Damon, a muddled social message, and Jodie Foster in arguably the worst performance of her career.
