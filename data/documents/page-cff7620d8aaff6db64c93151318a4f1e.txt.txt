Page of 0  Filter Time Any Time Today Last Week Last Month Filtered by: Clear All  Announcement Announcement Module Collapse Updated Baseball Fever Policy Baseball Fever Policy I. Purpose of this announcement: This announcement describes the policies pertaining to the operation of Baseball Fever. Baseball Fever is a moderated baseball message board which encourages and facilitates research and information exchange among fans of our national pastime. The intent of the Baseball Fever Policy is to ensure that Baseball Fever remains an extremely high quality, extremely low &quot;noise&quot; environment. Baseball Fever is administrated by three principal administrators: webmaster - Baseball Fever Owner The Commissioner - Baseball Fever Administrator Macker - Baseball Fever Administrator And a group of forum specific super moderators. The role of the moderator is to keep Baseball Fever smoothly and to screen posts for compliance with our policy. The moderators are ALL volunteer positions, so please be patient and understanding of any delays you might experience in correspondence. II. Comments about our policy: Any suggestions on this policy may be made directly to the webmaster . III. Acknowledgments: This document was based on a similar policy used by SABR . IV. Requirements for participation on Baseball Fever: Participation on Baseball Fever is available to all baseball fans with a valid email address, as verified by the forum's automated system, which then in turn creates a single validated account. Multiple accounts by a single user are prohibited. By registering, you agree to adhere to the policies outlined in this document and to conduct yourself accordingly. Abuse of the forum, by repeated failure to abide by these policies, will result in your access being blocked to the forum entirely. V. Baseball Fever Netiquette: Participants at Baseball Fever are required to adhere to these principles, which are outlined in this section. a. All posts to Baseball Fever should be written in clear, concise English, with proper grammar and accurate spelling. The use of abbreviations should be kept to a minimum; when abbreviation is necessary, they should be either well-known (such as etc.), or explained on their first use in your post. b. Conciseness is a key attribute of a good post. c. Quote only the portion of a post to which you are responding. d. Standard capitalization and punctuation make a large difference in the readability of a post. TYPING IN ALL CAPITALS is considered to be &quot;shouting&quot;; it is a good practice to limit use of all capitals to words which you wish to emphasize. e. It is our policy NOT to transmit any defamatory or illegal materials. f. Personal attacks of any type against Baseball Fever readers will not be tolerated. In these instances the post will be copied by a moderator and/or administrator, deleted from the site, then sent to the member who made the personal attack via a Private Message (PM) along with a single warning. Members who choose to not listen and continue personal attacks will be banned from the site. g. It is important to remember that many contextual clues available in face-to-face discussion, such as tone of voice and facial expression, are lost in the electronic forum. As a poster, try to be alert for phrasing that might be misinterpreted by your audience to be offensive; as a reader, remember to give the benefit of the doubt and not to take umbrage too easily. There are many instances in which a particular choice of words or phrasing can come across as being a personal attack where none was intended. h. The netiquette described above (a-g) often uses the term &quot;posts&quot;, but applies equally to Private Messages. VI. Baseball Fever User Signature Policy A signature is a piece of text that some members may care to have inserted at the end of ALL of their posts, a little like the closing of a letter. You can set and / or change your signature by editing your profile in the UserCP. Since it is visible on ALL your posts, the following policy must be adhered to: Signature Composition Font size limit: No larger than size 2 (This policy is a size 2) Style: Bold and italics are permissible Character limit: No more than 500 total characters Lines: No more than 4 lines Colors: Most colors are permissible, but those which are hard to discern against the gray background (yellow, white, pale gray) should be avoided Images/Graphics: Allowed, but nothing larger than 20k and Content rules must be followed Signature Content No advertising is permitted Nothing political or religious Nothing obscene, vulgar, defamatory or derogatory Links to personal blogs/websites are permissible - with the webmaster's written consent A Link to your Baseball Fever Blog does not require written consent and is recommended Quotes must be attributed. Non-baseball quotes are permissible as long as they are not religious or political Please adhere to these rules when you create your signature. Failure to do so will result in a request to comply by a moderator. If you do not comply within a reasonable amount of time, the signature will be removed and / or edited by an Administrator. Baseball Fever reserves the right to edit and / or remove any or all of your signature line at any time without contacting the account holder. VII. Appropriate and inappropriate topics for Baseball Fever: Most concisely, the test for whether a post is appropriate for Baseball Fever is: &quot;Does this message discuss our national pastime in an interesting manner?&quot; This post can be direct or indirect: posing a question, asking for assistance, providing raw data or citations, or discussing and constructively critiquing existing posts. In general, a broad interpretation of &quot;baseball related&quot; is used. Baseball Fever is not a promotional environment. Advertising of products, web sites, etc., whether for profit or not-for-profit, is not permitted. At the webmaster's discretion, brief one-time announcements for products or services of legitimate baseball interest and usefulness may be allowed. If advertising is posted to the site it will be copied by a moderator and/or administrator, deleted from the site, then sent to the member who made the post via a Private Message (PM) along with a single warning. Members who choose to not listen and continue advertising will be banned from the site. If the advertising is spam-related, pornography-based, or a &quot;visit-my-site&quot; type post / private message, no warning at all will be provided, and the member will be banned immediately without a warning. It is considered appropriate to post a URL to a page which specifically and directly answers a question posted on the list (for example, it would be permissible to post a link to a page containing home-road splits, even on a site which has advertising or other commercial content; however, it would not be appropriate to post the URL of the main page of the site). The site reserves the right to limit the frequency of such announcements by any individual or group. In keeping with our test for a proper topic, posting to Baseball Fever should be treated as if you truly do care. This includes posting information that is, to the best of your knowledge, complete and accurate at the time you post. Any errors or ambiguities you catch later should be acknowledged and corrected in the thread, since Baseball Fever is sometimes considered to be a valuable reference for research information. VIII. Role of the moderator: When a post is submitted to Baseball Fever, it is forwarded by the server automatically and seen immediately. The moderator may: a. Leave the thread exactly like it was submitted. This is the case 95% of the time. b. Immediately delete the thread as inappropriate for Baseball Fever. Examples include advertising, personal attacks, or spam. This is the case 1% of the time. c. Move the thread. If a member makes a post about the Marlins in the Yankees forum it will be moved to the appropriate forum. This is the case 3% of the time. d. Edit the message due to an inappropriate item. This is the case 1% of the time. There have been new users who will make a wonderful post, then add to their signature line (where your name / handle appears) a tagline that is a pure advertisement. This tagline will be removed, a note will be left in the message so he/she is aware of the edit, and personal contact will be made to the poster telling them what has been edited and what actions need to be taken to prevent further edits. The moderators perform no checks on posts to verify factual or logical accuracy. While he/she may point out gross errors in factual data in replies to the thread, the moderator does not act as an &quot;accuracy&quot; editor. Also moderation is not a vehicle for censorship of individuals and/or opinions, and the moderator's decisions should not be taken personally. IX. Legal aspects of participation in Baseball Fever: By submitting a post to Baseball Fever, you grant Baseball Fever permission to distribute your message to the forum. Other rights pertaining to the post remain with the ORIGINAL author, and you may not redistribute or retransmit any posts by any others, in whole or in part, without the express consent of the original author. The messages appearing on Baseball Fever contain the opinions and views of their respective authors and are not necessarily those of Baseball Fever, or of the Baseball Almanac family of sites.
