Posted: Thursday, November 17, 2011 4:54 pm |  Updated: 4:05 pm, Fri Dec 2, 2011. ‘Bring It On: The Musical' Delivers Humor, Charm and High-Flying Twists by Jeff FavreContributing Writer Los Angeles Downtown News  |  0comments  DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - Making a big budget musical out of a bigscreen property means name recognition. Sometimes this is ablessing, as in the case of The Lion King. Other times, it's anexpensive curse - think Spider-Man . The movie version of Bring It On is hardly a classic,but it spawned a franchise of made-for-TV sequels because itsgoofball teen melodrama mixed with cheering is lightweight,mindless fun. Bring It On: The Musical, which last week came to theAhmanson Theatre with some new songs and libretto rewrites from itsAtlanta premiere, keeps the fun. The show, which continues throughDec. 10 (it's on a national tour), also steps up in weight classthanks to some of the newer Broadway hit-makers, in particular In the Heights creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, Next toNormal composer Tom Kitt, and the book writer for AvenueQ , Jeff Whitty. The creative team, headed by director-choreographer AndyBlankenbuehler, took what works from the 2000 film. On stage arethe sassy teen attitude, cynical adolescent satirical speak andhigh-stance cheerleading routines. Wisely, they threw out therest. Barely straddling the PG-13 line the way Grease does, Bring It On: The Musical handles the challenging task ofcreating a plot and songs that can appeal to teens whileshoehorning enough higher-minded laughs to not neglect the adultswho pay for the tickets. None of the material would work without quadruple-threatperformers (act, sing, dance and cheer). Fortunately,Blankenbuehler nailed it in his casting, in particular with TaylorLouderman, who plays the blonde, perky protagonist Campbell. Campbell, the cheerleading captain of Truman High School, isdestined to lead her squad to a national championship. She isflanked by her bitchy second in command, Skylar (Kate Rockwell),Skylar's ditzy yes-girl Kylar (Janet Krupin), and a newcomer, theimpossibly sweet Campbell wannabe, Eva (Elle McLemore). Campbell's dream takes a left turn soon after a schoolredistricting sends her to the urban Jackson High School, whichinstead of a cheerleading team has a hip-hop crew, led by Danielle(Adrienne Warren). It also includes La Cienega (Gregory Haney), whois transgender. In a fun twist, the other Truman student to be transferred isBridget (Ryann Redmond). Forced to be the Truman mascot because sheis heavier than the typical cheerleader, Bridget is accepted intothe hip-hop crew for her originality, while Campbell must proveherself by wearing Jackson's outdated leprechaun mascot outfit inthe show's funniest number, "Friday Night, Jackson." No one is going to be shocked by the plot twists, but the actualtwists and turns the high-flying actresses deliver earn oohs andaahs. Blankenbuehler has studied the cheer world, and whilefictitious Truman and Jackson won't be winning actual competitions,the staged routines pass the eye test. Louderman looks at home leading cheers, and is equally adept ather vocal duties, hitting the emotional sweet spot on "It's Rightin Front of You." Warren is also up to the challenge, though shekeeps mostly on the ground and accentuates her hip-hop skills. The scene-stealer, though, is Redmond, who is a star in themaking. She possesses impeccable comic timing and a pleasantsinging style. She shines in the morality piece "It Ain't NoThing," which addresses feeling good about yourself. Cross-generational appeal is a challenge, and without theadditions from the nouveau Broadway players, Bring It On would feel forced. Whitty proved his skills with the puppet-powered Avenue Q , and he finds a way to be racy (there's someswearing and sex-related jokes) without crossing over to crude. Atthe same time, his sarcastic, self-conscious style makes fun of theteen genre while still keeping the dialogue authentic. Perhaps areference to the TV show "Hoarders" will be outdated in a fewyears, but it works now. Likewise, Miranda (who co-wrote the lyrics with Amanda Green)proved with In the Heights that he could write impressive,lyrical raps, which come into play during several key songs. It's a movement driven show, so David Korins' set is minimal,highlighted by four hanging projection screens that move around thestage and serve as the backdrop for various locales. They are mosteffective when Campbell has a three-way computer video chat. Maybe Bring It On: The Musical won't be a Broadway hitbecause it's too tightly connected to its silly movie counterpart.However, there's always room in the theatrical landscape for funny,smart and entertaining. Bring It On: The Musical runs through Dec. 10 at theAhmanson Theatre, 135 N.
