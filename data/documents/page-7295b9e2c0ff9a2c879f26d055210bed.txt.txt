What&#8217;s missing? The coupe, of course. After all, the 3-series started out as a two-door in 1975—a four-door wasn&#8217;t offered until 1982, when the second-generation arrived. The wait for the F30-generation 3-series coupe is coming to an end, however. At January&#8217;s Detroit auto show, BMW will unveil a 3-series–based two-door concept, previewing the next-gen 3-series coupe. However, we&#8217;re hearing from European sources that the Bavarians finally will change their nomenclature and call this car the 4-series, although BMW hasn&#8217;t confirmed that. Comparison Test: 2012 BMW 328i vs. 2013 Cadillac ATS Comparison Test: 2012 BMW M3 Coupe vs. 2012 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG Coupe Comparison Test: 2012 BMW 328i vs. 2012 Audi A4 2.0T, 2012 Infiniti G25, 2012 Mercedes-Benz C250 Sport, 2012 Volvo S60 T6 AWD Not only will the 4-series coupe be previewed by the concept, but the next-gen 4-series convertible will take styling cues from the concept, as well. Unsurprisingly, the U.S. market is very important for both variants. Technical details are scarce at the moment, but don&#8217;t expect major changes from the F30 sedan&#8217;s turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four and turbo 3.0-liter straight-six. And as far as the M4—are we the only ones struggling to come to terms with this moniker?—be prepared for a return to six cylinders, albeit boosted. Expect further details on the 4-series concept closer to the start of the 2013 Detroit auto show, which kicks off January 14.
