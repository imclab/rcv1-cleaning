Chicago Rock/pop at Foellinger Theatre, Fort Wayne, 8 p.m. Tuesday, August 27, sold out, 260-427-6715 <br><p class="greyboxbuy"><b>&bullet; Buy Tickets &bullet;</b></p><br></a> Chicago No End to the Numbers By 1985 Chicago had been a constant presence on radio for well over a decade. From their debut album, Chicago Transit Authority , through a succession of numerically named releases, Chicagoâs streak of hit songs seamlessly made the transition from the late 60s to the early 80s without missing a beat. Through those years, despite the strong presence of a powerful horn section, it was bass player Peter Cetera who emerged as the leading vocalist and writer of their very popular ballads. His departure could easily have signaled doom for the band. But in his place arrived Jason Scheff, an equally talented bassist with a voice well-suited to inherit Ceteraâs spot. Only 23 at the time, Scheff had been active in a variety of cover bands in his native state of California, but he knew he wanted more â and then a remarkable twist of fate changed his life forever. âI knew I wanted to get to the next level, so I started writing more songs,â recalls Scheff. âI was working with a publisher who, ironically, went to Warner Brothers to see if my songs could be placed on the Peter Cetera solo album. Warner Brothers heard my demos and said âWait a minute, we need somebody to take Peterâs spot in Chicago.â And thatâs when it happened.â Isnât it a little heady and overwhelming to replace someone like Peter Cetera? Or is 23 just young enough to not know any better? âWell, you nailed it,â says Scheff. âPeople ask me all the time about that, if it wasnât a bit heady and how I was able to handle it all. But I was young and stupid enough to think âWhy not?â If that all happened to me now at 51, and I had been a career Top 40 musician playing in nightclubs and an opportunity like this came to me, I would probably overthink it. But then I just thought âWell, okay!â âI have really adopted the philosophy that you spend the first half of your life trying to be a success and the second half trying to be significant. So now Iâm really focused on giving back to the next generation in the hopes that I can help them the way I was helped.â Scheff credits his bandmates in Chicago with more than just establishing his musical career. He says they helped him set his life on track, as well. âI was your typical kid growing up in the 60s and 70s and got involved in drugs and alcohol. By the time I joined Chicago, those guys had already gone through all of that craziness and had gotten past it. So they really helped me see that I needed to put all of that behind me.â Growing up when he did means he was aware of Chicagoâs music from early in his childhood, and it did influence him as he began his journey as a musician. âI listened to everything, and I heard Chicago, of course, but I wasnât really a big fan until Chicago VI . Actually, my older brother Todd won Chicago VI on the radio, and when I heard it I just fell in love. Then when they made their comeback in the 80s, I was a huge fan of that era and Chicago XVI and Chicago XVII . They really put their stamp on music during that time with those power ballads.â Little did he realize then that one day heâd be responsible for carrying on the legacy of those very songs. Scheff says people often comment that heâs a clone of Cetera and ask if heâs trying to copy him. But Scheff maintains that his experience of covering hits early in his career and his determination to pay homage to the music is behind his ability to so closely replicate Ceteraâs vocals. âPeter and I actually had a conversation about this, and I told him that people thought I was copying him when I was really just trying to honor the music. A lot of people think there must be some competitiveness or weirdness between us, but my visit with him was unbelievable. We were able to talk peer-to-peer, and he was grateful to me for carrying the torch.â As it turns out, Scheffâs connection to Chicago was not his first brush with musical royalty. His father, Jerry Scheff, was himself a bass player and a member of Elvis Presleyâs band for a number of years. Young Scheff got to experience some of that excitement firsthand. âMy parents split up when I was young, and my dad ended up moving to Palm Springs and later to Los Angeles,â says the San Diego native. âI was born in â62, and my dad moved away by the mid-60s, so I would go to school and see all those families, kids with both of their parents, and the one thing I could always hang my hat on was âMy dad plays for Elvis Presley!â âHe took my brother Darin and me to Las Vegas for Elvisâ show once. This was only about three months before he passed away, so it was kind of sad seeing him sick, but it was also really exciting because he had us in the percussion stand. So I can say Iâve been on stage with Elvis.â Scheff credits his parents and all of his family for making his musical success possible, and he credits the remarkable Chicago songbook for making the job such a pleasure for almost three decades. âI do get asked a lot âHow do you keep it fresh?â and I always say, âListen to the material.â Itâs an amazing songbook. Itâs fun to play those songs night after night. I remember when my publisher first hooked me up with Chicago, and I was joining the band, he said, âThis is incredible. You can probably get a good five years out of it!â And now this September it will be 28 years. All of us in the band are so grateful, but every night on stage Walter Parazaider, the sax player who founded the band, and I make eye contact and just feel this great sense of gratitude.â Scheff reports that in addition to their regular schedule of touring, the band also recently shot a scene for the Al Pacino film Imagine and Larry Davidâs Clear History . They also keep recording, planning to put new music on their website with no immediate plans to compile the songs into a new CD. While they did release Chicago XXX in 2005 and have also released a holiday album, for now theyâre content to share their music without any involvement from a label. Having worked with legendary producer Phil Ramone, who passed away in March, Scheff says it becomes more important as they get older to move forward. âIt used to be that if you wanted to record, you had to have a label to release it so you needed permission to record. Thereâs no longer a gatekeeper. We just lost Phil which reminds us that thereâs a sense of urgency to every day. When youâre kids you donât think of things having an expiration date, but we all do. So donât wait for someone to give you a green light. Just get it done.â Michele DeVinney Read More...

Hank 3 Country/punkbilly at Piereâs Entertainment Center, Fort Wayne, 8 p.m. Friday, August 30, $13 adv., $15 d.o.s., 260-486-1979 &bullet; Buy Tickets &bullet; Hank 3 The grandson of Hank Williams Sr., son of Hank Williams Jr. and half-brother of Holly Williams is coming to Piereâs Friday, August 30. Shelton Hank Williams, known as Hank Williams III or Hank 3, is a multi-instrumentalist who plays guitar, bass, drums, banjo and vocals. Ya think he maybe sorta grew up around music much? Williamsâ style alternates between country, punk and metal, and he was the principal member of Assjack (punk/metal), the drummer for Arson Anthem (southern hardcore punk) and the bassist for Superjoint Ritual (Pantera singer Phil Anselmoâs band). He has released seven studio albums, one of which was the first major-label country album ever to bear a parental advisory warning. At Piereâs one can expect a mix of classic country, hellbilly, doom-rock and speed metal with cattle callinâ. Yes, cattle callinâ. Because cattle core is a genre. If youâre in the mood for cowboy hats, whiskey, gritty country and the road-warrior attitude, this may be the show for you. If itâs kid-friendly pop country youâre looking for, Hank just ainât your man. Read More...

Dealâs Gone Bad w/Unlikely Alibi Ska at Foellinger-Freimann Botanical Conservatory, Fort Wayne, 8:30 p.m. Friday, August 30, $6, 12 and under free, 260-427-6440 <br><p class="greyboxbuy"><b>&bullet; Buy Tickets &bullet;</b></p><br></a> Dealâs Gone Bad Dealâs Gone Bad have learned how to make things go right. With their eighth studio recording set for an early fall release, an incredibly tight and energetic lineup and a growing fan base, the ska/reggae/rocksteady revival pioneers from Chicago are gearing up for a major tour next spring. Since 2007âs The Ramblers , Dealâs Gone Bad have honed their sound and style, adding country and rock flavors to their solid Jamaican-inspired chops. Dealâs Gone Bad return to the Botanical Roots Outdoor Concert Series Friday, August 30. Unlikely Alibi open. Topping a record as nearly perfect as The Ramblers is no small or easy task, but, according to drummer Mike Corcoran, the challenge has been good. Corcoran, one of two original members (guitarist Dave Simon is the other) has lived and played through the lineup changes and thinks the new record finds Dealâs Gone Bad in even better form. âAfter The Ramblers we became a tighter band,â Corcoran said. âWe did a world tour to support that record, and all the playing â we did like 180, 200 shows that year â really got us together as a band. We became a live band. The new record shows it. Itâs going to be really fun to listen to.â Thatâs a no-brainer. Dealâs Gone Bad are always fun to listen to. The rhythms are tight, the tunes yank you out of your seat and, with Todd Hembrook on the vocals, the sound transforms you. Hembrook, who for years fronted Fort Wayne ska favorites Skavossas and Heavy Step, started singing with Dealâs Gone Bad after moving to Chicago in the early 2000s. Hembrookâs voice is reminiscent of the singers who defined the Stax Records sound. And heâs got just enough Motown in him to make you think heâs some sort of time traveler. Yet heâs got a style all his own. So does the band. Corcoran had been listening to Fishbone and other bands from the California skateboarding scene, and when he started digging into the music those bands played, he discovered the music coming out of Jamaica in the 50s and 60s. âAt that point I just fell in love with that music,â he said. Dealâs Gone Bad first formed in 1994 when the so-called third wave ska revival was nearing its peak in the United States. The band played so infrequently, however, that Corcoran pegs the beginnings of DGB around 1997, when they began playing more around Chicago. Their first major release Large and in Charge came out that year. Â  Â Â  Constant changes to the lineup, however, prevented the band from refining and defining its sound. More than just a band that simply mimicked the sounds of Jamaican musicians like Prince Buster, The Skatalites and The Wailers, Dealâs Gone Bad were always striving for their own style. When Hembrook joined, they were one heavy step closer to finding it. âOver the years our biggest changes came from lead singer to lead singer,â Corcoran said. âWhat we really wanted to do from the start was Jamaican soul. The Jamaican musicians we admired were all listening to American music. Obviously they had their own culture of music, and that was influenced by R&amp;B. What we wanted to do was add our influences of Chicago blues and funk. The last record we really got the closest to that.â Along with Corcoran, Simon and Hembrook, the band includes Mike âSpiderâ Hobson on bass, Aaron Hammes on sax and vocals, Pedro Hernandez on trombone and Anthony Abbinanti on keyboards. Corcoran said the new album reflects the influences of each songwriter, some bringing a little country, others, rock. But itâs all Dealâs Gone Bad. âWe were trying to find our voice with The Ramblers . Now we have the same singer and the same set of songwriters. We have more confidence on this than on the last record. Weâre able to take different styles and run them through the Dealâs Gone Bad filter. That being said, it gets even weirder. At some point it becomes a challenge to be consistent and yet not repetitive.â The new Dealâs Gone Bad record comes out in November. Prior to that the band will release a new video and another new single. Both should be available before the Botanical Roots show, so thereâs plenty of time to check out the new sounds and get your dancing shoes shined up. Itâs going to be a party.

Matisyahu w/Levi Robin, Djenetic Drift Reggae at Piereâs Entertainment Center, Fort Wayne, 8 p.m. Saturday, August 31, $20 adv., $23 d.o.s., 260-486-1979 &bullet; Buy Tickets &bullet; Matisyahu Exploring the Spirit Through Music Matthew âMatisyahuâ Miller has been having quite the career. He broke out into the public eye in 2005 when the release of his second album, a live record called Live at Stubbâs , became a surprise hit, going Gold in the U.S. and ushering in a new, unique talent in pop music. Here he was, maybe the most unlikely pop star of his time â a fully garbed Hasidic Jew rapper who made poppy reggae tracks that, for some reason, fans of both underground hip-hop and jam band culture seemed to embrace. And, of course, Jewish kids everywhere finally had a Rock God of their own. On paper, it sounded silly. Perhaps Iâm being too honest, but to me it sounded like a stew of gimmickry. I live in a neighborhood known for its Hasidic population, so seeing someone in the full garb (the gartel, the rekel, the beard, the curls, the yamaka, etc.) isnât so odd. But to see a rapper dressed as such in Rolling Stone, on the biggest stages in the U.S., well, that was surprising. Fast forward eight years, and Matisyahu not only has one of musicâs most diverse and devoted followings, but a feature film, four studio records and three live albums. His most recent release, last yearâs Spark Seeker , is arguably his most accomplished work yet, debuting at No. 19 on the U.S. Billboard charts and featuring his most diverse collection of songs to date. The record satisfied fans while also bringing in new ears. When I finally caught up with Matisyahu via a recent phone interview, he didnât much care to talk about Spark Seeker , despite the fact that the record is still going strong and heâs still out on the road supporting the record. âTo be honest, Iâve been recording new music over the last six months, so thatâs where my head has been,â Matis explained as we talked about his upcoming Fort Wayne show. âOn the tour weâre playing a combination of the old records and Spark Seeker tracks. We started off playing a bunch of songs from the new record, and a few really stuck, so we play maybe four of the new songs.â When I asked about the tour, Matis called it a âreggae summer thing,â also featuring Rebelution and Collie Buddz. And while Matis is probably best known as just that â a reggae artist â heâs been covering a whole lot of ground, genre-wise, over the last few years. âIâm doing a lot of different things. Each song [on Spark Seeker ] has a different flavor and appeal to it. Genre-wise, I like a lot of new things, so I work with a lot of different people and do a lot of diverse sounds.â This prompted me next to ask about his artistic motivations. Is the goal to appeal to as many listeners as possible like, say, Katy Perry might be doing with her records? Or is the goal to simply make the music you want to make? Working in so many genres, I have to assume, can feel like a risky approach. You can easily alienate or even deceive fans. That said, Matis has seen friends like Ben Harper do it successfully over the years. âIâve never really created music for a particular audience. It just comes from whatever Iâm into at the moment. I mean, I listen to a lot of different stuff. Lately Iâve been listening to less hip-hop. Iâve mostly been into electro-soul type stuff like Twin Shadow and the Holy Others. The last record I really, really loved was Frank Oceanâs record.â While the diverse sounds of Spark Seeker seemed to sell just fine, further establishing Matisâ cult following, another notable recent change in his artistic image has had an effect on his day-to-day life as a musician and celebrity. As a skateboarding, rapping, singing, guitar-playing, heavily bearded, fully garbed Hasidic Jew, the 6â4â Matisyahu was hard to miss in a crowd, especially when he was outside of Brooklyn. The guy simply stood out. Then, one day, he shaved. All of it. He cut his hair and changed his clothes. Gone was the whole look. Matis now looked like a taller, thinner Adrien Brody, but with salt and pepper stubble, a T-shirt, khakis and a pair of Adidas. He could go out in public and, for the first time since becoming a famous musician, be totally anonymous. Of course, I had to ask about his fansâ reaction to the sudden change. Specifically, I was curious about the reaction he saw from his Jewish fans. âYou know, my Jewish fans are split on it. As an artist you feel misunderstood, but I donât always feel itâs my place to explain myself. The music does the talking. I feel like all the songs Iâve made are authentic representations of where Iâm at, and the next record will be the same. And Iâll talk about all these things on the next record and how they made me feel and where Iâm at with my fans. But to speak on it a little bit, there are those fans who are fans of the music first and foremost. Those fans have been around and stick around, and they totally get it. But there are also the other fans who see it as a betrayal. They think I lost something that I had. âEveryone has [his] own opinion. It still freaks me out to see people saying âwhereâs the beard?â or whatever. But thatâs what we sign up for as public artists. Scrutiny is part of the package.â And while the change in look has certainly been a subject in interviews over the past year or so, very few people have asked Matis about the current state of what seemingly informs his life as an artist the most: his spirituality. Have philosophical ideas changed or were the razors just on sale? âWell, Iâm sort of exploring spirituality right now. I lived with a large set of rules for a lot of years. Sometimes my intuition or feelings line up spiritually, and when they didnât, I tried to force it. So I got to a place where I decided that I wasnât going to force myself to do things that didnât feel right. So itâs more about exploring things on my own rather than with a community. I still look to Judaism for spirituality and for symbology or signs. It enriches my life. I still pray, which is what I was interested in to begin with. A lot of my spirituality beyond Judaism is all about psychology and therapy. Self knowledge and self awareness. Expansion within.â Sounds like an artist, right? Part of the process of finding new creative inspiration involves keeping your mind open to new things â to change and discomfort. To allow yourself to go through things in the most honest, natural way you can, assessing yourself along the way. Is part of the result Matisâ new poppy sound? Who could really say. Certainly, Iâm sure, the wandering has informed his creative output at some level. Eventually our conversation circled back around to just that: the work. The music. Specifically the next record, which Matis seemed to be very excited about, mentioning off and on as we spoke. âWe just pretty much finished recording the new record. Weâre in the process of mixing it while weâre on the road. Iâm really excited about it. Itâs a different direction from the last record. It was produced mainly by my bass player from the Dub Trio, Stu Brooks. And Joel Hamilton. Itâs gonna be cool. Itâs gonna be interesting to see peopleâs reaction to that. So weâre hoping to have that out early next year.â And, to close, I asked Matis to tell me a little bit about his summer. His tour, specifically. âWell, you know, thereâs lots of love on this tour. A really cool group of guys. Really relaxed. Iâve been on tours where a lot of people are pretentious, but everyone on this one is just sort of happy. And weâre playing a real mix of songs this time. Itâs, you know, a real cool show. Laid back.â Mellow, poppy, positive hip-hop-infused reggae music? Sounds like a great way to wind down the summer to me. Greg Locke Read More...

The Black Cadillacs Rock at Dupont Bar & Grill, Fort Wayne, 9:30 p.m. Saturday, August 31, $5, 260-483-1311 <br><p class="greyboxbuy"><b>&bullet; Buy Tickets &bullet;</b></p><br></a> Black Cadillacs The blues-based indie rockers Black Cadillacs return to the Fort the last Saturday of the month. Theyâre easily one of the most popular bands in the Knoxville scene, and Paste Magazine even featured them as one of the â12 Tennessee Bands to Listen to Now.â Each member comes from a different city in Tennessee, and each brings a different flavor to the group while still exemplifying the signature Knoxville sound. The versatility of this group is impressive, as they shift along from subtle country ballads to riffy blues-rock to neo-psychedelic jams; theyâre rock nâ rollers with an accent of authentic Memphis blues and soul. Add to the beautiful blend of instrumentation the poetic lyrics, whistful vocals and charisma of frontman Will Horton, and you have yourself a powerful formula for pleasing audiences. Â  Expect to hear southern blues rock reminiscent of the Black Keys with hints of Pink Floyd, The White Stripes and My Morning Jacket. After a short while thereâll come a moment (okay, many moments) when youâll feel a little urge to tap your feet, nod your head and groove along. Thereâs no use in fighting it. The bandâs dynamic energy is infectious. Â  Read More...

For starters, NBC Sports Network will broadcast the event live August 29-31. Then there are television stars, monster truck and helicopter rides, freestyle motocross action, memorabilia, car corral, swap meet â the list goes on and on. And, oh yeah, there will be cars. Collector cars. Lots and lots of cars. Eleven hundred of them, on-site and on the block. You can see everything from a 1962 Goggomobil TS250 Coupe to a 1933 Ford Hot Rod Highboy Roadster âMexican Blackbirdâ to a 1976 AMC Hornet Station Wagon. As always, the Auburn Fall auction coincides with the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Festival, now in its 57th year. If you like cars, Auburn is the place to be this Labor Day weekend. Keith Koscak of Auctions America in Auburn said the 2013 Auburn Fall will have something for everybody. âWeâve got a lot of great things for the whole family going on this year,â Koscak said. âWeâve got cars in every price category, from $5,000 up to as high as $1.5 million. Cars from a 1907 Ford Runabout to modern sports cars. We even have three Duesenbergs this year, which is pretty special.â Koscak added that one of the main things not to miss are the television stars who will be on hand. And a television network as well. âAlso new this year is the coverage by NBC Sports,â Koscak said. âTheyâre going to do nine hours of coverage that will bring the auction to 80 million homes.â Jessi Combs, star of Discoveryâs Overhaulinâ and All Girls Garage, will be on hand Saturday, August 31 and Sunday, September 1 to sign autographs and meet with fans. And Jessi Combs has a lot of fans. After taking a shot at being a professional snowboarder, Combs decided what she really wanted to do was pursue her love of cars and driving. She enrolled in a specialty school in Wyoming where she learned to build cars from the ground up. Her skill, enthusiasm and personality turned out to be a perfect combination for television. Following a guest co-host stint on Overhaulinâ , she co-hosted Xtreme 4X4 until an accident on the show sidelined her. She was bent in half by some huge contraption and broke her spine. Amazingly she recovered fully and went on to appear on 2 Guys Garage , TruckU , a SEMA Show special, Dupli-ColorTV, Full Throttle TV, Pirate4x4 TV Live , Behind the Scenes with Bosch 125 and Mythbusters . Richard Rawlings and Aaron Kauffman, stars of Discoveryâs Fast Nâ Loud will also be on hand Saturday and Sunday doing pretty much the same thing as Jessi Combs â signing autographs and meeting fans. These guys are a bit, um, scruffier than Combs but have a large fan base nonetheless. Rawlings and Kauffman run a shop called Gas Monkey Garage which is featured on Fast Nâ Loud . Both natives of Texas, the two grew up tearing down cars and putting them back together in ways that made them happy. That usually means the cars, once reassembled, are fast. And loud. Makes sense. Rounding out the TV celebrity appearances is Wayne Carini, the host of Velocityâs Chasing Classic Cars . Carini is the Grand Marshall of the ACD parade which is slated for 1 p.m. Saturday. He is a master of car restoration; heâs restored cars belonging to David Letterman, Ivan Lendl and the DuPont family. Â  Of course, the real reason for all the celebrity appearances, festivities, parades and hoopla is to buy and sell really cool cars, and thereâs going to be a lot of that going on. One of the more anticipated groups of automobiles coming to Auburn is the collection of Ed Ewing. Ewing, a semi-retired business tycoon from Jasper, Indiana, will be auctioning some 100 cars from his personal collection, a collection he houses at Big Tree Farm, his 600-acre estate in Santa Claus. NBC Sports Network will air a half-hour special featuring Ewing and his collection. Called Epic Collections by Auctions America , the special will run at 5:30 p.m. EST Saturday and will be rebroadcast numerous times throughout the weekend. NBC will also cover the auction live. Ewing owns an eclectic collection of cars, including a 1962 Goggomobil TS250 Coupe. The Goggomobil is of German make and is touted as the perfect picnic car. It comes complete with a wicker picnic basket strapped to a rack on the trunk. Â  Ewing also has a 1921 Ford Model T Paddy Wagon. Model Ts came in only one size, but they could be fitted with a number of body styles. Ralph Zajiczek built this Model T as a replica of an East Kittery, Maine police department paddy wagon. Designed as a long-haul workhorse, Zajiczek has driven it from Dallas to the Arctic Circle and back, Dallas to New York and in a cross-country race from New Jersey to Seattle. It comes with a bell, a hand-crank siren and a billy club. Another gem in his collection is a 1935 Auburn 851 Phaeton Sedan, a four-door convertible which is recognized by the Classic Car Club of America as a Full Classic. Another outstanding collection featured this year is that of Kirk F. White. White, according to his website, has been offering âRemarkable Treasuresâ since 1968. âWeâre starting a day early this year as well. The first day will be Wednesday and weâre going to have a preview of the Kirk F. White memorabilia collection. Heâs got some really great stuff.â Not only does Whiteâs collection include incredible cars like his 1933 Ford Hot Rod Highboy Roadster Mexican Blackbird, heâs bringing along a Venus Fashion point-of-sale model, circa 1940 (15â X 28â), a Rubberlite period advertising model made in Chicago. Heâs also got vintage toys, prints, model trains, planes, automobiles, motorcycles and boats as well as a rare pair of German aeronautical 3-D valentines (4 inches by 7 inches by 10 inches). His collection certainly lives up to his tag line. So if youâre looking to spend Labor Day weekend with the family and thinking about starting a car or memorabilia collection of your own, Auburn is the place to be. Mark Hunter Read More...

Rishel Chihuly: Secret Garden & The Summer of Glass Tuesday-Sunday, June 29-Sept. 29, 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Tues.-Sat., 10 a.m.-8 p.m. Thurs.& 12-5 p.m. Sun., Fort Wayne Museum of Art 311 Main St., Fort Wayne Tix: $12-$14,(free to FWMoA members), 260-422-6467 <br><p class="greyboxbuy"><b>&bullet; Buy Tickets &bullet;</b></p><br> The Summer of Glass FWMoAâS Chihuly Summer Part visionary, part glass wizard, Dale Chihulyâs work changed the art of blown glass forever. His colorful pieces and installations, some of the most recognized in the world, appear in more than 200 museums, galleries, concert halls and special exhibits around the globe. But residents of northeast Indiana need not venture far to see them in person. The Fort Wayne Museum of Art opens the legendary glass designerâs exhibition Chihuly: Secret Garden on June 29, 2013. This will be the first time Chihulyâs work has been on public display in our area since 2002, making it a must-see this summer for art aficionados and novices alike. Â  The exhibition was made possible by a unique partnership between the Fort Wayne Museum of Art and the Franklin Park Conservatory out of Columbus, Ohio. The collaboration was formed in part to invite art lovers in our community to see firsthand how the contemporary art form of glass blowing and sculpting has roots in a process that is centuries old. This project is also a landmark effort to bring art previously only accessible in large metropolises to Fort Wayne. The Fort Wayne Museum of Art hopes that by illustrating the artisanal roots of this captivating art form, this exhibition will break down barriers between high art and craft (a divisive issue, particularly when it comes to Chihulyâs work) while also underscoring the relationship of art and craft to daily life, our natural environment and popular culture. For many, Chihulyâs work is the epitome of modern glasswork. It is difficult to imagine the art without his resonating influence. He was a driving force in establishing blown glass as an accepted medium for installation art and contemporary expression. Chihuly made a name for himself by incorporating color and form in a way that creates magical and sometimes larger-than-life sculptures. He has captured the imagination and awe of countless onlookers since he began crafting his pieces in the 1960s. In a time when many glass artists employed complex techniques to mold the material as they desired, Chihuly instead favored a laissez-faire style of patience, allowing the glass to naturally mold itself as it cooled. This meant his pieces required minimal tooling, giving them more of the gravity-influenced forms that characterize his artwork. Coupled with his signature dramatic, vibrant hues, the arms and tentacles of the sculptures almost seem to come to life and grab hold of you. By the 1970s Chihuly was imagining works on a much larger scale, one that required a specialized team, equipment and facility. This team approach to creating artwork was another novel concept he brought to the discipline. Chihulyâs method challenged the idea of the lone artist tucked away in a reclusive studio and paved the way for collaborative pieces and collections from multiple artists. This method of teamwork no doubt influenced the final product as well. Throughout his career, Chihulyâs work has changed dramatically, exploring patterns, line and assemblage technique. Even his trademark use of color, something he acquired over time, is sometimes used sparingly. Chihulyâs interest in sculpture, love of architecture and interpretations of nature are what truly unified his style. What makes the Fort Wayne Museum of Artâs Chihuly: Secret Garden exhibition so unique is the interpretation of the word âgarden.â This enthralling 50-plus piece collection incorporates surprising materials in a dreamlike world very fitting to Chihulyâs style. It showcases some of his most beloved pieces like the famous âMacchia,â âBlue Heron,â âRed Belugaâ and âNeodymium Reedâ series. Guest designer Thomas Cain of Fort Wayne was tapped to help bring this installation to life with other materials not typically found in a museum gallery, making this a one-of-a-kind experience. Â  Chihuly: Secret Garden is one part of the Fort Wayne Museum of Artâs larger, three-show program called The Summer of Glass , featuring more than 160 pieces of glass art. The second installment is the 41st International Studio Glass Invitational , courtesy of Habatat Galleries in Royal Oak, Michigan. This exhibition features 26 award-winning studio glass artists from around the world. The third component is The Next Generation of Studio Glass , an exhibition that explores the influence of Chihuly and other glass luminaries on todayâs emerging studio glass sculptors. All three Summer of Glass shows open to the public June 29 and continue through September 29. The last time a Chihuly exhibit was in town, thousands of people came from across the Midwest to experience it. Fortunately, the Fort Wayne Museum of Art is offering timed entry tickets based on gallery capacity every half-hour to prevent over-crowding. Special tickets at $7 per person are required for these exhibitions in addition to general admission, except for Fort Wayne Museum of Art members (who receive complimentary tickets and general admission). Another bonus of being a member: a members-only preview party will be held the evening of June 28, with a lecture by Ferdinand Hampson, founder and director of Habatat Galleries. A public lecture, scheduled for July 19 at 6:30 p.m., features Bruce Harkey, director of the Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. Admission to the July lecture is $5 for Fort Wayne Museum of Art members and $10 non-members. Ashley Motia Read More...

PRETEND THESE NUMBERS DON'T EXIST. Piere's Staging Their Comeback This year has been one of change for Piereâs Entertainment Center. Often change is a good thing â and certainly in this case it provides an opportunity to update a popular concert and dance club venue â but the reasons for these improvements have been tough to take. The untimely death of Stan Liddell, Piereâs owner and spiritual leader, and a fire which gutted much of that area at Marketplace of Canterbury left the Piereâs family reeling for a bit. But within the framework of tragedy came a time of renewal. Already transitioning to Liddellâs son Herbieâs era at the helm, Piereâs is preparing to relaunch in August with a renewed purpose and a look which brings the facility into the 21st century. âI try to look at it as a blessing in disguise,â says Herbie Liddell. âI had been managing Flashbacks for three years, which was much smaller and allowed me to learn a lot about managing a club, and I came here at the beginning of the year. I wanted to revamp the Zone and Club V to change things up a bit. Then after the fire I thought, âI guess we start now.ââ Liddell promises that almost everything in those two clubs will change, and the suddenness of the fire meant he and the staff had to decide what those changes would be much sooner than anticipated. âWe want Club V to be more urban, Top 40 dance music. Weâre trying to attract a younger crowd, maybe people in their 20s who are looking for something different.â âThe VIP areas are going to change, and the whole layout will be different,â adds Nathan Stephens, Piereâs marketing and entertainment director. âItâs not going to be the same old Club V.â âWe wanted the changes to be dramatic without reinventing the wheel,â says Liddell. âWeâre changing the music, the floor plan, and weâre catering more to the patio area so people can move outside if they want. With smoking no longer legal in the club, we want to have a better area to accommodate those who want to go out for awhile and provide a more comfortable atmosphere for them.â The Zone promises its own unique setting for Piereâs patrons, one which Liddell hopes will bring in a larger demographic, as well. âWe want to cater to women more, given them a place within Piereâs to escape a little. Weâre bringing in brighter colors and giving it a throwback look. The music will have a retro feel. Weâre going for a back-in-the-day feeling in there.â Beyond repairing the two clubs most damaged by the fire, Liddell is also taking the Piereâs main room into a new era. His father had a very particular vision for the building which, when he first purchased it, was a mall area with various small shops. And he had a specific look he was trying to achieve. âMy father liked green, as you can see throughout the building, and weâre giving it some fresh paint,â says the younger Liddell. âAnd thereâs a lot of neon lighting which creates a more 80s and 90s feel and makes it seem more like a bar. I want to give it more of an updated, nightclub look so weâre bringing in LED and intelligent lighting to give the place a more up-to-date look. Really, this building has never had a face-lift, and it really needed one.â âBad,â emphasizes Stephens. While Herbie learned much about managing a club and was brought along gradually by Stan over the years, there are definite differences between the two, and the new Piereâs will definitely reflect that shift. âMy dad was in his 40s and 50s when he was doing this, and Iâm quite a bit younger and have been working in his clubs since I was 18. I started managing Flashbacks in 2010, and the most enjoyable part of that was being able to walk around talking to people, which was much easier to do there since it was so much smaller than Piereâs. As clichÃ© as it sounds, the most enjoyable part of working in a club is watching people have a good time, making sure that people have a good time. If they have fun, then theyâll want to come back.â Part of the reopening, which will feature no cover charge and drink specials to entice the crowds, is to lure people back who may have stopped coming to Piereâs over the years. Once a hot spot for both concerts and for weekend dance clubbing, Piereâs had been slowly developing a reputation for some trouble, something Liddell is anxious to change. âItâs had a less than positive image in recent years, and I really want to turn that around. When I was at Flashbacks, I would talk to customers, and they would say that they didnât go to Piereâs anymore, so I would ask them why. And it was because they heard things, and the reputation wasnât very good. So we want to make it clear that we have a zero tolerance policy on smoking, for one, because it isnât legal to smoke in the club anymore. âAnd we have no tolerance for violence of any kind. Iâve talked to the Fort Wayne Police Department, and I talk to my security guards and tell them that they have to catch any weapons that might be coming into the building. I test them, too, sending people through with small, plastic weapons to see if they catch them. If they donât, then theyâre fired. I just canât have that going on in Piereâs anymore. We want it to be not just fun but safe here.â The staff at Piereâs is also anxious to promote a good reputation to bands who might play on their stage. A recent Marilyn Manson concert sold out quickly, and beyond that success Manson, who is a reputed diva when it comes to accommodating his needs at performances, was happy with his treatment at Piereâs, something which they hope gets around to other bands who might want to play there in the future. Although it hasnât been an easy time for the staff, and particularly for Herbie Liddell who is tackling a major project at Piereâs without his fatherâs guidance for the first time, there is great excitement about the future of the entertainment center. âWe want this to be âtheâ spot whether you live here or out of town. We want people to come from miles around to visit us.â Michele DeVinney Read More...

Decautur Sculpture Tour Daily thru May 31, 2014 2nd Street, Decatur free, 260-724-2604 <br><p class="greyboxbuy"><b>&bullet; Buy Tickets &bullet;</b><br> </p> Decautur Sculpture Tour Small Town Shows Off Big Art A drive through Decatur may seem like a pass through any other small Indiana town, but if you look closely you will notice the downtown area is speckled with pieces of art. The sculptures that stand along 2nd Street have welcomed visitors to the area for a full year. On June 7 they will be removed and replaced by a new crop of creative work. The following day Decatur will host a public art event, the Decatur Sculpture Tour, a name which reflects the expansion of the sculpturesâ footprint beyond the cityâs immediate downtown area. Â  Fifteen sculptures from nine artists will be celebrated with small town merriment. The tour officially begins June 8 with accompanying music, food, sculpture tours and a childrenâs chalk walk. The 2013 sculpture locations will line over two blocks of historic 2nd Street, with additional exhibits on Monroe Street. Visitors unfamiliar with the area can stop by any shop sponsoring a sculpture to pick up a map that includes a ballot for the Peopleâs Choice Award. Winners will be announced in early October. Artists involved in this yearâs project hail from Indiana, Ohio and Missouri. Many of the sculptors are repeat participants, but the Sculpture Committee is happy to welcome two new artists to the mix. The concept for the Sculpture Tour was inspired by the work of local artist Greg Mendez when he produced a commissioned piece for the Adams Public Library. The work, âIt Must Be a Good Book,â was well received by the community and sparked enthusiasm for public art in Decatur. Mendez teamed with local leaders to organize the 2012 Decatur Sculpture Walk with intention to inspire, soothe, provoke, connect and involve the public through art. Last year eight outdoor and four indoor sculptures were displayed. Diane Macklin, who operates Sunshine Uniques Flowers and Gifts, sponsored a sculpture last year by artist Jesse Wolf and is excited to see what the Sculpture Tour will bring to town this year. âIt is amazing what people around here can do,â said Macklin.
