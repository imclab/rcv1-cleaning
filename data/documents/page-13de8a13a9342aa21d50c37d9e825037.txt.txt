Study Says No Â  NBC&#39;s &#39;Today&#39; show recently suggested that claims from the manufacturers of baby media products may be overblown, and now a new study published in Psychological Science presents empirical evidence that infants who watched an unidentified baby video did not actually learn the words that the video purported to teach. The researchers, led by Judy S. DeLoache of the University of Virginia, recruited 96 families with children between 12 and 18 months of age to participate in a month-long study. Some children watched a best-selling infant-learning DVD several times a week, half of them watching alone and half with a parent. Another group had no exposure to the DVD, but their parents were asked to try to teach them the words from the DVD in everyday interactions. Before and after the month of vocabulary work, all of the children were tested on their knowledge of a list of words that appeared in the DVD. The results were clear: Those infants who regularly watched the DVD over four weeks learned very little from their exposure to it, regardless of whether they had watched alone or with a parent. They knew no more of the words from the DVD than did children who had never seen it. This aligns with DeLoache&#39;s earlier research showing that very young children often don&#39;t understand symbols that are perfectly obvious to adults. Infants who watch DVDs like the one used in this research may not relate the images on the screen to reality. 2010 http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/206553.php BUILD Reading SKILLS Â  Â  Youtube Video&#39;s to look at - read and listen to.
