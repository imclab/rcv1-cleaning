The decals were made at the Miramar sign shop where Garcia works.  &mdash; David Brooks / Union-Tribune  Teo Garcia wore black pants and a black shirt to his father’s funeral. He figured that’s just what people do in the grip of a loss so great. Things had been rocky between them at times, but still the son grieved. Wearing black was one way to show it. Sticking a decal on his car was another. Four years after his father’s death, Garcia keeps a large decal on the rear window of his Chevy Malibu that reads: “Teodoro Garcia Sr., 5/25/52-12/21/06, ‘Peace Be With You Pops.’ ” He handed out dozens of similar stickers to family and friends at the funeral. Garcia, who made the decals while working at a Miramar sign shop, said the rolling memorial “helps me remember the good things about him, the good times. I need that.” Southern Californians have always had deep relationships with their vehicles. The four-wheeled contraptions aren’t just a way to get from Point A to Point B. For many, the car is a toy, sanctuary or way to announce to the world that “this is who we are.” So perhaps it’s not strange that sedans, SUVs and pickups also have become forums for displaying sadness, for showing familial bonds, for paying tribute to the departed. “To the extent that cars are a central part of our life, it makes sense,” said Nicholas Christenfeld, a professor of psychology at the University of California San Diego. “Cars are now just mobile living rooms, family rooms, kitchens … and the symbols of mourning that one might have confined to one’s house can now be displayed on one’s car.” Owners of sign and automotive custom shops in San Diego County said the sale of personalized memorial decals has become a steady part of their business. Janel Eaton, owner of Decalifornia Designs in Escondido, said customers began asking for the decals about six years ago. Now she gets online orders for 20 to 40 of them at a time, at $6.99 to $10.95 each. Custom Decals of El Cajon receives orders for several hundred at a time, often from people who have lost a friend or loved one in a vehicle accident. The shop caters to the region’s sizable off-roading community and donates many stickers. Manager Joel Miner said the decals help keep life in perspective, impressing on motorists and off-roaders that “it’s not all just fun and games.” “I definitely see a lot of them around,” he said. “They are more common than you’d like to see.” Victor Lopez of San Diego, whose father died last fall, spent $25 last week on 10 decals made by Modern Image Signworks in Miramar, where Garcia, 31, is a production manager. Each decal includes his father’s name, Oscar Lopez, the dates of his birth and death and a symbol of his favorite sports team — a blue-and-gold Chargers bolt. “He was a die-hard Charger fan,” his son said. Oscar Lopez — father of four and nighttime stock clerk at a grocery store — died during a family gathering in November after a sudden brain aneurysm. He was 63.
