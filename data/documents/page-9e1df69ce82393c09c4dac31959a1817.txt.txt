Brady Bunch was one of the most popular shows of absolutely all time. It was a show about the funniest average funny of all time. The theme song really explains it all.

Dance Dance... Where do I get started.....Lots of disco and grove. Women were so into dancing that when they went out dancing they wore pants and wouldn't wear their mini skirts. Couples would also go out disco dancing doing stuff like... of course the bump. I mean who doesn't know that dance. all you do is bump your buts together. In the 1970s they made up a lot of their own silly dance moves. Some may still be around today and probably funnier than ever. They are totally fun to do. If you look below you will discover a list of some of these fabulous dances. and you can also watch some very funky dance videos too. -Walk Like An Egyptian -The hustle -Funky Chicken -Disco -The bump -The YMCA -Robot -The Shake Literature Lots of poetry being written in the 70's, but not many plays. There were some novels too. One of the most popular authors to present themselves and write was Toni Morrison who wrote about being her kind. She had plenty of readers. Another famous writer was Rod McKuen. He was a poet and his work was immensely famous in the 1970's. In the writing world, there were many books published in the 1970s. Like I said in many places on this website, there are much more than the examples I show you, but it would be years to find every single book published. In 1970 or 1969, "Slaughterhouse 5" was made by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., and it was about a man abducted by aliens. In 1970, the fantasy book "The Crystal Cave" by Mary Stewart was created, as well as the mystery novel "The Secret Woman" by Victoria Holt. In 1971, the book "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight" was made by Jimmy Breslin. In 1977, "Love Story", a book about lovers that are completely opposite was made by Erich Segal. Some very famous or some of the best poets ever were Bruce Andrews, Rae Armantrout, Nicole Brossard, Clark Coolidge, Jayne Cortez , Ann Lauterbach , Bernadette Mayer, Tom Raworth and Fred Wah. Poetry of the 70's was a weird style. Most was not light, fluffy or funny, but most of it was not dark or eerie either. In the poetry world, there was so many pieces of poetry in the 70s, and that is expected in a generation of peace and dance. I will show a few examples of what poetry is out there, but there is a bunch more, like I keep repeating (sorry if I am annoying you with repeating what I say).There were many poems, and here are a few. There is "Gather Together in My Name" by Maya Angelou, "A Poet's Alphabet" by Louise Bogan, "Margins" by Phillip Booth, "The Double Dream Of Spring" by John Ashbery, "Madness" by James Dikory, and "Earth Walk" by William Meredith. Notice how the majority of the poems are peaceful or explain feelings, kind of the theme of the 70s. Humor Everything was funny in those days. But jokes were finally getting complicated and they even had Your Mama jokes which people still use today. This is a great site with all of the best jokes of the 1970's-http://www.top20fun.com/funny_jokes/968.html Humor was in the groove!!! In the 1970's, humor is very important. It can be as complex as a movie, or as simple as a comic strip. In whatever form it is in, there are many forms of it, and I chose a few to show to you. Have you ever heard of "Cheech and Chong"? Well, they are three comedians that record their voice and make jokes in lifestyle. One of their popular recordings is "Sister Mary Elephant", featuring a teacher screaming at the class to "SHUT UUUPP!!!". Another person who talks humor is Steve Martin, a standing comic. He tells jokes on the stage, and is still alive today, and has recently been in "The Pink Panther". Movies are also a good form of humor. In 1976, the classic disney movie "Alice in Wonderland" came out, and also "Freaky Friday", the original movie of the popular one made in 2003. In 1974, "Young Frankenstien", a parody of the original Frankenstien came out. In 1970, a disney classic, "The Aristocrats" came out. In 1973, yet another animated disney film came out, called "Robin Hood", and finally, in 1979, the classic horror movie "Dracula came out. Architecture Architecture wasn't anything special in the 1970's really. But things were becoming more modernized and houses became a lot more personalized. People also realized and renewed the love of historical architecture and brought a little bit of that classic style back. The Sears tower was the star building of the 70's and became the tallest building in the world. Several architects came together to build it and it was finished in 1973. People in the 70's started to experiment with different materials and styles such as glass, and steel construction, but also open spaces. Create a free website with Weebly
