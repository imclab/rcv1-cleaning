The issue will be out next week! She&#8217;s gearing up for the season premiere of ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Revenge&#8221; and during promotions, Emily VanCamp scored the cover spot on NYLON magazine&#8217;s September 2013 issue. While rocking a few poses in designer duds from Heather Bell and Topshop for the Jason Nocito-shot spread, the 27-year-old actress dished about her successful series and reveals her constant struggles with the pesky paparazzi. On &#8220;Revenge&#8221;: &#8220;They could&#8217;ve hired someone with a bigger name and banked on that. They took a chance on me, and it&#8217;s brought on a whole new collection of opportunities.&#8221; On being chased by the shutterbugs : &#8220;It should be illegal for people to stalk you with the cameras. It&#8217;s really invasive. How do you enjoy a moment? I see how people spiral out of control.&#8221; On her &#8220;girl next door&#8221; reputation: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have labeled myself that way. I just think I had the look to play those characters. I was a good kid, but I definitely had my moms of rebellion.&#8221; Share Related Posts: December 2, 2012 -- Emily VanCamp Attends Mending Kids International Celebrity Poker Tournament January 26, 2013 -- Jeremy Renner: “Hansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters” Premiere August 25, 2013 -- Emily VanCamp Attends Nylon September Issue Party Zemanta Category: Celebrity News &middot; Tags: Emily VanCamp Pages (1,681) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ... » Last » Welcome Welcome to The Fan Sites Network's Updates, News and Gossip blog.
