'The Simpsons' creator Matt Groening honored by Writer's Guild By Olu Alemoru, Staff Writer Los Angeles Wave  |  0comments  Matt Groening, the creator of the "The Simpsons" and "Futurama," has been honored by the Writer's Guild of America for his contributions to animation writing and his efforts to organize his fellow creators in the industry. On Wednesday night, Groening received the WGA's West Animation Writers Caucus' (AWC) 15th Annual Animation Award, recognizing his contributions to the craft of writing, as well as his assistance in organizing primetime animation with the guild. The award was presented at the AWC's annual meeting, reception and awards ceremony, held at the WGA headquarters in the Fairfax District. He was presented the award by "Futurama" co-developer David X. Cohen. "From a world with no animation on during primetime, who could have guessed that 'The Simpsons' would become the longest-running scripted primetime series in history. Matt definitely deserves this," said AWC Chair Craig Miller. Meanwhile, "Simpsons" writer Mike Scully paid tribute to his union work. "Without the support of Matt Groening and Gracie Films [which produces the show], primetime animation writers might not have succeeded in getting their shows covered by the WGA, which allowed them to receive equal compensation and benefits with their live action counterparts."
