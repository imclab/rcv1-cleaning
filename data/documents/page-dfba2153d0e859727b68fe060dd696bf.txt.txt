Beyonce Releases Proof She Was Really Pregnant: “Life Is But A Dream” [Video] Rihanna Receives Backlash From Fans At Belgium Show Arrives Hours Late 08-06-13 Posted by JadaE | Filed Under: Gossip Well it looks like Rihanna&#8217;s partying ways are catching up with her. The singer was set to perform in Belgium, but arrived two hours late to already disappointed fans. But it did not stop there. According to music critic,Sasha Van Der Speeten, Rihanna was visibly lip-syncing carelessly, saying: There was a wall of reinforced concrete between Rihanna and the public at Sportpaleis. The pop icon played almost two hours on autopilot. … It had the effect of a Valium overdose. She goes on to say that RiRi was very careless and &#8216;shameless&#8217;, along with tweets from fans at the show saying that the popstar was visibly under the influence. Get your life, Ri! I love Rihanna, I liker her style. She is always the blueprint for a lot of fashion trends and hot outfits, but I would never spend money on tickets to see her live. No way! Hopefully she pulls her act together for her next show in Paris this week and separates partying from work.
