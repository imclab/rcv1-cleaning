Plan in Works to Bring Eight-Screen Movie House to Historic Core  10comments  DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES — The Regal cineplex at L.A. Live and the Downtown Independent could have some competition in a few years: A plan is in the works to bring an eight-screen movie house to the Historic Core. Saeed Farkhondehpour , developer of the Medallion project that opened in 2010 at Fourth and Main streets, said that the Texas-based Alamo Drafthouse chain has signed a letter of intent to open an eight-screen theater at the site. Farkhondehpour said he expects a lease to be signed this month. A 30,000-square-foot single-story building would go up on a parking lot that sits atop a hill that rises from the commercial plaza of the 96-unit apartment complex. The site currently houses a 300-space parking lot. Plans call for the theater to be built into the hill with a rooftop garden. Some parking on the lot would remain. If all goes according to plan, Farkhondehpour expects the theater to open in about 18 months. The Alamo Drafthouse is an Austin, Texas small theater chain that holds special events like themed movie nights, which can include things like a night of slasher movies or independent films.   Filmmakers are also often invited to talk about their movies before a screening and the theater lets people order food and beer  from their seats.   Alamo Drafthouse has theaters in states like Texas, Missouri, Colorado and Virginia. A San Francisco location is set to open late this year. The Downtown theater would be the company’s first Los Angeles location.   ©Los Angeles Downtown News.

Let me help you......according to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Skid Row's borders are from 3rd street to the north, 7th street to the south, MAIN street to the west and Alameda street to the east. In other words, this project will exist IN Skid Row, NOT the Historic Core, NOT next to Skid Row, nor near Skid Row.....directly IN our 50-block community. Hope that helps :-) Link Robert posted at 9:04 am on Thu, Apr 11, 2013. Posts: 23 I'd also love to have the beautiful existing theaters open more regularly. Many of these theaters are simply stunning. But if you've got only one screen, how profitable can it be? You'd be relegated to single showings or very short runs. A multiplex is better for the neighborhood in terms of providing a service that people will want to use regularly and provide continuous vitality to the area.

Imagine The State/Los Angeles/The Palace/Orpheum,The Tower/The Million Dollar and The United Artist all having film theme movies. If these palaces are to larger then we have The Roxy/Arcade and the Cameo that are ideal for smaller audiences. Link Juanito Crandello posted at 10:17 pm on Wed, Apr 10, 2013. Posts: 50 Sue Laris: you know about the connection to the 1863 battle. So write about it already! Link Juanito Crandello posted at 10:15 pm on Wed, Apr 10, 2013. Posts: 50 Moreover, the new movie complex will stand a few steps away from the site of the 1887 Cyclorama of The Battle of Paris. This was likely the largest such cyclorama ever constructed, featured various painted scenes of the battle prepared by the staff of french studio artist Felix Phillipoteau who all together had painted the large canvas image of the Battle of Gettysburg featured at a smaller cyclorama in Boston. Spectators sat on chairs on an elevated turn table, were slowly spun 360 degrees while music played - an actualization of sorts of Edweard Muybridge's filmic deck of cards. If one knows the history of film, they know of that deck of cards. So much having to do with the history of cinema having happened in such close proximity to Third and Main in what became the film capital of the world should not be ignored. In addition this all of this, the city's astounding connection to the Battle of Gettysburg resides at the triangle at the southeast corner of Third and Main. The 150th anniversary of that Battle is rapidly approaching - will occur on July 1st thru 3rd this summer. Link Juanito Crandello posted at 9:58 pm on Wed, Apr 10, 2013. Posts: 50 And across on the other side of Third Street stands the remains of the 1910 Wonderland Theater, the first theater constructed in the west expressly for cinema. And north of that once stood a two story building constructed in 1901 and the center storefront on the ground floor was leased to Thomas L. Tally who used the space as 'The Electric Theater', the first commercial cinema in the western U.S. Some historicans have cited this cinema as having been the world's first. NOPE. L.A. was way behind Buffalo in this respect and the U.S. was way behind Paris, Berlin and London. Link Troy Dalmasso posted at 7:26 pm on Wed, Apr 10, 2013. Posts: 1 This is so awesome! I just moved here after almost 20 years in Austin, Alamo Drafthouse is on my short list of what I miss most. Link Dex Nomadico posted at 4:00 pm on Wed, Apr 10, 2013. Posts: 1 Great news and a great counterpoint to the Regal cinemas. I doubt the frat crowd will be hanging out here and if they do, they'll get kicked out for texting. yay.

Posts: 23 This is seriously awesome news, as long as the theater is planning on showing independent and foreign films. Right now you have to go to Pasadena or the west side for these.
