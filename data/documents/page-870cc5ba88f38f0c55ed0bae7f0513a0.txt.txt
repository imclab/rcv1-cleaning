Palm Theatre.

Along the way their adventures veer into fantastical as it becomes impossible to tell which demons are real and which are the product of Don Quixote&rsquo;s imagination. The play lends itself well to the Mudd Butt Mystery Theatre Troupe, which is known for its whimsical storylines and out-sized, colorful props. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about imagination and folk heroes and the kids love it,&rdquo; said co-director Kim Epifano. &ldquo;I think a lot of times children are told to not go with your imagination: &lsquo;Just sit still over there.&rsquo; And in this play, it really lets them see the other side of that. Does somebody have an imagination or was somebody being crazy?&rdquo; A strobe light illuminates various battle scenes that see Don Quixote, clad in armor, fighting wine barrels, muleteers, spice traders and, most famously, windmills he believes to be ferocious giants. And what would an epic adventure tale be without a love story? The play also chronicles Don Quixote&rsquo;s love for a peasant girl he reinvents as princess &ldquo;Dulcinea.&rdquo; Co-directors Epifano and Sally Davis are returning to Mudd Butts for their 27th season this year. The Telluride Academy summer staple puts kids through a month-long program that teaches them dance, acting, set design and more. Kids&rsquo; ideas are respected and their interpretations become part of the process, Epifano said. &ldquo;We give them a safe bubble where they can explore who they are creatively and who they are emotionally,&rdquo; Davis said. &ldquo;We are artists, but we are educators, and we really believe in that. We honor each person&rsquo;s skills and beauty and specialness.&rdquo; Like always the show&rsquo;s props &mdash; large artistic paper mache creations by prop master Mike Stasiuk &mdash; will be up for sale to the highest bidder at a fundraising auction after Saturday&rsquo;s final performance. This year, audience members can be the owners of horses, glittering armor, marionettes, giant books, donkeys, loaves of bread and colorful dragons. After 23 years with Mudd Butts, Stasiuk&rsquo;s creations have likely made their way to all corners of the globe. &ldquo;Mike&rsquo;s props are all over the world at this point,&rdquo; Davis said. Although the organizers live in far-flung locales &mdash; Stasiuk in New Hampshire, Epifano in Oakland and Davis in Telluride &mdash; the three reunite each summer in the box canyon to lend their creative expertise to the production. Mudd Butts has become a family of sorts. &ldquo;It may not be a polished, polished show, but there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of spirit in it because these kids have bonded,&rdquo; Davis said. &ldquo;And with us too. We have all been on this ride together and in a way I&rsquo;m more interested in that. We are definitely going to work our tails off until the lights come up &hellip; but there&rsquo;s something bigger we are after.&rdquo;  Historic survey update moving forward Public art pioneer Christo to speak in Telluride Article Rating Current Rating: 0 of 0 votes!
