                            Book review (fiction): The Cuckoo’s Calling  
                         
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Full disclosure: I never would have guessed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                            Book review (fiction): The Highway  
                         
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “The Highway” is the summer’s most terrifying novel. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                            Book review (nonfiction) Cities Are Good for You  
                         
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Leo Hollis should have had me at the title. His book “Cities Are Good for You: The Genius of the Metropolis” seeks to articulate something I take as an article of faith: Cities are the only place to live. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                            Book review (fiction): The Interestings  
                         
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Novels tend to fall into two camps: incident-driven (a dead body shows up in chapter one, and the novel solves the mystery and explores the ramifications) or character-driven (real-life people experience everyday life). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                            Book review (mysteries): How the Light Gets In; A Question of Honor; A Spider in the Cup; Murder, She Rode
                         
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Can the kindness of strangers mitigate the Holocaust? Of course not. Can the good works of a charity trump a carjacking? Certainly.
