 "All I wanted was a little rose tattoo..." by William Eric McFadden revision 01052012-1420 Links to sites not related to humor or entertainment can be found in my Bookmarks . Read my disclaimer .

The Oatmeal David Thorne's 27b/6 Dave Barry at The Miami Herald--new URL The Onion Weekly World News The Borowitz Report Cartoons, Cartoonists, and Illustrators (should this go in Pulchritude ? Or Art ?) "(Mandy is) a bit of a cliché, no doubt about it; but cartoonists deal with instantly recognizable types all the time. The secret is to twist that cliché enough so that it seems fresh. So heregoes: Mandy is a gorgeous, sexy young woman who is not aware of how she affects people--shes basically an innocent. She does not dress glamorously, or in an attempt to be sexy, but whatever she puts on just comes out that way. The proverbial potato sack would look like one of Victorias best-kept Secrets if she put it on. She is guileless, not to say clueless--she isnt the stereotypical dumb blonde, she just has no agenda, no wish to deal with anyone except in a straightforward, honest manner. Unfortunately, she assumes that everyone else feels the same way, and its not often the case. And this can get her into trouble from time to time. Nevertheless, she shrugs off disappointments and goes on with her naiveté andoptimism intact. Shes also remarkably clumsy; but she manages to pull that off as a sort of grace. She may look silly, but she never looks bad . She loves the outdoors, and animals. In fact, shes sort of a modern day nymph, although with clothes (usually...well, often. Okay, sometimes)."--Dean Yeagle at Bellefree DeanYeagle.com & CagedBeagle.com official sites Gallery at bellefree.com (new URL) Gallery at ComicArtFans.com Gallery at ComicArtCommunity.com Gallery at Pin Up and Cartoon Girls Gallery at Artful Drawings ; with daily-updated captioned drawing Gallery at ArtGlaz.com Gallery at ModelMayhem Portfolio at portfolios.com (gone?) interview at Naked Tunes interview at AnimatorsUnite.com "(Mandy is) not a model of any kind (note how she always seems surprised at being in a picture). She would be terribly embarrassed at being actually pictured in Playboy...yet she does pose, nude, for local art classes. For Art's sake. And she has a number of jobs that allow for flexible hours - roller-skating car hop at a retro diner, dog-walker, bicycle messenger, soaper at the car wash, etc., so that she can continue her studies with the oboe, sculpture, and Medieval French poetry."--Dean Yeagle at Bellefree Dozens of desktop wallpapers featuring Mandy can be found on William McFadden's Wallpapers: the Girls of Dean Yeagle page.
