Read More &gt;&gt; Randal W S.  Marionville, MO  When the car failed, On-Star it towed it to dealer. We picked up our vehicle a couple days later, and within approximately 100 miles, we had the same failure. We called dealer, dealer sent out his tow truck with a temporary replacement vehicle. We switched vehicles, and they took the car to re-repair it in their shop. When the vehicle was finished, we returned their car and picked up our car. It is now running very good. We are very satisfied. Mayse Automotive Group did a good job. Dennis E. Villwok Read More &gt;&gt; Dennis E V.  Galena, MO  Brought in a 2011 Silverado certified for service.

Bull Shoals, AR  Hello, my name is Dalia I purchase a new 2013 Chevrolet Mailibu. I really like the car, handles great, very comfortable seats, plenty of room in the back seat, but I don't like the plastic wood in the interior makes the car look cheap and I don't like the fact that GM is no longer suppling a spare tire. I did enjoy the experience at Mayse J.R.(Professional Sales Consultant) is friendly, understanding, patient, and easy to talk to. Jeff (Business Manager) made the paperwork process fun and easy to understand. I will definitely to go back for my third car. Read More &gt;&gt; Dalia J.
