This week&rsquo;s featured artist is Madison&rsquo;s own Larry Ross, a self-described&ldquo;humorous illustrator&rdquo; with many years of experience working in editorial, books, and advertising.He enjoys working with a variety of clients, managing to bring warmth, humor and style to their ideas with his natural ability to create unique concepts based on articles, ads or manuscripts. Ross originally began drawing humorous pictures while growing up in Pennsylvania and went on to attend Pratt Institute, where he earned a BFA.After graduation he began his professional artistic career while living in Brooklyn, or as he calls it, &ldquo;The Funny Borough&rdquo; which was the perfect location for this humorist--close enough to Manhattan to find some serious clients. These days, the computer has joined his pad, pencil, pen and ink, as tools of the trade. Ross&#39; work has been chosen for The Society of Illustrator&#39;s Annual Show and The Best of The New York Times as well as winning awards at The New York Art Director&#39;s Club and The New Jersey Art Director&#39;s Club.In addition, over the years, Ross has illustrated more than 20 children&#39;s books, numerous humor books for adults and award winning book covers for all ages, and he has created  original artwork for The New York Times,  New York Magazine, Harper&#39;s Magazine and  The National Lampoon.Larry has also illustrated ads and created advertising campaigns for IBM, Perdue Chicken, AlkaSeltzer, USA Network,  CBS, Master Card, and Newsweek to name a few. Ross and his wife Nancyhave two sons and have called Madison home for many years. Ross was one of the first artists chosen to be part of the Banner Art Project, and he considers it &ldquo;an honor to be included in the Madison Arts Sidewalk Gallery. I&rsquo;m glad I could contribute and be part of this excellent project, which adds an element of beauty and surprise to the already very lively and interesting downtown area.&rdquo; His banner can be found on Waverly Place. The Madison Arts &amp; Culture Alliance is a local non-profit arts and cultural organization.Guided by its Strategic Plan, MACA focuses on enhancing communication with individual members, member organizations and the general public as well as strengthening the relationship with our local government officials and schools.MACA explores new initiatives to advocate the central role of arts and culture in everyday life by engaging key participants to help create an integrated arts community.The leadership of MACA believe that fostering collaboration with and among all the people and organizations in the creative ecosystem is the highest priority of the Madison Arts &amp; Culture Alliance.
