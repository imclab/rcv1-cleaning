Richmond International Film Festival 2013: Movies, Panels and More! Cristina Merrill Richmond.com Check out international films, short flicks and Q &amp; A panels at the Byrd all weekend long with the Richmond International Film Festival. An old man determined to have some fun. A young woman trying to get her divorced parents back together. A hallucinating musician. An interpretation of the biblical story of Cain and Abel. This is just a sliver of what the Richmond International Film Festival is bringing to the River City this year. The event features films from Virginia and around the world. There will be screenings of short and feature films, Q-and-A panels with filmmakers, and more. The festival is an expansion of last year’s MIX International Short Film Awards. Now the movie fest includes feature-length films. Film lengths range from as short as 4 minutes to nearly 2 hours. “I’m particularly excited about bringing groups of folks together from around the city, whether to enjoy a couple of days of great film, mix and mingle with notable guests, or for our local businesses, cast and crew to network and show off the talent we have right here in Virginia,” RIFF founder and director Heather Waters said in a statement. The event will run from Feb. 28 to March 3 and will take place at Carytown’s Byrd Theatre , located at 2908 West Cary Street. The Virginia Historical Society and The Camel will also host festival-related activities during the four-day period. Cinephiles have plenty of viewing options. Tickets for individual screenings are $9, plus fees. (Most individual screening timeslots will show more than one film.) A festival pass can be purchased for $150, plus fees. There are also double screening and multi-screening ticket purchasing deals. Ten of the 53 films being screened came out of Virginia, according to Waters. One film that came out of Richmond is “ Cain ,” created by Virginia Commonwealth University alumnus John Cappello. The silent film, which was his senior thesis, explores the biblical story of Cain and Abel.  Cappello, 22, admitted it was a “daunting production,” and said there were costume issues and location scouting difficulties, among other obstacles. “We thought when we were going out that our biggest problem was going to be running into rattlesnakes,” Cappello said. “Didn’t see a single rattlesnake. We ran into a million other problems.” Cappello is hoping festival attendees will check out “Cain” and appreciate all the hard work that went into making it. “And maybe introduce themselves to me and have a nice conversation,” he said. Another film that came out of Richmond, and also from VCU students, is “ Golden Acres .” This 15-minute film is about an elderly man who is upset when his son abandons him on his birthday. “Sick of being forgotten and treated like a decrepit old man, he and his dementia-stricken companion, Chefsy, burst out of their retirement home for a night on the town,” a film synopsis reads. Another Richmond film is “Speak Now,” about a young woman who comes home for her sister’s wedding and intends to get her divorced parents back together. The majority of the people involved in the film are from the Richmond area, and director Calvin Jamison, who grew up in Richmond, credits his involvement with the city’s film community growing up as being “very, very important to my development as an artist.”  Los Angeles-based director A. David McKay , who lived in Richmond for six years and premiered his film “Red Sheep” at last year’s festival, will show his film “ Johnny ” this year. In the 9-minute film, the title character, a musician, has a mind-boggling experience. “He ends up in a bar where he loses his head and begins a hallucination-filled performance where his small audience is in danger,” McKay explained in an email. “Then he’s off to the next place where we hope to pick up on the next film.” McKay is hoping to get as much exposure as possible from being in the RIFF.  “It’s a great local festival for a great little filmmaking community and a big indie film fan base,” McKay wrote in an email. “It’s also one hell of a party.” Cristina Merrill is totally digging Richmond’s art scene.
