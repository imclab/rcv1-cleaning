This fall classic brings artists and holiday shoppers together for one of the first chances to see this season's new art work. One-of-a-kind work from 100 artists from around the country will be on display between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. each day. The Naples Fall Fine Art &amp; Craft Festival is the first of five, two-day outdoor art festivals presented by the Naples Art Association . The festival serves as a fundraiser for the nonprofit organization, which operates The von Liebig Art Center, supports individual artists and helps provide educational programs for the community. While admission is free, a $5 requested donation will be gratefully accepted at the festival entrance to support NAA's ongoing, community-supporting arts programming. With paintings in oil and acrylic, watercolors, drawings in pastels, charcoal, pen and ink and graphite, 2D and 3D mixed media works and collages, photography and digital artworks, bronze and metal sculpture, wood working, ceramics, pottery, glass fusion and glass art, hand-crafted art jewelry, leather works and more, there really is something for every taste and budget, making the festival an outdoor occasion the whole family can enjoy. "This is a wonderful opportunity for residents to bring their guests, shop unique small business owners, and purchase hand crafted gifts while enjoying the beautiful weather in Paradise," says Executive Director Aimee Schlehr. Because festival season in Southwest Florida is just getting under way, many of the artists in this holiday show are from Florida, but talented artists from Oregon, New York, Tennessee, Indiana, Pennsylvania and elsewhere will also be on hand. For those supporting the Shop Small Business Saturday cause, the Naples Fall Fine Art &amp; Craft Festival encourages the public to consider a purchase from an independent professional fine artist like those who show their work in juried festivals. As small business owners, they may be overlooked amid the clamour for big box store sales, but their unique and creative wares make great gifts that aren't available anywhere else. Festival attendees may choose to support the less fortunate this holiday season too. The United States Marine Corps Reserve will be collecting donations for Toys for Tots at the festival. Anyone who brings a new, unwrapped toy to donate will be entered into a drawing for fantastic prizes. The festival takes place on 10th Street South in downtown Naples, near the Naples Depot. There is plenty of free parking for fair goers. This show is generously sponsored by Costco, Naples Daily News, Lite 93.7, Southwest Florida Happenings Arts and Entertainment Magazine and WAVV 101.1. The Naples Art Association is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Founded in 1954 by local artists, NAA's mission is to educate and promote visual arts in Southwest Florida. Through its programs, the Naples Art Association is dedicated to serving individual artists of all ages and skill levels, along their creative journeys. The von Liebig Art Center is located at 585 Park Street in downtown Naples and is open Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Saturdays in season.
