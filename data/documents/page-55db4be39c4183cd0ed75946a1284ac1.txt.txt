 For those who didn’t check out this excellent animated feature at the Ross last year, you’ve got to watch it tonight. “Chico &amp; Rita” follows Chico, a young Cuban pianist drawn out of 1940s Havana to make it in the states as a big-band jazz star, and Rita, the enchanting vocalist who Chico is helplessly in love with.

                            'The East’ delivers edge-of-seat suspense while challenging viewer’s world view

 When we think of summer blockbusters or “popcorn films,” we think “Transformers,” “Avatar,” “Star Trek” and the like. Films adapted from comic books or toys that contain big explosions and will make one think for a few seconds, if we’re lucky. We’d look at the cinema in a new way if we treated truly tense thrillers that also pose complicated questions like “The East” does as the true “popcorn film” viewing experience. I didn’t have any popcorn during my screening, so I resorted to chewing my fingernails to the bone.

 When we think of summer blockbusters or “popcorn films,” we think “Transformers,” “Avatar,” “Star Trek” and the like. Films adapted from comic books or toys that contain big explosions and will make one think for a few seconds, if we’re lucky. We’d look at the cinema in a new way if we treated truly tense thrillers that also pose complicated questions like “The East” does as the true “popcorn film” viewing experience. I didn’t have any popcorn during my screening, so I resorted to chewing my fingernails to the bone.

 Dr. Valerie Capers is a classical and jazz pianist as well as an accomplished educator, who has received two degrees from Juilliard and two honorary doctorates, one from Nebraska’s Doane College.

 As students, young adults or parents supporting their families, we all understand how expensive food can be. We might be busy with classes, jobs and extra-curriculars and don’t have time to prepare, so we eat out or speed through shopping, missing opportunities.
