My order was shipped on Monday and I received my white door edge trim on Wednesday , all the way from Oregon to Indiana! Will buy from you guys again, thanks. Kevin M. Rating: Excellent Comments: I just wanted to let you know that the lug key that you suggested worked! You saved me a lot of time and money with your help. Thanks for the time that you spent. Being a less expensive item,you could have just told me that you didn't have anything and left it at that. But you didn't, and again I thank you! You can be assured that if I ever need anything in the future, your company will be the first that i check with! Thanks again! Jim B. Rating: Excellent Comments: One of the easiest transactions I've had online. Shipping was very fast, and the lug nuts were exactly what I needed. Adam G. Rating: Excellent Comments: Consistently Excellent Service - This is the second time I have ordered Edge Molding from BrandSport. Both times the customer service was great; they answered all of my questions and provided information I didn't think to ask. The product is exactly what I need and I received my order days before I expected it. Their sample cards work really well when trying to match colors. I have in the past and will continue to recommend BrandSport. Lynn F. Rating: Excellent Comments: Fast, easy to order from, extremely quick shipping!!! I will do business with again in the future, and I would recommend this site to family and friends for things they need as well!!! Thank You!!!! Mark L. Rating: Excellent Comments: The whole process was intuitive, quick and easy. Product is excellent. I am very pleased. David E. Rating: Excellent Comments: Shipping to Hawaii was very reasonable. My order was processed very quickly. And before I knew it, I received it packed nicely in the mail. I'm very satisfied with this merchant. (Name not disclosed) Rating: Excellent Comments: Found store through a random shopping search on google (sorry yahoo...) Easy to search and shop throughout their site and my transaction was flawless. Shipping was ahead of schedule which was a pleasant surprise. From their store in Oregon, I had it standard ground shipped too me across country to the coast of Maryland. All in all, everything was as advertised. Will absolutely recommend to friends and shop Brandsport again. Thomas C.
