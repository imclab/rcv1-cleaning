Photo by Jacob Hutchings. An IFC Films release. By BETSY SHARKEY BETSY SHARKEY The Dallas Morning News Los Angeles Times Published: 27 September 2012 02:36 PM Updated: 27 September 2012 02:36 PM L iberal Arts is a light and lively comedy of manners about college, literature and a midlife crisis that hits earlier than expected. The bookish group at the heart of this talky film — Josh Radnor, Elizabeth Olsen, Richard Jenkins, Zac Efron and Allison Janney — is having such a grand time trading tart exchanges that their mood proves infectious. The sparring helps offset some of the contrivances that make Liberal Arts less buttoned up than it should be — so an A for effort and a C for execution. Radnor, who also writes and directs, plays Jesse, a guy caught in a conundrum. He’s a university admissions counselor in New York City, now 35, but not yet able to let go of a lingering nostalgia for his Midwest college days. Jesse returns to campus for a retirement dinner for one of his favorite English professors, Peter Hoberg (Jenkins). The film shifts from fond memories to a more thorny present when Jesse meets a fetching young student, Zibby (Olsen). There is an undeniable something between them. Just what that something is, or can become, remains uncertain. Zibby is 19, and it’s been 16 years since Jesse was that age. Since their flirtation is forcing the coming-of-age issues, there should be a visible attraction. But the filmmaker does a better job in drawing out the couple’s differences than igniting a spark. When they go back to Zibby’s dorm room to “make out,” it’s priceless to watch Jesse’s discomfort as it dawns on him just how absurd the situation is. Olsen continues to show that her breakthrough in Martha Marcy May Marlene was not a fluke. She has a gift for finding the right note for her characters, and she’s made Zibby just innocent enough and astute enough to be a compelling complicating factor. Janney and Jenkins simply never hit a false note. This is Radnor’s second film and relies on the same gentle humor to carry it that made 2010’s Happythankyoumoreplease such a festival favorite. It’s more of a nudge in the ribs than the biting style of humor that has come to dominate today’s comedies and makes for a nice change. LIBERAL ARTS (B) Directed by Josh Radnor. Not rated. 97 mins.
