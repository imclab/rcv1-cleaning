If so, you should know that it takes great care and precision to properly restore a scratched vehicle's body to like-new condition. Thanks to advanced experience and access to high-performance tools, it is generally recommended that you leave automotive scratch repair to the professionals. Matching Automotive Car Paint DIY paint repair kits are designed to help drivers fill in scratches on their own. However, retail car paint products tend to be somewhat limiting when it comes to available paint colors. This means that you may have difficulty finding a perfect match for your car's factory paint job. Of course, all the expertise and patience in the world won't result in a quality repair if you can't get the paint colors to match. In contrast, auto body shops have access to paint mixing technologies that allow them to perfectly match the new paint color to your vehicle's original paint job. This ensures a seamless repair that completely erases all signs of that unsightly scratch. The Automotive Scratch Repair Process Completing an effective scratch repair requires several hours of detail-oriented work, and may even require two or more days in some cases. There are numerous steps involved in repairing an automotive scratch, including sanding, cleaning, priming, painting and protecting. Depending on the size of the scratch, the job may require as many as 24 layers of paint. Of course, time must be allowed in between each application to allow for the previous layer to dry. Ensuring a smooth, even finish can also be difficult. Auto shops have access to compressed air guns that apply paint in a smooth, even fashion. Hand painting, on the other hand, may result in an uneven finish. Benefits of Professional Automotive Scratch Repair While hiring a professional to perform your automotive scratch repair may cost you more in the long run, the end result will likely be exceptionally better than could be achieved with a DIY job. Body shop technicians have considerable experience with repairing scratched paint, and therefore have the expertise necessary to complete the job as quickly and efficiently as possible. As such, if you're looking to save time and headaches, as well as achieve the best results, choosing a professional technician likely the best way to go.
