View Eddie Bauer Adventurer Travel System User Review for Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat 5.00 rating Amazing by Alishia klynstra This is the best car seat ever. Well worth the money as not only does my 6month old daughter enjoy it, but I know she is safe.... View Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat User Review for Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat 5.00 rating Love it! by Isabella Momma I really like this car seat. The seat is nice and wide for the my daughter to grow and the back pad in removeable for her to sit more comfortablely as she gets longer. She is only nine months but it fits her perfect. Its also light enough to change from car to car as needed. The reclining quality is perfect as she faces the rear. Fit wonderful in my nissan Altima. View Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat User Review for Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat 5.00 rating Grandmother by no This is the carseat my daugher wanted for her son View Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat User Review for Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat 5.00 rating Best carseat out there by MomOfOneWeeOne This is the second Britax I've purchased, as we have a Roundabout in my husband's car. I only wished we had purchased a Britax sooner! My daughter hated riding in the car as a newborn, but from the moment we put her in the Britax, she's been a happy passenger. I like that she'll be able to use the Marathon for such a long time, and can ride rear-facing up to 35 lbs. (Please put your children rear facing as long as the weight limit allows!! It's so much safer, despite the temptation to turn them around as soon as they hit the 1-year & 20 lbs mark. Please do your research!) We have zero complaints about the Marathon, it's a sturdy seat and easy to install - just follow the directions. The customer stories on the Britax website are worth a read too - this seat can literally save your child's life. Worth every penny. View Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Convertible Car Seats Convertible Car Seats can be used from the time your baby would use an Infant Seat all the way through the time when your toddler would use a Booster Seat , allowing you to purchase a single Car Seat to fit all your child's needs instead of 2 or 3 separate seats. Most models of convertible car seats can handle a child anywhere from 5-65 lbs with some seats going up to 100lbs. It is not always recommended to put a child in a convertible car seat until he or she is near 20-22 lbs, but many convertible car seats like the Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat can accommodate a child right from infant up to 100 lbs. The main feature of a convertible car seat which is different than other models of car seat is that they can adapt to suit the needs of your growing child and feature an adjustable harness to fit your child. Convertible car seats generally have padding in the side of the car seat for side impact protection (SIP) and they are generally LATCH equipped. Some of the top models of convertible car seat include the Britax Pavilion 70-G3 , the Graco Smart Seat All-In-One Seat and the Evenflo Triumph 65 LX Convertible Car Seat . We offer a wide variety of Car Seat Covers &amp; Bases and Other Car Seat Accessories to help customize your seat and provide added convenience. today's news Celebrity Babies Blog The latest news of celebrity parents, the products they use and activities they enjoy with their kids Adorably.com Premium outlet shoppes for everything adorable&trade;.
