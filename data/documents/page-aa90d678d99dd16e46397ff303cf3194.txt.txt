If the new Batman has one thing going for him, it's Ben Affleck's Boston roots. Think about it. What could possibly be more powerful than a superhero weaned on Legal Seafood clam chowder and Dunkin' Donuts dark roast? Comments Remember, Miley Cyrus Is Someone's Daughter Carla Molina Writer Miley is a celebrity who has her choices plastered all over the Internet. Today she's a 20-year-old woman making 20-year-old woman choices. It's not to say she isn't still that sweet young lady but she's also a business woman with an agenda and a persona to promote. Comments (51) 'The Real Housewives of Orange County' Recap: Reunion Part 3 Heather Wagner Author, "Friend or Faux" and "Happiness on $10 a Day" Alexis hugs a sobbing Vicki and the rest of the cast, one by one, in their luminously tacky evening gowns, all surround her and offer their condolences. No matter how facile a friendship, no matter how shallow a bond, when a woman sees another woman broken down because of a man there is a Darwinian instinct to hug. Comments  Put Harry Styles Down, You'll Break Him! Morgan Hegarty Pre-journalism freshman at the University of Oregon I love talking about celebrities, but I would hate to be the reason they shatter into a million pieces. So put Harry Styles down before you break him. Comments  Who Plays Batman Matters Troy Campbell Social Scientist, Duke University Will Affleck suck or succeed as Batman? That remains uncertain. However, one thing was made certain this week certain: We Americans care who plays Batman. Comments (49) 51 Pieces of Movie Trivia You May Not Know David Brake Freelance writer, script developer #9: Ryan Gosling was cast as Noah in The Notebook because the director wanted someone "not handsome." Comments (232) Why Are We so Angry With Miley? Aliza Polkes Student, Columbia Univ.; Editor, 'Quarto' There is the argument that Miley is a role model to young girls, and that her new rebellious and overtly sexual persona sends a bad messages to her prepubescent fans. Well, she's no longer 12-years-old. Comments (39) The Top 10 Worst Video Music Awards Outfits of All Time Vanity Fair Vanity Fair MTV's Video Music Awards telecast has been celebrating the finest cinematic feats from its industry's biggest artists since 1984. But despite this purportedly aesthetic bent, the outfits worn by its attendees are not always quite so visually appealing. Comments  In Defense of Miley Cyrus: Use Your Hate to Love Taylor Swift, or Back Off Jessica Kane Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post All I ask is that the world gives her a little less flak for her this rebellious and ostentatious stage. And if you simply can't do that, maybe you can try to care a little bit less. Comments  Weeklings! : Why 'Roar' Gets No Applause (VIDEO) Louis Virtel West Coast Entertainment Editor, TheBacklot.com Katy Perry or Lady Gaga? Colonial law dictates that you can only enjoy one, so which is it going to be? In this edition of Weeklings!, I tell you why Katy Perry's new (and very successful) single "Roar" is unworthy of your vote, time, $1.29, and grace. Comments (12) Memories of Distant Places Marlo Thomas Award-winning actress, author and activist As the child of a performer who was always on the go, I grew up on the road. My family would travel with my father from city to city, always staying in the best room of the hotel because he was the star performer. I was eight years old before I realized that every hotel room didn't come with a piano! Comments (78) An Interview with Marina Abramović: Art, Science and the Marina Abramović Institute Stephanie Spiro Culture Critic, Curator and Writer, living in New York City "One boy said that he came to the Kickstarter from Lady Gaga's page and spent 11 hours researching performance art and drinking water slowly. This makes me very happy, because I hope the institute will be this kind of resource for a new generation of artists, scientists and thinkers." Comments  Emily Maynard: Single Mom Superstar Kerri Zane Single mom adviser and healthy living expert Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking with Emily about raising her daughter on her own, the joy's and struggles of being a single mom, her new jewelry business and what the future holds for her and Ricki. Comments  Private Parts: A Male Take on the Jennifer Aniston Baby Banter Simon Thompson Film Journalist, Broadcaster and Producer As much as I'm sure we'd all like to know, ultimately, it's none of our business. When we get down the nitty-gritty, and if we're really honest with ourselves, we're just being nosey... even if we're being well-meaning. Jennifer's a lovely woman, I'm sure she'd make a great mum but... it's also, ultimately, still none of our damn business. Comments  15 Minutes With Morgan Freeman Jon Steely Los Angeles-based writer On the day I interview Morgan Freeman, I'm sick as a dog. Trembling with fever. Throat burning and ears screaming. Hacking like Charles Bukowski. I start talking with Freeman, and everything clears up. Comments  How to Announce Divorce, Hollywood-Style Susan Campos Journalist, Beautyundercover It's one thing to live through the trauma of a break-up, it's quite another to have to relive it again and again every time you run into someone. Wouldn't it be nice if we could just send out some kind of divorce announcement and just get it done with all at once? Comments  Orson Welles' Timeless Take on American Politics Dan Siegel Writer, Social Entrepreneur and Speaker on Politics, Film and Civil Society Orson Welles' observations on American and world politics, even 30 years later, are relevant for our times.

We appreciate the business and hope he'll come back soon. But do it as a tourist, as a student, as a wildlife enthusiast or sportsman. Alaska is here for people to enjoy, not haphazardly decode. Comments (20) Keri Russell on the Art of Eating, Afternoon Wine, and Bad Music Bon Appetit Bon Appétit Magazine For Austenland star Keri Russell, an afternoon glass of wine is totally fine. Bad music? Not so much. Comments  Zerrie Bizzy Emerson 17-year-old student from Chicago When I told my 13-year-old brother about the impending nuptials, he noted the tinge of sadness in my voice. "Are you sad your little One Direction is growing up?" he asked. I realized that I kind of am. Comments  The Incredible Impact of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Medical Marijuana Special Tony Newman Director of Media Relations, Drug Policy Alliance I've worked at the Drug Policy Alliance for 14 years -- and more people, even folks who don't follow drug policy, have asked me about the Sanjay Gupta special than almost anything else I've worked on over the past decade and a half. Comments (93) The Letter I Never Sent to Elmore Leonard Ashley Woods Detroit Editor, The Huffington Post When you work for The Huffington Post, your job is to cover breaking news, not cry over it. But that was my first impulse when I heard that Elmore Leonard, America's foremost mystery writer of the last century, had passed away at home Tuesday. Comments (15) Obsessing Over Kim Kardashian's Baby Photos at an Oklahoma City Funeral-Cum-Public Appearance Lauren Duca Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post The recent paparazzi shots of North West draped in a blanket are so indistinguishable that they could be photos of any other baby. They could be photos of a small cat or rhesus monkey. And yet, the media is predictably freaking out.
