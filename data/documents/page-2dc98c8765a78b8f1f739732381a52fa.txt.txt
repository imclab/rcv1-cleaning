Rated 4 out of 5 &#9733;Â by shortt3 Beautiful, but......... This TV console was exactly what I was looking for. Perfect size, style and color. The assembly instructions, however, are terrible and 3 pieces were not drilled properly for fasteners. Actually 2 rear vertical center supports were not drilled at all for the 4 screws to secure center unit which carries doors and component shelf and the rear bottom horizontal support cam lock holes were drilled on the outside making them visible. Perhaps there have been design changes because the 4 screws were not in hardware package anyway. I would still recommend this product because there is very little out there in this style and configuration. Just needs a little tweaking. 01/09/2011 Rated 5 out of 5 &#9733;Â by lara78 Awsome TV Stand! This was a little tricky to put together at first, its definitely a two person job!
