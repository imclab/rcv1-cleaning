Emotional, explicit award winner &#x2018;Spring Awakening&#x2019; coming to Crown Uptown   By Bob Curtright | July 26 at 3:59 p.m.   &#x201C;Spring Awakening,&#x201D; which opens Friday at Crown Uptown Theatre, won eight Tony Awards on Broadway in 2006 and four Olivier Awards in London &#x2013; including best musical on both sides of the Atlantic.

Sliger wants her gallery to be a place where artists can rent out space to show off their creativity while she handles the commercial side of marketing and sales.

It will likely get smoother and more streamlined as cast members settle more comfortably into their sometimes improvisational roles.
