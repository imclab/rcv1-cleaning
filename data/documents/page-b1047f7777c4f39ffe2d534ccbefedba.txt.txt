June 22, 2011 4 Certified Auto Exchange Inc Maurice Montemurro President Certified Auto Exchange Inc. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734; . A used car is used. Some of the parts are worn already, you need to find out what they are before you buy and what your willing to do to the car and put into it. Have it checked by a mechanic first and get an Auto check report on it. Ask what has already been done to it? Some drivers never take care of a automobile.Can you see how they drive on the road. Do research on the reviews of the car. Many cars now a days should last up to 150,000 miles or more. If you bought 3 cars from that same dealer, something made you come back 3 times? We do what we say and say what we do! Keeping our word. Oh, by the way when you lost that same $3000.00 in Atlantic City did you Slander Ceasers Palace or Trump Plaza? Many buyers that come in the door haggle every drop of profit. Thats why they call us Dealers we deal. Bad or good, like cards or a crap shoot thats the hand we both play win or loose on either side. Did you you take a warranty or were you so penny wise and dollar foolish? As is means As is! No insurance no repair! You did it to yourself. So blame =? Do the math. Was this review helpful to you?

Refused to refund anything. Worst experience I have ever had! Was this review helpful to you? Harold D. March 26, 2011 1 Certified Auto Exchange Inc Let the Buyer Beware! &#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; Deception and misinformation seem to be the norm at this dealership. Even their own employees are unhappy with the owner/salesperson &quot;Moe&quot; and his practices. Let the buyer beware of this dealership. To be avoided at all costs. Was this review helpful to you? Christine D. January 01, 2008 1 Certified Auto Exchange Inc 1999 Dodge &#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734; My husband and I found the vehicle purchased from Certified Auto on Cars.Com. We took it for a test drive and it seemed fine. The operator advised us that if there was anything wrong, they would do anything they could to help us, being that they had a mechanic on staff. Well, when we took it to our mechanic, we found it needed $3,000 worth of work. We I contacted them, in hopes they could fix the shocks and brakes, to help us out. They changed there tune and accused us of deception. I do not recommend them to anyone. They stink. Was this review helpful to you?
