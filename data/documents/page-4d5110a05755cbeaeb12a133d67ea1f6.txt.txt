Now subtract 1000 pounds. You should have the picture painted by the Superlite Coupe, or SL-C, a $179,000 turnkey kit car from Rapier Automotive. Based on the body produced by Race Car Replicas, the mid-engine SL-C boasts an all-aluminum, TIG-welded monocoque chassis and space frame hybrid, along with your choice of three Corvette powertrains. The base engine is the 6.2-liter LS3 with 480 horsepower. The next step up is the Z06&#8242;s 505-horsepower 7.0-liter LS7, while the ZR1&#8242;s supercharged, 638-horsepower LS9 tops the pack. The transmission, a six-speed manual from Ricardo, routes power to the rear wheels. Brake rotors measure 13 inches front and 11.8 inches rear with six-piston calipers on both ends, and Rapier puts the curb weight at 2375 pounds. The suspension consists of pushrod-actuated coil-over shocks front and rear. Results? With the LS7, Rapier&#8217;s performance claims include 3.2-second 0-to-60 mph acceleration and a 10.6-second quarter mile time. Top speed is 222 mph. Boston-based Rapier, named after the thin, pointy swords used in fencing, takes roughly nine months to build an SL-C after a customer has placed a 50 percent deposit. After placing an order, Rapier builds the SL-C around the customer&#8217;s dimensions, adjusting floor level, headroom clearance, steering and pedal position, and seat size. There&#8217;s also a payment plant to have the car paid off when it&#8217;s ready for delivery.

BilboBaggins  5pts Go Speed Racer, Go Speed Racer, Go Speed Racer GOOOOOO!  Bennichen  5pts great speed, great price..  Alaopolitan  5pts I'd take one if someone handed me the keys and said, "It's yours, no strings attached." It's certainly attractive in every dimension."There's also a payment [bold]plant[/bold] to have the car paid off when it's ready for delivery." Where can this magical money-plant be found in nature and how can I force one to start making my monthly payments? :p  carrgirl1  5pts not that the doors would be open all the time...  carrgirl1  5pts i like everything about this car except the doors. on some cars, these doors like awesome but i think because the car has so many other details, the doors make it look too busy. not that that would keep me from buying the car :p  gogogodzilla  5pts Having them build a car custum to your individual dimensions...damn, super exotics could learn a thing or two here.Thats just cool in general though.  ideadman  5pts I think this thing looks fantastic. I love the racing style sticking out rear spoiler and shape. Interior could use work but its a kit so cant expect too much  MotorTrend on Instagram  Home | New Cars | Used Cars | Car Reviews | Auto Shows | Future Cars | Car Prices | Car Pictures | Auto Rebates | Site Map Dealer | Car Dealers | Car Insurance | MT Classic | Subscribe | Give a Gift | Subscriber Services | MT Classic Subscription Espanol | | Licensing | Reprints | User Submitted Content | Privacy Policy | Ad Choices | Advertise with Us | Contact Us | Terms of Use  &copy; 2013 MotorTrend Magazine , Source Interlink Media All rights reserved.
