Technically, this is a logical way to separate them, but there is another category of its own: certified pre-owned. These specially designated used cars offer higher end coverage and quality without the new car price tag. Certified pre-owned cars require lots of leg work on the part of dealership and must pass rigorous standards to make the cut. Each manufacturer has a different set of pre-requisites and warranty offerings. Warranties vary, but are always factory-backed, which means the warranty policies are dictated by the manufacturer. Any repairs may be made at any Performance Auto dealership in Kansas City, Kan., Independence, Mo., and Lincoln or Omaha,Neb. So if you if it's quality and assurance you're looking for, but aren't willing to dish out the cash for a brand new vehicle, certified pre-owned may be your best bet. Though CPO programs differ by manufacturer, there are fundamental elements of a certified pre-owned vehicle that come standard across the board, like the following: CARFAX Vehicle History Report Buyer receives a detailed inspection list The same (or sometimes extended) warranty as if buying the car new Repair of any current body and engine issues, making sure car is in top condition before sold All certified pre-owned vehicle must have no aftermarket modifications Other advantages of certified pre-owned vehicles include the following: Avoiding unforeseen maintenance costs that would not be covered with the purchase of an un-certified used vehicle.
