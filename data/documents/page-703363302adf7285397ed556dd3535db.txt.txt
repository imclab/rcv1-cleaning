As a result, auto dealers badly need trade-ins and are willing to pay top dollar. Often the notice comes as a flier in the mail, but you might get a friendly phone call from the salesman who sold you a new car a few years ago. The dealership is paying top dollar for trade-ins, you're told, and now is the perfect time for you to sell your vehicle. In sum, your new-car dealer really wants your used car. There are about 260 million cars on America's roads. Why is your 3-, 4- or 5-year-old machine so special? It's because, for the car business, these are unusual times. The changing car market According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics , 10.6 million new vehicles were sold or leased in the United States in 2009 (the latest year for which the bureau has reports), while 35.5 million used vehicles swapped hands. The best and worst used cars That 10.6 million new-car market was a big down year for the industry -- down from 13.5 million units in 2008, 16.5 million in 2007 and more than 17 million in both 2006 and 2005. Used-car sales also dropped between 2005 and 2009, but only about half as much on a percentage basis. Car sales have recovered somewhat since 2009 (despite the effects of Japan's tsunami, which has restricted availability of some new Hondas and Toyotas). Edmunds.com projects that 2011 new-car sales are likely to come in around 12.9 million units, and, according to the Manheim Auto Auctions, just under 37 million used cars swapped hands last year. The used-car market has always dwarfed the new-car market in unit sales, and many, if not most, dealers make more money on their used-car sales than they do on new cars. But when new-car sales are down, dealers have fewer used-car trade-ins to sell. So with 2009 new-vehicle sales representing about 60% of what they were in 2005, up to 40% fewer used cars were being traded in. Those declines have meant there are a lot fewer of the prime, low-mileage, late-model used cars around to sell in dealer lots. In particular, with gasoline prices higher this year, there aren't a lot of late-model small used cars such as the Honda Civic , Toyota Corolla and Ford Focus around, and demand for them is up. "Strong consumer demand for small used cars is driving prices up," Jonathan Banks, a senior analyst with the National Automobile Dealers Association Used Car Guide, said in a news release. "The NADA Guide increase in trade-in values for June should come as no surprise because it reflects a shortage of both new and used cars entering the market." In May, NADA projected trade-in values for small cars to rise 18% during the first half of 2011, compared with the first half of 2010. The differences in value can be startling. Even in one month, values for used small cars have skyrocketed. For instance, the NADA Used Car Guide had the trade-in value of a 2009 Kia Rio at $6,400 in May and by June had raised that to $7,500. That's a 17% rise in just one month. You're not getting that kind of return on your savings account. Even the value of something as old as the 2005 Subaru Impreza RS is rising, up from $6,650 in May to $7,575 in June. Values are up so sharply for some cars that it's tempting to trade in a car that's only about a year old. For instance, a new 2010 Honda Civic DX coupe carried a $15,455 sticker price (plus taxes, license and delivery). Today that same car has a NADA trade-in value of $14,075. That's a drop of only $1,380 over a year. "A lot of lessees and buyers will find they're on the right side of their leases or loans," Banks told MSN Money. "If they trade in their cars, they'll find they have some money for a down payment." It's all about supply and demand. Dealers want your car because they have buyers for solid late-model used cars lined up, and there simply aren't enough cars for them out there. And they may as well try to get your car now, before it's worth even more next month. Plus, they wouldn't mind selling you, the supercreditworthy person that you are, a new one to replace it. You are supercreditworthy, aren't you?

I don't have excellent credit, and didn't have in '07 when I had no choice but to buy a vehicle. Although I had the money to cover tax, titile, license, and about 5 percent down, the dealer couldn't find someone to finance a 3 year old vehicle for 18 months. When the finance department ran thru a loan request for a new truck for 60 months, with barely enough money to cover tax, title, and license, about 3 loan companies were urging the dealer to get me to sign with them. I selected the best deal out of the three. Now they tell me I owe more than the truck is worth.      52      3 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... Coldoldgold Jul 15, 2011 12:15PM If you look back a few years, all of this makes sense. It all goes back to the cash for clunkers program. The reality is, over x number of years,&#160;demand for new cars is largely inelastic, meaning it responds very little to market price. There are two reasons for this: 1. a new car is a durable good. It lasts a number of years&#160;and yields utlilty to the consumer over the course of the car's life. 2. a new car is also a luxury good, given that there is a cheaper substitute in the marketplace that will yield more or less the same amount of utility to the consumer. (the main difference is durability) When cash for clunkers was implemented, it increased the amount of utility per unit cost of a new car. This, for many consumers, made it more worthwhile to buy a new car now than in the future, as well as more worthwhile to buy a&#160;new car now instead of a used car now (given increased utility from increased durability) However, since new cars are a durable good, those who bought a new car during the cash for clunkers program are still enjoying most of the utility from the use of their new car. People who ordinarily would be buying cars right now decided it was in their best interests to buy a car during the cash for clunkers program. This is why there is a current decline in demand for new cars. The main thing the cash for clunkers program did was to rob demand from the future to increase demand at present, all at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer. We are currently feeling the effects of the demand that was robbed&#160; from the new car markets 2 years ago.      58      12 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... WorkingDad40 Jul 15, 2011 12:17PM For the posters talking about not paying a lot for vehicles it is really relative to your income and you can use that logic with any major purchase such as a house as well. My advice has typically been to pay no more than half your income in terms of the value of the car (new)&#160;putting 10%-20% of the total purchase down and financing the rest for 4 years. If you can do that your car will cost no more than 11.5% of your income. &#160; While I agree the need factor for a new car may not be a great argument, I prefer to have a car that if something goes wrong with it I can go to the dealership and make them fix it under warranty. I also like the fact that it has the latest safety standards like side impact air bags that you will not find on cars from the 80's. &#160; For most the problem becomes buying more car(s) than you can afford, but we already know this has been a problem with purchases in general for the American public as we learned with the housing crisis. If you learn to live below your means you will find that one day you have more money than you need, no longer need credit, and can buy your toys with cash.      52      6 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... blondedallas Jul 15, 2011 2:58PM My Audi dealer sent me a letter in the mail wanting to buy back my 09 Audi A5 S-Trim, 19,000 miles (in sept i will have had it 3 years, so VERY low miles).&#160; I had my car serviced by the dealership so they had all my service records and knew i had low miles and the car was in excellent shape.&#160; I did not reply to the letter they sent, so they then called me at home (told them not interested) then, they called me 2 mores times at work trying to "entice" me - saying i could trade in and get a brand new one and keep the same pmt.&#160; I told them "no" again - i have 2 more pmts till its paid in full and i dont want to start all over again with payments!&#160; They were persistent and used just about every trick in the book to get me to let them buy it back.&#160;&#160; .....now i know why!!!!!      42      10 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... clarkkent Jul 15, 2011 11:12AM I drive a 1987 BMW 325is with only 98,000 miles on it.&#160; Paid $5,000 6 years ago when it had 49,000 miles on it.&#160; Paid $1,000 for my previous 1985 BMW and drove it for 7 years until it had 300,000 miles and the clutch just started to go bad at that point.&#160; NO WAY a dealer is going to convince me to sell MY car just to go back into car payments, title and tax, sales tax, etc.&#160; The previous poster nailed it, $30,000 to $40,000 for a car?!&#160; NOT A CHANCE!      41      11 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... Someone (jupmod) Jul 15, 2011 10:00AM This maybe good if you have the right model, but not *all * used cars will give you back money. &#160; I have a 2002 Mercury Sable SL with more than 130,000 miles on it. I know for sure I will *not* be getting a lot of money if I trade it in, especially given it's not fuel efficiant (23 mpg). Give the prices of new cars, I might as well keep it for a few more years to see whether the price of a good EV will go down for me to afford one.      34      6 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... T. Fox (Wylde007) Jul 15, 2011 11:43AM It makes great sense to the auto dealers because when you come in to get a "great price" for your trade-in, they have nearly exclusive opportunity to sell you a brand-new car.&#160; Even at or below dealer invoice they make money and it looks good to their bottom line to SELL YOU A NEW CAR when they turn their books at the end of the fiscal year. It is about dealer performance - and EVERYONE knows (or should know) that you will get 10-30% LESS for your vehicle as a trade-in than you would selling it yourself. Do your homework and don't get scammed into a new vehicle (which will cost you much more over its lifetime in interest, insurance and taxes) than a vehicle you likely already own or nearly own.      39      13 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply...

DrMike Jul 15, 2011 11:45AM Remember that the Congress which you elected has largely exempted auto dealers from the requirements of the new Consumer Protection Act. Does anyone really have to wonder why they spent millions buying that exemption from your members of Congress who always have their hands out for bribes ("campaign contributions")?&#160; Surely anyone who has ever been in an auto dealership knows the answer.&#160; Is there such a thing as an auto sale, new or used, at a dealership that isn't at least on some level fraudulent?&#160; I don't know but have read books on the subject by authors who do and it seems that the answer is a resounding "NO"!&#160; Personally, I will never buy a new car.&#160; My current vehicle is 14 years old, was the highest rated by Consumer Reports (the only publication about such products that I trust) for safety (IIHS, I ignore the gov't. crash data) and best frequency of repair rate.&#160; It has certainly lived up to those standards and I never have it serviced at the dealer's.&#160; By the way, ever wonder why "service" is such a large part of a dealership's profit?&#160; I walked into an expensive auto brand dealership two years ago.&#160; There were 4 "service advisors" there all sitting behind a large counter with smiles on their faces.&#160; Each wore an identical $5000+ watch.&#160; They were obviously rewards from the owner for what?&#160; I listened for a while to what they were telling customers at the desk and over the phone.&#160; Then I knew the answer.      36      30 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply...
