Some of the authors and notable personalities who will be participating in various events associated with New York Book Week include: Lee Child, Jonathan Franzen, Ira Glass, Sara Gruen, David Means, Edmund Morris and Scott Turow, among others.  Further details about New York Book Week and a listing of various events are available at: www.bookexpoamerica.com/en/New-York-Book-Week .  For further information about New York Book Week please contact Roger Bilheimer, bilheim@aol.com .  For more information about BEA please visit www.bookexpoamerica.com and connect with BEA on Twitter , Facebook , LinkedIn and YouTube .
