Now he&#8217;s back with another assault on your senses (and possibly your genitals) with &#8216;Give It 2 U&#8217; &#8211; an anthem informing you once again that even if you&#8217;d rather not, you&#8217;re getting it anyway. The new remix video featuring 2 Chainz and Kendrick Lamar has been released, and it&#8217;s here just for you. Luckily, Robin&#8217;s no longer dressed like a Foot Locker employee who you&#8217;ve asked nine times for a size 7 of those Chuck Taylors, only to be told he&#8217;s &#8220;working on it&#8221;. He is in a pinstripe suit, though, so take that as you will. Also, please try not to let your love of Kendrick Lamar diminish because he was stupid enough to take part in this travesty. I seriously wonder what&#8217;s wrong with Robin Thicke. Is he not jerking off enough? Does he have a sex addiction? Someone shed some light. Enjoy!

Well, turns out he won&#8217;t have to pay for that crime either, as the case has been dismissed due to lack of evidence. BOO. Chris Brown&#8217;s existence should be evidence enough, but I suppose that&#8217;s not how the court of law works. From TMZ: Good news for Chris Brown &#8212; for once &#8212; the singer WON&#8217;T be prosecuted for allegedly attacking a female clubgoer at an O.C. bar back in June &#8230; TMZ has learned. We broke the story &#8230; 24-year-old Deanna Gines claimed CB violently shoved her down at Heat Ultra Lounge &#8230; causing serious damage to her knee. But Deanna&#8217;s claims seemed fishy from the get go &#8230; CB and the club&#8217;s owner said she was full of it. Not to mention we got video of her walking around on her &#8220;injured&#8221; leg minutes after the alleged incident. Now, it seems the Anaheim City Attorney also smelled BS &#8230; &#8217;cause the office rejected the case last week citing insufficient evidence. As for Deanna, she&#8217;s still trying to sue Chris for her so-called suffering. Good luck with that. We should all be a little bit nicer to Chris, I suppose. He might have another seizure and it would be all our fault . Maybe this Deanna girl is just trying to make money off him, but I tend to side with anyone who hates Chris Brown.

Here&#8217;s your chance! The boyband are coming out with their first fragrance, called One Moment. They&#8217;ve also released an ad for it which features the boys sniffing flowers and open bottles, holding fruit and being generally corny but sort of hilarious, as well. One Moment went on sale at Harrods over the weekend, and pre-orders were so numerous that there&#8217;s now a waiting list to get a hold of one of the £21 (approximately $30) bottles. Apparently, only four samples of it were sent out to journalists prior to its release, as well. All of this for a celebrity perfume? Seems a bit much. That being said, if any publicists would like to send me a bottle to &#8220;test&#8221; and then immediately sell on eBay, please do!

This little appearance got some people without brains excited, thinking the boyband is back together and they might do a tour together. Not unheard of, but definitely not happening for these guys. JC Chasez let everyone down gently during an interview on Ryan Seacrest &#8216;s KIIS-FM radio show (via DS ): &#8220;It was just about five guys who were great friends, who spent 10 or 15 years together touring, and we wanted to give that back to our fans, but we were there mainly to support Justin. &#8220;Literally just a few days ago, Justin gave me a buzz and he pretty much said, &#8216;Hey man, listen, I&#8217;m getting this award and they&#8217;ve given me a pile of time to perform, and we started our careers at MTV and I think we should get the band back together&#8217;.&#8221; &#8220;It really was about [Justin], and all that he&#8217;s accomplished. He wanted to acknowledge that part of his career, and so we all decided to do it.&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s nice. If only Justin was struggling a bit more financially &#8211; it would really help these dudes out and go on a reunion tour. It would definitely sell out &#8211; nostalgia is really in right now.
