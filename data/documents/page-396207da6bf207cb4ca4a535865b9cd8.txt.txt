Liddell | Oct 14, 2010 | Issue: 864 | One Comment | 2,212 views Idemitsu Museum of Art Sengai (1750-1837) was the head abbot of Shofuku-ji, a Zen Buddhist temple in Kyushu, but it’s his post-retirement career for which he’s now famous. After stepping down as chief priest, Sengai took up ink painting, turning out rough, doodle-like brushworks, often with verses or proverbs. These were done at the request of local people, including children. To commemorate the 260th anniversary of the artist’s birth, the Idemitsu Museum of Art presents Sengai: Zen and Humor , featuring about 100 works. While the artist’s most famous painting “Circle, Triangle, and Square” is believed to show the three fundamental forms of the universe, most other works avoid reductionist esotericism in favor of a warm, down-to-earth humor. Sengai’s depictions of monks, animals and figures from legend exude a carefree spirit that suggests he was enjoying his retirement to the full. Idemitsu Museum of Arts Sengai: Zen and Humor.
