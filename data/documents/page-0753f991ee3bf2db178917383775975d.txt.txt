To a Volvo enthusiast , this was a very big deal to me...I even upped my budget to fit this car. But when I went to see it, it was a disappointment. Not only was I given a test drive WITHOUT a sales person, the sales person I spoke to earlier that day (who knew I was coming) wasn't even there. The car was nothing like in the photos. Granted it's a 98 BUT you should have mentioned the fact that the body on the car was less than desirable. My 20 yr 240 has a better body that this v70R. It seemed noone was trying to make a sale on this wagon. I was ready to buy it but after driving it, dealing with poor service, and realizing that it would be at least another 1200 in body work to have it up to par, I decided to go elsewhere. The next day the "sales" person that was supposed to meet me asked me why I didn't show up...UM what? Dude I did show up, so obviously there is a communication breakdown in that office. I will also mention that when you look at the car fax they print out for you, be wise and spend that extra $20 and print one out from the actual site cause the one on the site said 71 service records and the one i got from them said like 40 something. AND the original "owner" was taking this car to get serviced every 3k...that just doesn't add up. The sad part of all this is that i really wanted this car, but the service and lack of proper truthful info...made me get a newer wagon else where. If coming to this dealership, do your homework.

Unfortunately the credit union changed the interest rate they originally quoted me. The new interest rate and shorter term would have made the payment to high. I cancelled the deal and Bobby and the other guys were absolutely gracious and totally understanding. I really hope I can do business with them in the near future, and do intend to steer as much business to this ethical group of folks. Very comfortable to do business with. A rare find!

We saw the car we wanted and within one day the deal was completed. Lenny and Bob were very pleasant and we also had some laughs, which does not often happen when purchasing a vehicle. We were very happy in dealing with these people and our transaction took place with no problem. We are very happy with the vehicle we purchased, we have had no problems and it is everything we expected it to be. Lois McDonough Was this review helpful to you?

The BMW was in excellent condition as described. Since it has arrived, driving it has only increased the value of the car; it needed to be driven as it had been sitting for some time. Bobby has been a hoot to work with and to talk to on the phone. Was this review helpful to you?
