If you do not plan to get another vehicle you can return the plates and the plate permit to any Driver and Vehicle Licence Issuing Office for cancellation. If your plates have not expired, you can apply for a refund on any remaining full months of plate validation. There is a processing fee of $5.00 for each refund. Buying a used vehicle in Ontario? Good used vehicles are in demand. With careful shopping and some research, you can find a vehicle to fit your needs. What should I look for? Did you know? Even a well-made vehicle deteriorates if it is not properly maintained. Do not be blinded by the reputation of a particular make or model. Always inspect a vehicle in the daylight. Carefully check for extreme wear of the upholstery, seats, brake and accelerator pedals. New pedals may signal the car has had a lot of use. Look closely at the exterior. Waves on the body could mean bodywork or that the vehicle has been in an accident. Take it for a road test that includes driving at different speeds and on different road conditions. The test helps evaluate the steering, brakes, shock absorbers and front-end alignment. Ask about the vehicle's accident history. If there have been accidents, get a written summary of the accident information. Ask for the Used Vehicle Information Package. Take the vehicle to your mechanic or to a diagnostic centre for a check-up before buying. Some Signs of Trouble Problems It may mean.... Steering that pulls the vehicle to one side alignment problems in the future Squealing brakes too much wear or improper adjustment Blue smoke coming from the tail pipe costly engine repairs are needed Lack of control when turning a corner at normal speeds or a very bouncy ride steering linkage problems, worn-out shock absorbers, or both Note: Odometer tampering is a criminal offence. An average vehicle gathers 16,000 to 20,000 kilometres per year. Look out for odometers showing low kilometres for the vehicle's age and signs of wear. If you believe the odometer has been tampered with report it to the police .

Motor vehicle insurance in Ontario You must have motor vehicle insurance to drive in Ontario. Whether you are attaching plates, renewing registration or buying a temporary permit, you must have insurance. Private companies sell insurance. What types of insurance do I need? You must have third party liability insurance of at least $200,000. This covers you in case you injure or kill someone or damage someone's property. Collision insurance to cover the damage to your own vehicle is a good idea, but not required by law. Do I need to carry the insurance card with me? Yes. You must carry the pink insurance card for the vehicle that you are driving (this includes your own or someone else's vehicle). You must show this card when a police officer asks for it. If you do not, you can receive a fine of up to $400. When driving someone else's vehicle, make sure the insurance covers you as a driver. Retail Sales Tax You must pay sales tax when you buy a used vehicle privately. The amount of tax is on either the purchase price or the vehicle's wholesale value, whichever is more. What is the &quot;wholesale value&quot;? Wholesale value is based on the Canadian Red Book , which lists the wholesale and retail values of used vehicles. This book is an accepted industry standard used by car dealers, insurance companies and other provincial governments. How are the wholesale and retails values determined? For personal vehicles, these values are based on the average amounts paid for vehicles of the same year, make and model. The values do not take into account optional equipment, vehicle condition, or the number of kilometres. These values can change from the date you pick up the Used Vehicle Information Package to the date of the vehicle transfer. For passenger and light commercial vehicles (2,200 kilograms and under empty weight) 20 years or older, the retail sales tax is payable on the purchase price, replacement value for insurance purposes, or appraised value, whichever is more. If you paid less than the Canadian Red Book value, you can get the vehicle appraised before changing ownership. If the appraisal supports a lower price than the Canadian Red Book, the buyer pays tax based on the higher value. An appraisal or insurance document showing the vehicle's value must accompany the bill of sale. If the vehicle transfer and tax payment based on the average wholesale value have been processed at the Driver and Vehicle Licence Issuing Office, an appraisal and an application for a tax refund must be sent to the Ministry of Revenue. Appraisal forms are available from Driver and Vehicle Licence Issuing Offices and Ministry of Revenue offices. Note: If you are buying a vehicle from a licensed motor vehicle dealer, you must pay the Harmonized Sales Tax to the dealer. If you are buying a vehicle privately, you are required to pay 13% Retail Sales Tax. Please refer to the Ministry of Revenue&rsquo;s web site at http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/tax/rst/ for further information. Tax exemption You do not have to pay retail sales tax if: You are a qualifying Diplomat or Status Indian. You can complete a transfer by showing your identity card. You receive a vehicle as a gift from a close family member, such as: Spouse Parent or step-parent Grand-parent Son or step-son Daughter or step-daughter Grandson or granddaughter Step-grandson or Step-granddaughter Son-in-law Daughter-in-law Father-in-law Mother-in-law Brother or Sister Half Siblings (siblings with a common parent) Adopted Siblings (siblings with a common parent by way of adoption) Siblings-in-law (siblings of a spouse of spouse of a sibling) Note: Only one tax-free transfer per vehicle is allowed every 12 months within your close family. For some transfers, such as gifts between close family members (describe above), are sales tax exempt if a Sworn Statement for a Family Gift of a Used Motor Vehicle in the Province of Ontario is provided when registering your vehicle at a ServiceOntario Driver and Vehicle Licence Issuing Office. Safety standards certificate To register a motor vehicle as fit, you must have a safety standards certificate. A safety standards certificate that is issued outside Ontario is not acceptable. An authorized mechanic at a government approved Motor Vehicle Inspection Station inspects the vehicle, for a fee, and issues a signed certificate if the vehicle passes inspection. The certificate is valid for 36 days from the date of the inspection. The certificate is not a warranty or guarantee on the general condition of the vehicle. You will be asked to show this certificate when you: Register a rebuilt motor vehicle Transfer a used motor vehicle to a new owner as fit Certain transfers, such as between spouses do not require a Safety Standards Certificate. However, transfers between parent and child and vice versa require a Safety Standards Certificate. For further information on vehicle transfer Safety Standards Certificate exemptions, please call ServiceOntario's Driver and Vehicle Contact Centre at (416) 235- 2999, or toll free (Canada-Wide) 1-800-387-3445 Register a motor vehicle as fit in Ontario that was previously registered in another province or country Change the status of a vehicle from unfit to fit Note : A Safety standards certificate is not required when registering a used motorized snow vehicle, off-road vehicle, motor assisted bicycle (moped), or trailer as fit.
