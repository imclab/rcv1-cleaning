We believe the odometer of 65000KM to be correct and it certainly drives like it!! BODY is very original with only some minor dings on the front as per the pics. I have tried to point out the blemishes and can Email detaled pics if required. MECHANICALLY the Corolla is very very sound. INTERIOR is very good other than the drivers seat has frayed on the edge but repairable. REGO has just expired and can be paid on the original plate. RWC can be arranged for an aditional cost if required or drive away today and arrange your own. NEED TRANSPORT?? Australia-Wide transport can be arranged (eg Brisbane $795, Davenport $495, Sydney $495, Perth $1350 etc etc) PS: FOR CONFIDENCE we are a LICENSED DEALER and follow the code of conduct expected of us by Consumer Affairs Victoria. LMCT8433  Seller Comments This listing has been placed by a professional licensed motor dealer. Buying a used vehicle from a licensed dealer is the safest way to buy. Licensed dealers are regulated by state laws that protect consumers, ensuring that the vehicle you buy is safe and comes with clear title (no outstanding finance). Although these laws differ from state to state, many vehicles purchased from a licensed motor dealer will also come with statutory or an optional warranty. Make an enquiry on this vehicle today and ask the dealer about the warranty and consumer protection offered in this state.  Please confirm vehicle details with the seller prior to purchase.
