In Hollywood, Children’s Books Morph into Movies and Money May 05, 2010 Rate this article:  Like Alice through the looking glass, the world that children discover in books can be a far different place than the world that comes to life on a movie screen. As different as those imaginary worlds may be, the filmmaking trend of adapting children&#8217;s literature classics into Hollywood blockbusters continues, and shows no signs of slowing. Children&#8217;s books have inspired movie adaptations since film&#8217;s earliest days, says Jack Snowden, academic director for the animation and gaming program at The Art Institute of Seattle . Filmmakers have always relied on visual references, such as illustrated children&#8217;s books, which is one of the reasons why storyboards are such an essential part of the filmmaking process, he says. Today, movies based on classic children&#8217;s literature, like Tim Burton&#8217;s Alice in Wonderland and Spike Jonze&#8217;s Where The Wild Things Are , are so popular because they have a ready-made audience: parents who remember the stories fondly and want to share them with their children, Snowden says. &#8220;As we were growing up, there were the Dr. Seuss books and Alice in Wonderland,&#8221; Snowden says, adding that books and movies affect children&#8217;s imaginations in different ways. &#8220;That&#8217;s how we learned to translate our images into words.&#8221; In early childhood development, Snowden says, children learn to form mental pictures from words in the absence of corresponding images. The resulting &#8220;heuristics&#8221; attach words to images, he says. Because of the volume of visual entertainment available to today&#8217;s children in the form of movies and video games, many children are visual learners rather than contemplative learners, Snowden says. &#8220;As children become more sophisticated, they&#8217;ve played with the words and images,&#8221; Snowden says. &#8220;They form what is their world, and somewhere they learn what is fantasy and what is real.&#8221; For Helen De Michiel, a filmmaker, mother of two, and co-director of the National Alliance for Media Arts & Culture , how children relate to various storytelling media depends on their natural tendencies. Some children&#8217;s imaginations thrive by learning a story from a book before watching it as a movie; others relate to the movie first, and then are interested in reading the book, she says. &#8220;Watching a film is a completely different experience than reading a book, listening to the radio, listening to music, or experiencing a theatrical production,&#8221; De Michiel says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a completely different way of interacting with culture.&#8221; Nowadays, video games and hyper-real movies filmed in HD present fantasy worlds in extraordinarily realistic ways, De Michiel says. The danger of this media, she says, is that children are unable to use their visual imaginations effectively in the real world, because it is so unlike digitally enhanced realms. Cinematic feats like Avatar , for example, produce overwhelming, intense realities through a powerful mixture of audio and visuals. Children drawn into such potent stimulation might opt out of more contemplative art forms such as reading, listening to music, or going to the theater, De Michiel says. The entertainment industry pushes the phenomenon one step further by marketing the same franchise across multiple platforms, which results in movies and games that appear so similar that children can&#8217;t distinguish between them, De Michiel says. &#8220;It can be toxic if not used in moderation,&#8221; De Michiel says. &#8220;How can you read the book after you&#8217;ve had this strong relationship to other media? More than ever, we now need to teach children to become digitally literate and understand how media operates in society, as well as in their consciousness.&#8221; Compared to 70 years ago, today&#8217;s children live in a screen age and a visual age, and can&#8217;t help but become more visual, says Ashfaq Ishaq, chairman of the International Child Art Foundation and father of a 6-year-old. Often, a movie version may encourage interest in and a demand for the book, as was the case with the Harry Potter sensation, Ishaq says. To Ishaq, both storytelling forms have their value: Whether a visual image or a page of words will encourage a child&#8217;s imagination all depends on the quality of the media. &#8220;In terms of what goes on in a child&#8217;s brain, the images and the moving images can spark as many thoughts and connect as many neurons as perhaps when a child is reading a book and being reflective about what is happening with the characters in the book,&#8221; Ishaq says. Additional studies into child development show a &#8220;fourth-grade slump,&#8221; Ishaq says, when the originality and imagination in child-produced artwork begins to plateau. Starting around age 8, many children become concerned with conforming to the outside world, he says, and the spontaneity of earlier years is overshadowed. Beyond providing the arts as a tool to inspire schoolchildren to overcome the fourth-grade slump, The International Child Art Foundation offers healing arts programs for children who&#8217;ve suffered trauma during natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the recent earthquakes in Haiti and Chile. Research has shown that the brain stores traumatic memories as images, and can make verbal communication impossible for a time. Children who have experienced severe trauma often use art to express their pain before they are able to verbalize their feelings, Ishaq says. For children fortunate enough to live without the pain of past trauma, both books and movies can play a role in building imagination, provided the medium is a work of quality, Ishaq says. To Ishaq, there is no dichotomy between a word and a visual when it comes to children. &#8220;It may be a forced dichotomy between word and visual, like the forced dichotomy between brain and heart,&#8221; Ishaq says. &#8220;They are all interrelated.&#8221;  Author: Written by freelance talent for Ai InSite Sign up for a Newsletter Design Schools, Fashion, Media Arts, and Culinary - The Art Institutes Contact Us Follow Us: Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Check out our YouTube Channel About The Art Institutes | Privacy Policy | Regulatory Information  {1} ##LOC[OK]## {1}  ##LOC[OK]## ##LOC[Cancel]## {1} ##LOC[OK]## ##LOC[Cancel]##
