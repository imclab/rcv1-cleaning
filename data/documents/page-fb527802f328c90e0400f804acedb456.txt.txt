Pros of Selling Cars Cons of Selling Cars You can determine how much money you want to make because you get paid commission which is based on the cars you sell and the profitability of each car sold.

Some days the dealerships is slow and you stand around all day waiting for customers. You can sell one car and make a $1000 or more. You can sell one car and make a mini which is $75 or $100. When selling cars you work a schedule that includes evenings, days and weekends which keeps you from getting bored with the same schedule all the time. You have to work weekends and nights. You get to drive a Demo car that is provided by the dealership. Not all dealers provide demos. You don&#8217;t have to work hard, at least physically because you work with your words and your pen. You spend hours with customers that don&#8217;t buy a car. You get to work with and meet new people everyday. Car buyers lie to you all the time. They say they will be back, but they don&#8217;t come back and then buy a car somewhere else. It is rewarding to win over a customer and sell them a car and then have them send you customers that buy cars because they trust and respect you.

KB December 29 at 8:27 pm # Hi Jake, Many of the Hi-Line dealers like their sales people to have experience because they don&#8217;t get as much traffic as the common brands so every Up needs to count. The ideal situation is to be able to sell new and used cars. very often there is more money in used cars. RP February 28 at 6:17 pm # A little outdated, but where does JakeLeblanc51 get off saying Toyota is low end? Toyota&#8217;s are more expensive upfront then most manufacturers and have a higher residual value than any vehicle on the market. Not to mention, that if you are concerned about &#8220;buying American&#8221;, Toyota employs over 30,000 Americans and the majority of the their parts/vehicles are manufactures in the states. No other car manufacturer can claim that anymore. I honestly tell customers, every now and then, &#8220;Not everyone deserves to drive a Toyota.&#8221; And it&#8217;s a fact. KB March 8 at 6:08 pm # Now that is being sold on your product. Celine October 4 at 7:02 am # I sold high end cleaning equipment (door to door) for several years right out of high school. It was rewarding learning the art of salesmanship, as I managed to get a closing average of 1/2 after lots of working studying and applying the knoweledge to my demos. Unfortunately, I became burned out after the extremely long hours. 14 hours a day for six or seven days a week can be taxing! So, I left direct sales but I still have the itch for the elation I feel when I close deals. I&#8217;m 27 years of age now and I&#8217;m seriously contemplating a career in car sales. My question is, will I be able to apply my current sales ability to selling cars or should I just forget it all and learn a different style? I&#8217;m not high pressure by any means, but I did come from the ABC (always be closing) school of thought. I&#8217;d also like to know what it takes to sell vehicles at a high end dealership. Can you procure that kind of postion when you&#8217;re brand new to the business? Lastly, what kind of potential is there for growth? For example, upper management, possibly owning your own organization etc&#8230;Thanks in advance. KB October 26 at 11:30 am # I think everybody wonders about that. You have to find middle ground somewhere, but if the other sales people aren&#8217;t eager to take UPs then you should jump in. Dothedamnthang August 5 at 6:36 am # All high-line dealers are looking for is polished people with sells experience. They don&#8217;t want people that don&#8217;t mirror the buyer.
