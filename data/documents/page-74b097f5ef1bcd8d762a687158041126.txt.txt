Share one woman's journey into the land of Mysticism and scholar , and learn Catholicism from a Bible perspective using the King James 1611 Bible . Employing humanity, humor and wit, this marriage of creative and analytical writing is also the fruition of four years of research, 80 sources, 190 Biblical passages, and the efforts of three theologians , each with a Master's Degree in Divinity . Readers experience Catholicism through songs , prayers , poetry , and descriptions of celebrations as well as face the bigotry and malice often directed at Catholics. A Faraway Ancient Country offers an intimate look at faith and challenges spiritual growth ." Tessa Hadley , British writer Georgina Hammick , British short-story writer, born in Hampshire, educated in Kenya and England; she later attended the Academie Julian, Paris, and the Salisbury School of Art. Her first collection of stories, People for Lunch (1987), was acclaimed for its wit, irony, and compassion. The stories in Spoilt (1992), her second collection, return to the affectionately depicted parochial and suburban landscapes of the earlier work, and are characterized by Hammick's customary elegance of style; here, however, her skill with satirical dialogue and her narrative dexterity often conceal tragic depths, as in the superb ‘The Dying Room’. Widely anthologized herself, Hammick has also edited an anthology, The Virago Book of Love and Loss (1992), which includes a number of influences and affinities—Elizabeth Bowen, Sylvia Townsend Warner, Elizabeth Taylor, Alice Munro.
