Kicking the Tires is Just the Beginning. Here are some Helpful Tips to get You Started Before Your Test Drive: Before you buy a used car, verify the reading on the odometer. Check the windows, door locks and seat adjustments. Check the headlights, brake lights and turn indicators. Check for rust behind the bumpers and around the rocker panels below the doors. When you decide on the used car you want to buy, be sure to have it checked out by a certified mechanic at AAA Approved Auto Repair facility.
