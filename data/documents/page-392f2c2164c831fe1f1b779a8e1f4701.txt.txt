Blondes Jokes You're here &raquo; Jokes &raquo; Blondes Jokes &raquo; Selling a Car Category: Clean Blondes Jokes Clean Christian jokes, funny jokes, free jokes, and clean jokes and humor about blondes with my apologies to blondes everywhere. Selling a Car blonde tried to sell her old car. She was having a lot of problems selling it, because the car had 250,000 miles on it. One day, she told her problem to a friend she worked with at a salon. Her friend told her, &quot;There is a possibility to make the car easier to sell, but it's not legal.&quot; &quot;That doesn't matter,&quot; replied the blonde, &quot;if only I can sell the car.&quot; &quot;Okay,&quot; said the blonde's friend. &quot;Here is the address of a friend of mine. He owns a car repair shop. Tell him I sent you and he will turn the counter in your car back to 50,000 miles. Then it should not be a problem to sell your car anymore.&quot; The following weekend, the blonde made the trip to the mechanic. About one month after that, the friend asked her, &quot;Did you sell your car?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; replied the blonde, &quot;why should I? It only has 50,000 miles on it!&quot; Previous Blondes Joke | Blondes Index | Next Blondes Joke Choose another category Like This Page?
