Representing the fourth generation of BMW&#8217;s premium mid-sizecoupé, the new BMW 4 Series embodies the sporty nature of this segment inevery aspect of its design, performance and dynamics. According to Phil Horton, managing director of BMW Group Australia, the&#8216;4&#8217; in the model designation signals the outstanding stylingand premium positioning of the new model. &#8220;The all-new BMW 4 Series Coupé is, quite simply, a beautifulvehicle. It&#8217;s obvious from the first glance that this new coupépossesses the dynamic styling and elegant design worthy of a new BMWSeries,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The all-new 4 Series also represents an increase in exclusivitythat is reflected in its very high level of standard equipment andinnovative cutting edge technology,&#8221; said Horton. The BMW 4 Series Coupé sets itself apart from its predecessor in everyaspect, sporting a clearly more dynamic and muscular design language,substantial technical differentiation and a host of innovative newfeatures. Although displaying a distinct kinship with the BMW 3 Series, the newBMW 4 Series Coupé&#8217;s more muscular and purposeful design highlightsits dynamic abilities. Exterior features have been designed to highlightthe vehicle&#8217;s sporty pedigree, starting with a large, wide air-intakein the front apron which accentuates the vehicle&#8217;s increased width.The air-intake is capped at both ends by apertures for aerodynamicallymotivated air-curtains which are complimented by air-breathers located justbehind the front wheels. The BMW 4 Series Coupé&#8217;s gently sloping roofline displays atypically elegant silhouette. Below the windows, a prominent double swageline visually reduces over the rear wheels to accentuate flared arches,which now represent the widest part of the car. Further horizontal linescombine with L-shaped tail lights to further reinforce the coupé&#8217;spowerfully wide stance from the rear. The new BMW 4 Series Coupé has grown proportionally in comparison to theout-going model. The overall length has increased by 26 mm to 4,638 mm,width has increased by 43 mm to 1,825 mm and height has decreased by 16 mmto 1,362 mm &#8211; and these dimensions all combine to enhance thevehicle&#8217;s sportier credentials. While the BMW 4 Series Coupé&#8217;s chassis is based on the latest 3Series sedan, some significant changes have been made to promise a higherlevel of accuracy and agility. The chassis has been significantly extended,with 50 mm added to the wheel base and substantial increases to the trackwidth - 45 mm extra at the front and a full 80 mm at the rear. Refinements have also been made to the suspension of the vehicle,including fine-tuning of the springs and damping, axle kinematics andelastokinematics, as well as providing additional strengthening elements inthe front section of the car. Powered by the latest in engine technology, the new BMW 4 Series Coupémodels are all equipped with BMW TwinPower turbo engines boastingexhilarating power and torque figures, yet still returning impressive fueleconomy. At the entry point to the range, the 420d Coupé is equipped with a BMWTwinPower turbo four-cylinder diesel engine producing 135kW of power and380 Nm of torque. The 420d accelerates to 100km/h in 7.3 seconds and boastsa staggeringly low fuel consumption figure of 4.6 l/100km, with emissionsof just 121 grams of CO2 per km. The 428i Coupé features the multi-award winning TwinPower turbofour-cylinder petrol engine, developing 180 kW of power and 350 Nm oftorque. This output is enough to nail the 0-100 km/h sprint in just 5.8seconds while consuming a low 6.4 l/100 km of fuel on the combinedcycle. At the top of the range, the prodigious thrust of the 435i Coupé isprovided by the much lauded BMW TwinPower turbo in-line six-cylinder petrolengine which pumps out 225 kW and 400 Nm of torque. Reaching 100 km/h injust 5.1 seconds, the performance belies the conscientiously frugal fuelconsumption and emissions figures of just 7.4 l/100km and 171 g/km of CO2respectively. These impressive results are achieved in part due to the standardinclusion of the eight-speed Sports Automatic transmission for all BMW 4Series Coupé models. Additionally, all three models combine ultra-efficient engine andtransmission combinations with a suite of BMW EfficientDynamicstechnologies to achieve exemplary consumption and emissions figures. EachBMW 4 Series Coupé is equipped with Auto Stop/Start, Brake EnergyRegeneration, ECO PRO mode and on-demand ancillaries such as electric powersteering.
