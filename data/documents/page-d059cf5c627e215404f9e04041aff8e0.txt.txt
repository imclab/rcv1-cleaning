DeGeneres to host Oscars for second time View Photo Gallery &mdash; Oscar hosts through the years:&thinsp;Ellen DeGeneres will take on the high-profile role in 2014 of hosting the Academy Awards. Here&rsquo;s a look at other hosts.  By Emily Yahr ,&#32; E-mail the writer So long, Seth MacFarlane. A year after the &ldquo;Family Guy&rdquo; creator&rsquo;s crude brand of humor drew widespread criticism, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided to go with a much safer name to host next year&rsquo;s Oscars telecast &mdash; daytime talk-show favorite Ellen DeGeneres .

During this spring&rsquo;s ceremony, MacFarlane described &ldquo;Django Unchained&rdquo; as &ldquo;the story of a man fighting to get back his woman, who&rsquo;s been subjected to unspeakable violence &mdash; or, as Chris Brown and Rihanna call it, a date movie.&rdquo; He also put on an elaborate chorus number about actresses in nude scenes, titled &ldquo;We Saw Your Boobs.&rdquo; DeGeneres also breaks the cycle of three years of headline-making host choices, starting with the unfortunate pairing in 2011 of James Franco and Anne Hathaway. The next year, producer Brett Ratner stepped down after a fury over homophobic comments he made, with his host, Eddie Murphy, abruptly quitting, as well. &ldquo;I think this year there really may have been a desire not to make an inflammatory choice and to let the news about the Oscars be the movies,&rdquo; said Mark Harris, author of &ldquo;Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood,&rdquo; who covers the Oscars for Grantland.com. Plus, having a female host could make up for the thrashing that MacFarlane received for his jokes about women in Hollywood (&ldquo;Lot of beautiful women here tonight. And for those of you who gave themselves the flu two weeks ago to &lsquo;get there,&rsquo; it paid off.&rdquo;), which many derided as misogynistic . &ldquo;I would really not underestimate the degree to which the academy took seriously the backlash to MacFarlane from women last year,&rdquo; Harris said. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t just bloggers or journalists, it was a number of women in the industry who publicly said, &lsquo;I have a problem with the movie year being represented by this tone.&rsquo; .&thinsp;.&thinsp;. [The academy] really listens to that kind of stuff.&rdquo; The MacFarlane-led broadcast didn&rsquo;t hurt for ratings despite (or perhaps because of) the controversy: About 40million people tuned in to that ceremony, in which &ldquo;Argo&rdquo; won best picture, making it the most-watched entertainment program in almost three years. When DeGeneres hosted, the same number watched &ldquo;The Departed&rdquo; take home the top prize. Given the viewers, some don&rsquo;t think the academy, or ABC, which broadcasts the show, would deem MacFarlane a &ldquo;failure.&rdquo; But the executives are probably eager for the &ldquo;comfortable but fun&rdquo; choice of DeGeneres, said Dave Karger, chief correspondent for Fandango, because the show can easily capi&shy;tal&shy;ize on her huge following on TV and Twitter. And the diversity factor is always crucial. &ldquo;I think the fact that you have an openly gay host this year, it&rsquo;s really keeping with what is shaping up to be a very diverse list of potential nominees this year,&rdquo; said Karger, pointing to an &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; number of African American potential best actor nominees, including Forest Whitaker in &ldquo; The Butler &rdquo; and Michael B. Jordan in &ldquo; Fruitvale Station .&rdquo; The Oscars, airing March 2 on ABC, will be produced for the second year in a row by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron (the minds behind NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Smash&rdquo; ), who will have to brainstorm new ways to make headlines with a much safer host. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe to say Ellen DeGeneres won&rsquo;t be singing, &lsquo;We Saw Your Boobs,&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo; Karger said.
