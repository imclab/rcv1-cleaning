Up until The Revolutionin 1960, Cuba was the largest importer of American Cars, mostly thehuge, gas-guzzling, multi-ton pile of metal that so many of us lookback on today as a romantic relic of the past. After the embargo, Cubahas had cars from other countries&#151;most notably, Russia&#151;but fewof them have ever been able to last but a few years. The American cars,however, have lasted through the years, and still run perfectly today.For most Cubans, this is their main source of revenue, since they canoperate a taxicab, taking tourists around, and taking in up to $50/dayin an economy where the average Cuban makes $15-25 a month. Of course,the cost of owning a car is high, especially with gasoline costing$8/gallon. But, with prices this high, it's not surprising to see abeautify gas station with a mini-mart and fresh, clean paint on thewalls, popping out conspicuously from a scene of intense poverty alongrural roads.  cars-f mid-40s Fleetline, Chevrolet cars-k  The Camel The "Camel", as it is called, because of the two "humps" that are onthe front and back, is an enormous people-moving vehicle that cancarry more Cubans than the entire Cuban Population of the state of Florida.Built out of 18-wheeler semi's, normally used to haul earth-moving equipmentor actors from the World Wrestling Federation, these trucks pack peopleso tightly, explains one old woman, that "people have done everythingbiologically possible that a human can do." cars-i Now, here is where Cuban ingenuity and sense of humor combineto not only solve problems, but do it with a smile. The Coconut Taxi,or the "coco-taxi", is a cute little two-seater, which is mostly used todo quick trips around the city, or to be used as a wedding limo to takeyou to... well, back home. And, despite the obvious visual conclusionsyou may draw, not one has been seen on a golf course. (Well, Cubansunderstandably don't have a lot of Republicans, so golf hashad limited exposure on this tiny island.)  cars-o Waiting for a Fare The Happy Couple  Coco (4) Coco (1) Coco (2)  Coco (3) Coco Cab Caravan  Dad's new Car cars-p  Residential Neighborhood cars-m  Newly Weds Speedy Gonzalas  52 Chevrolet cars-u Nike Volkswagon  cars-v cars-w  cars-x cars-y  cars-z cars-s  Black Pontiac Black Chevy (2)  1956 Black Chevy Blue (7)  Blue Engines Blue Streak  Bmw Buick Dreamin  Car and Building  Dan Jill Car Gangster Car (1)  Red Truck (2) Green (1)  Green (2) Green (3)  Green (4) Grey Park Stumpy  Havana Cruising Hearse  Nite Taxi Driver Orange Car  Red Blue Yellow Red Car Jill  Red Grille (1) Red Grille (2)  Red and White Red Speedy (1)  Red Speedy (2) Red Truck (1)  Renault 4cv Wedding Limo  White Car and Arch Car Maintenance  Yellow Chevy (2) Yellow Chevy (3)  Yellow Chevy (5) Yellow Chevy (1) Click to recommend this page:  Photography Books by Dan Heller Travel Photography Guide to Model Releases Order Now!
