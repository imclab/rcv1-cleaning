 EntertainmenToday All the Juice on Hollywood and Entertainment Home Privacy Page  CLOUD ATLAS Original Soundtrack Now Available at Digital Retailers Published October 23, 2012 | By KaliUmanti WaterTower Music will release the CLOUD ATLAS: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack at all digital retailers on October 23, with a physical CD release to follow on November 6. The original music was composed by Tom Tykwer, Johnny Klimek, and Reinhold Heil. Tykwer also shares screenwriting and directing credits with filmmakers Lana Wachowski and Andy Wachowski, in bringing David Mitchell&rsquo;s best-selling novel to the big screen in the October 26th release Cloud Atlas. Music is a central part of the Cloud Atlas story, particularly in one sequence of the film&rsquo;s narrative involving a young composer who struggles to complete his life&rsquo;s work, entitled The Cloud Atlas Sextet. This musical theme then recurrs throughout the film and helps to connect multiple threads of action together as a single story moving through time. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ever-present melody from a simple string line to a riff in a 1970s rock piece, to a jazz sextet playing in the background at the Cavendish party. We needed something beautiful and malleable enough to take us through five centuries,&rdquo; said Tykwer. &ldquo;There are lots of subjective voices in the story, and we were searching for one voice that could encompass them all, to form a beautiful choir.&rdquo; Because of this the three composers began working on the music before a single frame of film was shot. &ldquo;He prefers this to using temporary music by other composers,&rdquo; Heil explained. &ldquo;It allows him to use the temp score without worrying about what will take its place. As the film takes shape in post-production, we see what&rsquo;s missing or needs changing and re-record the final.&rdquo; In the powerful and inspiring epic Cloud Atlas, drama, mystery, action and enduring love thread through a single story that unfolds in multiple timelines over the span of 500 years. Characters meet and reunite from one life to the next. Born and reborn. As the consequences of their actions and choices impact one another through the past, the present and the distant future, one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and a single act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution. Everything is connected. Academy Award&reg; winners Tom Hanks (Philadelphia, Forrest Gump) and Halle Berry (Monster&rsquo;s Ball) lead a stellar international cast that also includes Oscar&reg; winner Jim Broadbent (Iris), Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, James D&rsquo;Arcy, Xun Zhou, Keith David and David Gyasi, with Oscar&reg; winner Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking) and Hugh Grant. Each member of the ensemble appears in multiple roles as the story moves through time. Cloud Atlas is produced by Grant Hill, Stefan Arndt, Lana Wachowski, Tom Tykwer and Andy Wachowski, with executive producers Philip Lee, Uwe Schott and Wilson Qui. The Cloud Atlas &#8212; Original Motion Picture Soundtrack on WaterTower Music will be available digitally on October 23, and as a physical CD November 6, 2012. For more information on CLOUD ATLAS please visit: http://cloudatlas.warnerbros.com/ ABOUT THE COMPOSERS Tom Tykwer is one of Germany&rsquo;s most exciting filmmakers and a triple threat (writer, director, composer). In 1999, he made his international breakthrough with the adrenaline-fuelled Run Lola Run, which, as well as directing, he also wrote and co-composed with Klimek and Heil. The film was both a commercial and critical success, going on to become the most successful German film of that year. He followed this with The Princess and the Warrior, and then with his first English-language film, Heaven. In 2006, Tykwer co-wrote and directed Perfume: The Story of a Murderer. His next film was the sleek thriller The International. Most recently he completed the German language film 3 (Drei). Reinhold Heil was born in a small town in West Germany and trained to become a classical pianist. While studying at the Berlin Music Academy, Heil became Nina Hagen&rsquo;s keyboardist, co-writer, and co-producer and for the next few years honed his craft in what became the legendary Nina Hagen Band. After Hagen left the group, the remaining band members formed Spliff, one of Germany&rsquo;s most successful rock bands of the 1980s. Born in Australia, Johnny Klimek paid his dues in a series of gritty pub bands before migrating to Berlin to form the &lsquo;80s pop ensemble &ldquo;The Other Ones&rdquo; with his siblings. He segued into the club music scene on his own in the &rsquo;90s, and, out of the latter emerged his creative marriages to both Heil and Tykwer. Among Klimek and Heil&rsquo;s credits are Killer Elite, the TV series Awake, One Hour Photo, the acclaimed TV series Deadwood, and the theme song for Without a Trace. Up next for the duo is I, Frankenstein, starring Bill Nighy and Aaron Eckhart, slated for release in February.

The &#8220;Les Misérables&#8221; star wore a black and white patterned dress and a beige fur-lined jacket as she clung tight to her hubby who wore a white shirt, black jacket, and blue jeans. After their sunset ceremony in Big Sur, California on September 29th, the happy couple were off to London for a vegetarian meal at Mildred&#8217;s before heading to a showing of &#8220;Moonrise Kingdom.&#8221; Their London stop was brief, as they then caught a train to Paris where they began a romantic drive all the way down to Morocco. However, the European adventure wasn&#8217;t the original plan. The 29-year-old actress and her man initially planned on visiting Thailand, but according to an Us Weekly source, the weather was &#8220;not to their liking, so they switched to Europe.&#8221; Read it Here: Celebrity Scandals: Gossip Center Posted in Celebrities | Tagged Adam , Anne , Hathaway , PostHoneymoon , Shulman's , Travels | Leave a comment Atlanta Housewives Are Back: Bigger, Badder &amp; Bitchier Than Ever!

In a new blog for I Love You Magazine , 22-year-old Karolin Wolter shares horrifying details about the pressures put on her to get dangerously thin during her years as a model, and how she attempted to transition into the world of plus-sized modeling to escape the danger to her mental and physical health. PHOTOS: Plus-Size Models Show Us How It&#8217;s Done Wolter, who has posed for everyone from Marc Jacobs to Yves Saint Laurent, was 137 pounds before she got into modeling, dropping down to 126 when she first signed with her agency in 2008, but people were still telling her that she had to lose weight. “During my first fashion week in February 2009 I was 53-55kg (117-121 lbs) — almost 10kg (22 lbs) under my natural body weight,” she reveals. “I did well, I did really well, but even then my agents were telling me ‘You know Karolin, next season are the spring/summer shows, you have to be even skinnier.&#8217;&#8221; PHOTOS: The Hottest Supermodels Strip Down Though she was thinner than ever, her self-esteem was at an all time low. “In those days I rarely, if ever, had the feeling that anyone in the industry actually thought I was perfect the way I was. I am not surprised it completely f***ed with my mind.” PHOTOS: Skin And Bones Model Causes Controversy In Milan The pressure started mounting and taking a toll on her health. “My natural eating behavior disappeared entirely. I didn’t know if I was hungry or what I was hungry for. Every time I looked in the mirror I had this feeling of not being the way I was supposed to be. Every day the burden became heavier.” PHOTOS: Plus Size Model Robyn Lawley Strips Down Into A Sexy Bikini Finally, Wolter was forced to quit the industry when she “couldn’t look in the mirror anymore.” After spending a few months hiking in the Alps alone and taking an apartment in Berlin, she decided to return to the modeling industry, but promoting only her real measurements. She also suggested to her agent that she could be a plus-size model, but despite telling her she wasn’t big enough, plus-size agents in New York were happy to take her in, though internationally she was still booked as “straight size.” PHOTOS: When Skinny Isn&#8217;t Sexy! 10 Stars Who Have Lost Too Much Weight She admits that this was a mistake, as she had trouble booking gigs in the plus-size industry because she needed to wear pads to look bigger, and her agents in Europe had trouble booking her because everyone thought she was too big because of her hype as a “plus-size model.” Now back to her “straight size” status, she admits that she enjoyed her time in the plus-size world. PHOTOS: The 10 Highest Paid Supermodels In The World “I was proud — I actually loved being called plus-size. I told everyone I was plus-size. I love the words ‘plus-size.’ To be given this label was most likely the happiest day I can remember.” RELATED STORIES: Plus-Size Model Slams Designers Who &#8216;Tell Girls To Lose Weight&#8217; Plus-Size Model Opens Up About Pressure To Be Thin, &#8216;Heroin Chic Look Isn&#8217;t My Cup Of Tea&#8217; &#8217;80-Pound&#8217; Actress Antonia Campbell-Hughes Is A &#8216;Walking Skeleton&#8217; On The Red Carpet Muscled No More!

Confronting a rumor he&#8217;d heard amidst the back-and-forth with Berry, Leno asked her if she&#8217;d ever smoked pot with Hanks. Playfully calling Jay out on his own smoking past, Berry shot back, “I did. I smoked pot with Tom Hanks in this movie,” which was later referred to as “movie pot.” Described as “an exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution,” “Cloud Atlas” is set to hit theaters on October 26th.

PHOTOS: Celebs Who Died Young The cause of Scott’s death was determined as “multiple blunt force injuries” and drowning was also considered to be a factor.
