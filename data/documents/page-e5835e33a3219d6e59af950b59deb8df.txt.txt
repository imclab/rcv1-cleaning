THOMPSON / For the Lincoln Journal Star JournalStar.com April 08, 2011 10:45 pm &bull; By PAMELA S. THOMPSON / For the Lincoln Journal Star (0) Comments If you go What: "Forbidden Broadway" Read more Anyone who sings show tunes in the shower and delights inpiercing the pretensions of the Great White Way will take a specialpleasure in "Forbidden Broadway's Greatest Hits: Vol. 1" at theLincoln Community Playhouse. The zany musical revue that debuted nearly 30 years ago spoofsBroadway's biggest shows and bigger stars. Created and written byGerard Alessandrini, this long-running off-Broadway hit cleverlyweaves real Broadway lyrics with parody lyrics as it lampoons suchshows as "Les Miserables," "Wicked," "Hairspray," "Chicago," "Rent"and "Mamma Mia." Performed on a bare stage in the studio theater, the nine castmembers change costumes as often as they change keys. The actorsrange from stage veteran Danny Johnson to LCP first-timers RachelDanay and Sydney Ray. Mary Bolin, Bruce Hahn, Dustin Hayes, AmberNore, Lisa Steiner and Lisa A. Taylor round out the ensemble. It must be said that vocal pyrotechnics are not the strength ofthis show. In a number of cases, the voices are not equal to thematerial. But insofar as this is a show about heart and humor, thecommitment to the comedy carries the evening. Johnson's mockery of Broadway legend Mandy Patinkin is a joy, asis Steiner's version of an anthem from "Wicked." Ray shines in anumber sung to her cellphone, as does the quartet that satirizesthemes from "Fiddler on the Roof." "Forbidden Broadway" is directed by Morrie Enders, with JanMalone as music director, Michelle Lee Robison as stage manager,Alyssa Fiala as costume designer, Aaron Wong as lighting designerand Nick Turner as technical director. For those who love musical theater but can enjoy a joke at itsexpense, this show rewards that affection. Tags Forbidden Broadway , Musical , Revue View (0) Comments No Comments Posted.
