The funniest young comic I’ve seen in years.” – Chris Rock           Chicago-bred New York-based stand-up comedian Hannibal Buress established himself as a master of “comedic jokes related to personal stories, current events, the streets, and even food” (yes, someone actually wrote and published that line) in ANIMAL FURNACE, his COMEDY CENTRAL original one-hour stand-up special that premiered May 20, 2012. Hannibal Buress has appeared on THE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN, LATE NIGHT WITH JIMMY FALLON, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!, THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH CRAIG FERGUSON, and CONAN. He can be seen on 30 ROCK, LOUIE, and as the co-host of the Adult Swim series THE ERIC ANDRE SHOW. Buress has previously worked on the writing staffs of 30 ROCK and SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE and was recently awarded the American Comedy Award for Best Club Comic of 2012. Though perpetually touring, Buress considers New York City, where he hosts a weekly Sunday comedy night at Brooklyn’s Knitting Factory, to be his place of residence. He lives with zero pets and an XBOX 360, and has a cable package with the Starz network but never watches it.
