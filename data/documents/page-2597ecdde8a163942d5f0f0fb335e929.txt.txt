Since the front clip was still assembled, we fit it to the body.   We removed thick body filler from the deck lid by warming it with torch and scraping. The body panels were media blasted to remove the bad paint and show the true car we would be dealing with: Small rust holes and over-worked quarter panels were revealed.   Fenders, hood and small body parts were stripped and found to be in fair condition.      The rear trunk sill and tail light panels were fitted before removing the rear quarters to give reference for welding-in  the new quarter panels. At this time no one is reproducing convertible quarter panel sheetmetal, but Dynacorn's hardtop panels can be trimmed to fit, as we have done to this car.   All panels test fit... Check Rusty sheetmetal replaced... Check Right side body work roughed-in... Check Now, the owner's son will take the car to finish the body work and paint. * If your project is stuck because you need someone to replace your rusted metal, let us help you out. We have experienced craftsmen and the proper equipment to get your project back on track!      Copyright &copy; 2009 Premium Auto Restoration of Derby Kansas |920 N River St &#8226; Derby, KS 67037|Tel: (316) 788-3330| Contact Us |
