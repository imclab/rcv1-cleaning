Robinson Jr. Theater. The Center serves a dual purpose: to enhance the academic programs on campus and to complement the cultural offerings within Jacksonville. Both short and long term artist residencies engage students at UNF across colleges and disciplines and provide opportunities for in-classroom interaction. We host an eclectic mix of world-class performers, entertainers, ethnic music and dance, cutting-edge performances, and children’s programming. The Center is a vibrant community of artists, students and audiences with events spanning all performing arts disciplines, workshops, lectures, corporate training seminars, social events and receptions.     U P C O M I N G   E V E N T S   A T   T H E   F I N E   A R T S   C E N T E R                              UNF Department of Music           UNF Department of Art &amp; Design           UNF Gallery of Art           Lufrano Intercultural Gallery           MOCA Jacksonville          Copyright © 2012 University of North Florida 1 UNF Drive&#160;| Jacksonville, FL 32224 |&#160;Phone: (904) 620-1000 Contact   | Emergency | Privacy | Regulations Disability Accommodations
