July 13, 2013 / 11 am to 7 pm, Sun. July 14, 2013 / noon to 5 pm  Rain or Shine, Free Admission and Free Parking! Haddonfield celebrates its Tricentennial. Throughout 2013, Haddonfield and its community will commemorate the 300th anniversary of the borough's settlement in 1713. Haddonfield has grown into a thriving small town renowned for its ideal location and quaint shopping, dining, and business district. The town is also known for its largest annual festival, the Haddonfield Crafts and Fine Art Festival, which returns for its 21st year, Sat., July 13, 11 a.m. - 7 p.m. and Sun., July 14, noon - 5 p.m. The two-day outdoor festival garners national attention and attracts crowds of more than 100,000 people. Artisans will exhibit a wide range of arts and crafts, including ceramics, glass, jewelry, wood, fiber, metal, paper, drawings, paintings, photography, and wearable art. Appreciate three centuries of local history as many crafters utilize methods more than 300 years old, like pottery, watercolor, crochet, woodworking, and basket weaving. What is a usually a busy main artery through the center of town is transformed into a festive corridor, alive with a panorama of artists' tents, outdoor cafes, musicians, and more. The nationally ranked festival is not only the area's largest family-friendly event, it draws family-run craft businesses from across the country. The festival is located along Kings Highway between Washington Ave. and Haddon Ave. and along Tanner St .to Euclid Ave. This free event is easily accessible from area bridges or by taking the PATCO Speedline to the heart of the shopping district. Parking is also free during the two-day festival. _____________________________ Back to Top ________________________________ Sponsors  _____________________________ Back to Top ________________________________ Artwork Photography: Steve Miller  Isabelle Davidowitz, Isabelle Glass Bryan Sculthorpe, Yardsale Press  Petra Rowland, Cutlery Couture Jewelry: Kathleen Bennethum Michelle Cole, Cole-odion Studio Pottery: Ingrid Jordan Wine Barrel Designs _____________________________ Back to Top ________________________________ Festival Photos  _____________________________ Back to Top ____________________________________  Can't find something?
