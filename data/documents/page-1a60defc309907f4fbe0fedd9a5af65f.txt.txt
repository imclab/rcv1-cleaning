Humor never in doubt with Durang BY HERB HAMMER chagrinvalleytimes.com  |  0comments  THEATER Christopher Durang has been making fun of some very successful playwrights for a couple of decades. He claims to have written well over 100 short plays. Mr. Durang claims a lot of things. One thing is sure -- he is a very funny man. His parodies, spoofs and send-ups have been making audiences laugh outloud for a long time.   kAm%96 r928C:?
