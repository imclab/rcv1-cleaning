  Kia to Unveil Crossover Concept, Superman Car at 2013 Chicago Auto Show Kia&#39;s showing in Chicago next week will be a mix of concept, in the Kia Cross GT, and just plain conceptual, in its Superman-inspired Optima Hybrid . Both cars are set to be unveiled at the 2013 Chicago Auto Show, which runs Feb. 9-18 at McCormick Place. Kia released a sneak peak of the Cross GT concept this morning. The photo shows what appears to be a seven-seat crossover larger than the 2014 Kia Sorento . Kia describes the Cross GT concept as &quot;inspired by nature, driven by technology&quot; and stated that it &quot;hints at the future of Kia’s design language in the form of a premium Crossover Utility Vehicle.&quot; We’ll have full coverage of the concept next week from the show. Although the Man of Steel&#39;s abilities to go faster than a speeding bullet and leap tall buildings in a single bound mean he won&#39;t need a ride to the auto show, that hasn&#39;t stopped Kia and DC Entertainment from joining forces to create a suped -up vehicle in Superman&#39;s honor. The teaser photo of the Superman Optima Hybrid shows it wearing the superhero&#39;s signature red and blue, with his red-and-yellow &quot;S&quot; shield on the hood; and the red-tinted headlights look like they could be giving off the superhero&#39;s heat vision. With the addition of the Superman Optima Hybrid, the parking lot at the Justice League&#39;s Hall of Justice is filling up fast. The car is the sixth in a series of Kia vehicles customized for each member of DC&#39;s superhero coalition, the Justice League. The others, which appeared together at the 2012 Specialty Equipment Market Association Show in Las Vegas, include a Batman-inspired Optima , a Forte Koup for The Flash, an Aquaman Rio hatchback, a Green Lantern Soul and a Forte hatch for Cyborg. According to Kia and DC, the Justice League line will include seven character cars — that likely leaves Wonder Woman as the remaining member to be represented — with an eighth and final car incorporating the entire team.

If this is a serious marketing concept then I&#39;m definitely in and would consider either a Batman inspired Optima or the Flash version of the Forte Kohl. I, too, am in love.
