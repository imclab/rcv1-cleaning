They are especially useful for big babies who have outgrown their infant only seat, but still need to be rear-facing until they are two years old. Convertible Seats When Used Rear Facing : According to the latest car seat guidelines , infants and toddlers should ride in a rear-facing car seat (infant-only rear facing car seat or rear-facing convertible car seat) until they are two years old or until they have reached the weight and height limits of their car seat. If a younger infant or toddler meets the weight or height limits of an infant only seat before age two years, it is likely safest to move the child into a convertible seat which is recommended for a child up to 35-40 pounds in the rear-facing position. This seat is also placed rear-facing. Harness straps should be at or below infant's shoulders when used rear facing. Harness chest clip should be at infant&#8217;s armpit level. Convertible Seats When Used Forward Facing : All are rated for children up to 40 pounds, although some newer convertible seats have higher 65 to 80 pound weight limits. Once children are two years old (or, regardless of age, have outgrown their rear-facing car seat) children should sit in a forward-facing car seat with harness straps as long as possible and until they reach the weight and height limits of their car seat. Harness straps should be at or above child's shoulders. Use top harness slots of safety seat. Harness chest clip should be at child&#8217;s armpit level.
