At the 62-year-old singer-songwriter&#39;s hospital bedside Saturday, according to the Sun newspaper, were his wife, daughter and two sons, plus his brother Barry Gibb, who&#39;d famously been with Robin and Maurice Gibb in the Grammy-winning Bee Gees. “Our prayers are with Robin,&quot; a family friend told the Sun . &quot;He has kept so positive and always believed he could beat this.&quot; Though the paper reported the coma and possibly a second tumor, publicist Doug Wright has given no details beyond saying Gibb was hospitalized in stable condition. PHOTOS: Robin Gibb Gibb as recently as February was reveling in what he called a &quot;spectacular&quot; recovery after having a growth removed from his colon and undergoing chemotherapy. Though it has been reported that he was battling cancer, and that it involved his liver as well, Gibb has not confirmed that publicly. He had intestinal surgery last month, and was hospitalized late last year for stomach and colon problems. In 2010, Robin had surgery for a twisted small intestine, repairing the same congenital condition that had resulted in the death at age 53 of his twin brother Maurice. &quot;He sends all his love,&quot; Robin-John said ahead of the performance his father missed on Tuesday. &quot;We are all praying for him and hoping he has a speedy recovery.&quot; &quot;The Titanic Requiem,&quot; which Robin Gibb composed with son Robin-John to comemmorate the 100th anniversary of the legendary ship&#39;s sinking on April 15, 1912, is a far cry from the disco-era hits that brought the Bee Gees to fame in the 1970s. Hear a taste of the non-disco side of Robin Gibb, below. &quot;It&#39;s a serious subject and it’s not a rock opera,&quot; he said in a recent interview . &quot;There are no backbeats. This could have been written 300 years ago.&quot; &#0160; RELATED: Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees reportedly fighting cancer Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees hospitalized for intestinal surgery Robin Gibb announces &#39;spectacular&#39; recovery after growth removed from colon — Christie D&#39;Zurilla Twitter.com/dzurillaville Christie D&#39;Zurilla on Google+ The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Gibb, whose twin brother Maurice died at 53 of twisted intestine caused by a congenital defect shared by Robin, announced in February that a growth on his colon had been removed and his health was looking up. On Wednesday, however, his publicist said the 62-year-old singer and songwriter was recovering in the hospital after intestinal surgery Sunday and had been forced to cancel a number of commitments. Still on the schedule, at least for now, is Gibb&#39;s classical music concert debut in April. He&#39;ll lead a performance of &quot;The Titanic Requiem,&quot; a new work composed by him and his son, RJ, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the ship&#39;s sinking. The illness, widely reported to be cancer, has dogged the onetime Bee Gees member and required chemotherapy as recently as January, his spokesman told the BBC at the time. &quot;It&#39;s all simple,&quot; Gibb told BBC Radio 2 back in February. &quot;I was diagnosed with a growth in my colon. It was removed. And I&#39;ve been treated for that by a brilliant doctor, and in their own words &#39;the results have been spectacular.&#39; &quot; Gibb had been reveling in the notion of gaining some weight. &quot;I love food, I love eating,&quot; he told the BBC, adding: &quot;I&#39;ve always been thin. If you go back to when we first started I&#39;ve always been skinny. It&#39;s hard for me to put on weight.&quot; RELATED: Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees is fighting cancer Robin Gibb announces &#39;spectacular&#39; recovery from colon cancer George Michael reschedules shows canceled during pneumonia scare — Christie D&#39;Zurilla Twitter.com/dzurillaville Christie D&#39;Zurilla on Google+ The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Currently, the onetime glamour girl&#39;s affairs are tended to by her husband, Frederic Von Anhalt, who for years has been at odds with his wife&#39;s daughter, Constance Francesca Gabor Hilton. &quot;What Ms. Hilton is seeking here is for the court to make sure that Zsa Zsa’s best interests are not being sacrificed for the selfish interests of anyone involved in Zsa Zsa’s life,&quot; her attorney Kenneth W. Kossoff said Tuesday in a statement. TIMELINE: The love life of Zsa Zsa Gabor &quot;Having the court supervise Zsa Zsa&#39;s care and finances will serve to ensure that Zsa Zsa&#39;s interests are being protected by whoever is in charge of her person and estate –- whether Ms. Hilton, von Anhalt or an independent third party appointed by the court,&quot; Kossoff said. According to a statement released by Hilton&#39;s rep, she has been waiting for more than a year for reports pertaining to her mother&#39;s physical and financial health, hoping Van Anhalt &quot;had Zsa Zsa’s interests at heart.&quot; However, &quot;having just recently learned that he took out a $700,000 loan, and that there was a notice of default recorded against the property in late February 2012 because he apparently has not been paying Zsa Zsa’s mortgage payment, it became clear to Francesca that if she did not seek to protect her mother, no one else would.&quot; Von Anhalt recently made headlines when he threw a 95th birthday party for his ailing wife, whose health has been in decline in recent years, especially since a July 2010 fall from bed in which she broke her right hip; after a hip replacement, that injury ultimately resulted in partial amputation of her right leg. &quot;He&#39;s basically taken my mother away from me,&quot; Hilton told CNN last year. Von Anhalt is Gabor&#39;s ninth husband.

Michael revealed in December that he&#39;d been near death for several weeks after falling ill in November, and on Tuesday he once again expressed his gratitude. &quot;I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you first to the doctors and nurses who saved my life and took such great care of me and to all my fans, family and friends for their love and support,&quot; the singer said on his official website . &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to seeing everyone.&quot; Michael was so thankful, as a matter of fact, that he donated 1,000 tickets to the medical staff at AKH Hospital for the Sept. 4 kickoff show -- an addition to the tour -- in Vienna, Austria. He&#39;ll also hit dates in the Netherlands and France before returning to Britain for shows in Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, Newcastle, Cardiff and Liverpool, ending with three nights in London in October.

The 65-year-old prop comic Gallagher was put into the coma after suffering a heart attack Wednesday that required him to have two stents replaced. All signs are good, Christine Sherrer told the Huffington Post on Thursday afternoon, explaining that her client would be slowly awakened over the course of 24 hours or so. The heart attack came Wednesday while Gallagher was in the green room about 20 minutes before a 9 p.m. show, after doing a meet-and-greet with fans in Lewisville, Texas, outside of Dallas. Gallagher collapsed last year on stage after suffering a minor heart attack while smashing stuff during a show in Minnesota. The comic, whose full name is Leo Anthony Gallagher, also ran for governor of California in the 2003 recall election, finishing 16th out of 135 candidates.

His promotional manager Christine Scherrer said the 65-year-old prop comic, known for smashing watermelons and whatnot on stage with the &quot; Sledge-o-Matic ,&quot; was sedated and stable in the Dallas area, telling CNN on Thursday, &quot;We will not know the outcome until sometime tomorrow.&quot; Before paramedics arrived, CPR was performed on Gallagher by an employee of the club, Coach Joe&#39;s Hat Tricks in Lewisville, manager Marc Cummins told the Associated Press.&#0160; The comic collapsed last year while smashing stuff during a show in Minnesota; the incident was later determined to be caused by a heart attack, Us Weekly said.

Symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.) Cannon, who quit his daily morning radio show last month, says he&#39;s now trying to get six hours of sleep a night and is taking it easy at home.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; At the end of January, the father of twins and &quot;America&#39;s Got Talent&quot; host posted the video below on his personal website , explaining what he&#39;d been through during the Christmas holidays and up to that point. In mid-February, he was hospitalized again but managed to keep the situation quiet until he was back home. &#0160; RELATED: Nick Cannon: New health concerns take him off morning radio show Nick Cannon hospitalized for kidney issues after family&#39;s Aspen holiday Nick Cannon has &quot;good prognosis,&quot; may be home soon, wife Mariah Carey says -- Christie D&#39;Zurilla twitter.com/dzurillaville Christie D&#39;Zurilla on Google+ Photo: Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon and their son Moroccan at the BET Honors in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 14.

Dench, 77, revealed her condition Saturday to the Daily Mirror. &quot;I can’t read scripts anymore because of the trouble with my eyes. And so somebody comes in and reads them to me, like telling me a story,&quot; she told the Mirror . &quot;It&#39;s usually my daughter or my agent or a friend and actually I like that, because I sit there and imagine the story in my mind.&quot; It&#39;s a condition her mother had before her, she said, and she has lenses and glasses to help — those things plus good old bright light. &quot;I do not wish for this to be overblown ...&quot; Dench said Monday in a statement sent to Reuters. &quot;It&#39;s something that I have learnt to cope with and adapt to — and it will not lead to blindness.&quot; To the Mirror, the James Bond-franchise actress and Oscar winner described a particularly irritating facet of the condition, however. &quot;The most distressing thing is in a restaurant in the evening I can’t see the person I’m having dinner with,&quot; she said, after explaining to the interviewer that while she could see his outline, his face remained a mystery. The National Institutes of Health, in its explanation of age-related macular degeneration as a disease that over time destroys sharp, clear central vision, includes pictures of how normal vision compares to the vision of someone with AMD .

He was hospitalized in high-altitude Aspen, Colo., over the holidays, then moved to Los Angeles for further treatment, reportedly for kidney issues.

I’ve been in the hospital since Friday. I was having a lot of pain in my back. ... I learned that I had blood clots in my lung ... an enlarged ventricle in the right side of my heart.&quot; The &quot;America&#39;s Got Talent&quot; host -- he&#39;s slated to return to that job this summer -- said Friday that he&#39;ll continue to host his syndicated &quot;Cannon&#39;s Countdown&quot; weekend program. &quot;I guess I can&#39;t drive at 200 mph for the whole road trip, Time to put the car in cruise control,&quot; he said on Twitter, adding, &quot;Even Super Man had to sleep!&quot; RELATED: Nick Cannon moved from Aspen to an L.A. hospital for treatment Nick Cannon hospitalized for kidney issues after family&#39;s Aspen holiday Nick Cannon has &quot;good prognosis,&quot; may be home soon, wife Mariah Carey says -- Christie D&#39;Zurilla twitter.com/dzurillaville Christie D&#39;Zurilla on Google+ Photo: Nick Cannon in Hollywood in October.

Demi Moore reportedly has been getting help for addiction and an eating disorder at a luxe Utah rehab since shortly after her hospitalization last month. After being hospitalized Jan. 23, she grabbed some things and headed to get help at the Cirque Lodge in Sundance, Utah, a rehab source told E! Online. &quot;She&#39;s on total lockdown and only talking to a small group of people,&quot; the source said . Other celebs treated at Cirque include Lindsay Lohan, Kirsten Dunst and, possibly concurrent with Demi, Brooke Mueller. [Updated, 6:45 p.m. Jan. 6: Or not . ] The timing of her check-in is in conflict with earlier reports that she&#39;d been visited at home last week by ex-husband Bruce Willis and estranged husband Ashton Kutcher, the latter of whom had been in Brazil when the 49-year-old actress &quot;smoked something&quot; and went into &quot;convulsions,&quot; as described on a 911 call made on her behalf. Those reports , however, said only that separate cars carrying the men had gone to Moore&#39;s home last Wednesday. Perhaps they visited the house, and not Demi?
