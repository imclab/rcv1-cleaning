So easy to use.. editing is easy and the listing looks fantastic! :) Thank you!   July 2013  Thanks carsales.com.au my car was listed on Tuesday, sold Wednesday! Both seller and buyer very happy. Buyer got a great car and a good price and I was able to buy another car listed on carsales.com.au. Winners all round. Thank you   February 2013  I'd like to compliment you on a fantastic website. The searchability and page return speed is beyond what most sites can achieve or are willing to offer. I know this stuff is not easy and it's a solid web and IT crew that make this happen. Please never compromise on what you've done here, from a customer standpoint it's a total success. Cheers.   February 2013  carsales.com.au worked a treat. I averaged about one enquiry per two days and happily moved my car on to the right sort of owner. Thanks again.   January 2013  We sold our car within 24 hours of publishing the ad. We are more than happy with the service and wouldn't hesitate to list other vehicles with you.    January 2013  The Carsales website is great. It was so much easier to look at cars at home on my computer than to go to lots of car yards. Being able to save suitable cars, look at the specific details of cars to compare them and read seller comments ensured my decision was more informed. I was able to buy a really good car at a competitive price. Thank you for this beaut website.   January 2013  I have at last sold my Toyota Cressida. It has been on the market for a very long time, and I am pleased it is going to a worthy owner. I would like to thank your team for the ad. and the patience you have shown me in the last few (many) months. See you next time I buy or sell.   November 2012   Bought a car from a dealer a month or so ago using your site and just wanted to tell you that I found the whole exercise very simple. I don't know whether you get much feedback when things go right but I think if things are done well then it is good for you to know. So easy to criticise but often praise goes unrewarded. Whether I got what I wanted is not important but the way I got it, through Carsales, was excellent. So thank you. I will certainly tell friends that my experience with your company was easy and I felt comfortable using your site.
