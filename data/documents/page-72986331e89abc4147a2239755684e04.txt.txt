A news magazine for today's savvy and informed American audience, "Day 6" takes each week's biggest stories -- from news headlines to pop culture -- and explores them in unexpected ways. Irreverent columnists and playful use of sound and texture gives "Day 6" a healthy dose of humor and charm. Host Brent Bambury, a seasoned radio and television journalist skilled at giving dynamic interviews and keen analysis, embodies the show's energetic pace and sharp wit. Produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC), "Day 6" currently airs on PRI affiliate stations KUOW/Seattle, WFPL/Louisville, WBEZ/Chicago, KWMR/Point Reyes-California and WAMU-HD3/Maryland, with new stations to be announced in the coming months. "'Day 6' and Brent Bambury are bringing a different twist to the week's news, sometimes attacking it directly, sometimes finding a new or unexpected angle," said Todd Mundt, Program Director at WFPL in Louisville. "Some of the stories won't show up anywhere else on public radio, and that's refreshing too. The interviews are pointed and thoughtful, and the show sounds snappy, aware and connected." Sean Aucoin, Continuity and Acquisitions Manager at WBEZ in Chicago, says "Day 6" is an exciting addition to his station's weekend line-up as it "brings fresh content with an energetic pace and sound to our Saturday afternoons. Host Brent Bambury asks the questions that we/listeners want to hear. The show succeeds in blending energy and life with news and culture creating a program that is both thoughtful and fun." The tremendous amount of positive listener feedback "Day 6" generated at stations like WFPL and WBEZ during piloting was critical to considering it for wider distribution in the U.S., according to PRI&rsquo;s Senior Director of Content Development and Strategy, Michael Arnold. "Listeners are an important part of the mix when we're testing shows in various markets," said Arnold. "We know from listeners and stations that Brent Bambury's skills as a host will make this program an energizing addition to any station's schedule. The format of the program fits well with people's busy weekend routine. PRI is very happy to expand its CBC relationship with this wonderful new program." CBC's Executive Director of Radio and Audio, Chris Boyce adds, "We at CBC Radio are very proud to join PRI in presenting 'Day 6' with Brent Bambury to our American public radio listeners. 'Day 6' has become a must-listen show for Canadians with its surprising take on the week's news and its eclectic blend of journalism, opinion and humor. We're thrilled that &lsquo;Day 6&rsquo; will join 'Q' with Jian Ghomeshi, 'As it Happens' and 'WireTap' in the American marketplace." In its role of providing global perspectives and diverse voices to American listeners on air, and online, PRI began its distribution partnership with the CBC in 2006. "Day 6," the fourth show from the CBC to be distributed in the U.S. exclusively by PRI, rounds out the public media organization&rsquo;s award-winning portfolio of global and national news, current affairs, talk, arts and music programming.

PRI leads by identifying critical but unmet content needs and partnering with producers, stations, digital networks and funders to develop multi-platform resources to meet those needs. By creating an environment in which innovation can thrive, PRI supports the creation and distribution of content that would otherwise be unavailable and that brings new voices, global journalism and cultural perspectives to the American public.
