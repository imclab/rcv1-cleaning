Triumph DVDs NEW The Triumph DVD series of productions started almost by accident.For years John Clancy had been talking about making a properdocumentary about the conception, development and history of the TR7and TR8 wedge based sports cars. His reasoning was quite logicalreally: no other car had ever had such a convoluted evolution nor sucha controversial life in the market place. These cars had a reallyinteresting story to tell and it had never been told in film, until now. Each DVD is $25 + shipping and handling.
