 Convertible Car Club Home Members Sponsors Photos Pages Discussions More Polls Files Promote Join us! Let's Ride!   How cool is it going to be when you are riding around town and you know the driver of another passing convertible? How about when you park in a lot and you say... Oh look "So and so" is here ! ? That's my goal, for all of us to share that sense of community wherever we are...all over town.   Care to share the dream? Then put your clothes on and your tops down... let's go cruise and have some fun!  I believe there is something unique about people that love convertible cars, and I bet you will agree with me on that! The events will be what we want to create, from good beer to fine wine and of course from greasy burgers to the BLT. The ideas are limitless! Please take a moment to share your favorite drive ..and why...on the message board, since we will try to join you! Let's go take some drives, have some wine and get some good eats!   Also don't forget to tell others to join our group!     Join us Who do I know here?
