The series was originallytitled Kentucky&#39;s Kid and was designed to star Jack Carson...&quot;Australia&#39;s TV Time notes the following on his leaving in a 1962interview with James Arness: http://cayman.globat.com/~trademarksnet.com/GUNSMOKE/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/Interviews/Arness22Sept62.PDF &quot;...Arness said: &quot;We&#39;ve all probably had our secret doubts about goingon with it.&quot; He pushed his dusty Stetson back on his head and addedcandidly: &quot;Maybe there isn&#39;t much more I can do with the role afterall this time. But so what? The dough&#39;s stillcoming in, and I couldkeep on playing Matt Dillon forever. When Dennis left the show thispast season to seek out greener pastures I told him he&#39;d be back.And,&quot; Arness pointed out, &quot;he did return. But for awhile it was kindof tough trying to figure out what would happen to the show with himgone. Public opinion called him back. We were swamped with lettersasking for him. So when his own TV show idea fell through he cameback. I was mighty happy to see him.&quot;...Evidently, after 7 years or so relationships had eroded among theactors. Weaver left for the starring role mentioned above.Search Strategy:chester&#39;s OR weaver&#39;s +&quot;last episode&quot; +gunsmokewhy did dennis weaver leave gunsmokeI trust my research has provided you with the answer you desired.
