Plenty of others, too, like  Virgil Exner, Jr. talking about both his and his father&#8217;s careers and a lot of first-person stories about working for Raymond Loewy, and  Gordon Buehrig , who talks extensively about the processes involved in coachbuilt cars like the Duesenbergs and Auburns he was responsible for, complete with a great little one about how Auburn&#8217;s chief engineer tuned their eight-carb V-12 in the dark, by checking the color of the flames coming out of the exhaust. There&#8217;s just a ton of fascinating history in these stories, and even though they&#8217;re clunky in their presentation, and quite long, they&#8217;re worth every word. If you have any interest in design history, you should check &#8216;em out. <div class="date clearfix"> <div class="date_holder">  <span class="month">Jan<span class="year"> 2012 </span></span><span class="day">31</span> </div> NEWS | Ian Callum, Ed Welburn, Imre Molnar talk design on Autoweek&#8217;s Vinsetta Garage 0 Posted In Blog , Car Culture , News by Robert Gelardi Image credit: Leanne Staples I love Tuesdays if for no other reason than to watch Velocity after my kid goes to bed.
