It may sound like a nightmare to some, but with due diligence, it’s been a dream for many drivers. By  Doug Newcomb  of MSN Autos Click to enlarge picture For those who need a utility vehicle for hauling kids or cargo, former rental units such as the Ford Explorer can be a savvy used car purchase. With dozens of YouTube videos depicting gratuitous abuse of rental cars, it's not surprising that many consumers shy away from buying one. But talk to a few people who have bought a former rental car and you'll get a very different picture. Kristen Reeves of Lowell, Massachusetts, for example, initially had her doubts about buying a rental car when she shopped for a vehicle last summer and found a 2007 Ford Explorer with only 5,000 miles. "I asked the Ford dealer to provide a vehicle history report," Reeves recalls, "and it said it had been a rental car. I have to admit that at first I thought, 'What has this vehicle been through?' It didn't scare me off," she admits, "but it did make me think twice." She bought the Explorer and now describes it as "fantastic." "I can't complain about anything," Reeves reports. "I haven't had any issues whatsoever. And the Ford dealership has stood by it and they fully honor the warranty." Check It Out Like everyone contacted for this article who had bought a rental car, Reeves is extremely happy with her vehicle. But she also emphasizes the importance of due diligence with any such large purchase. "I looked it over from top to bottom," she says, "and I was able to test drive it for a day." Treat a rental car as you would any used car, advises Bob Aiken, a former National Association of Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) master mechanic. "Find an independent shop that you trust and pay to have the car inspected," he suggests. "Even if you have to walk away from the deal, it is money well spent." John Nielsen, director of approved auto repair and auto buying networks for AAA, concurs. "Have a mechanic get it on a lift and look over the car thoroughly," he insists. He also urges obtaining a vehicle history report through a service such as CARFAX. An upside to rental cars, Nielsen points out, is that they often receive great maintenance, "so there's no reason they wouldn't be as good or reliable in the long run as any other used car." Rental Returns Tim Walsh, senior vice president of Enterprise Car Sales believes, of course, that rental cars are better and more reliable than any other used cars. "They go through regular checkups and service maintenance throughout their life in our rental fleet," he notes. Vehicles move from Enterprise's rental fleet to its sales lots when they are one- to two-years old and have between 15,000 to 30,000 miles, Walsh says. And all vehicles go through a rigorous inspection before being offered for sale. "Those are done by independent, ASE-certified technicians, not our own mechanics," he adds. And if you think buying a rented ride means settling for a run-of-the-mill Ford Focus , Chevrolet Impala or Chrysler Sebring , think again. Some rental car companies offer a wide spectrum of vehicles, many of which go on sale after fleet use. In Los Angeles, for example, Hertz offers renters everything from the Nissan 350Z and Ford Mustang convertibles to the Toyota Prius and Chevrolet Corvette , in addition to the Audi A4 , Volvo S80 and Infiniti M35 .

I wasn't expecting to buy my car the same day I walked in so I didn't have the full amount of money in my bank account, but this was not a problem. They never called to ask me when I was coming in with the full amount, I had to call them to tell them when I would have the money for them. &#160;It was a complete 180 from what I experienced at the dealership! I highly recommend buying a car from Enterprise.&#160;      17      2 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... POd in SD Jul 29, 2011 8:13PM My last 3 cars have been rentals. I have driven in excess of 100k miles w hit each. They have all been very good and economical vehicles. Plus, I got features like leather that I would not normally get for the price. Check the history and inspect the vehicle thourghly. Previous damage can help you negotiate. A small rearender saved me $3k and the repair was done very well. So well that my guy didn't pickup on it.      16      9 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply...
