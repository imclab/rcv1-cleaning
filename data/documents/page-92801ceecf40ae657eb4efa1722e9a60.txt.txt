Although there were a few bumps along the way due to the laws and title assignment, you were professional as well as patient and friendly. You were also sensitive to the whole situation as the car you purchased was my mothers and she had recently passed. It was difficult for me to sell the car but you were able to get me through the process without any frustration. I want to thank you for being the professional you are and I definitely will recommend you to others that have a vehicle for sale. Jarret B. Deerfield Beach, FL From the first phone call to Cashforcaraonline.com to signing the bill of sale, I was impressed with their level of professionalism, honesty and friendliness. I would certainly recommend this company and foresee doing business with them again in the future. Richard L. Port St Lucie, FL &#8220;When I decided to sell my car, I didn&#8217;t want to go through the long process of finding a buyer (i.e. asking around,  parking the car on the side of the road, taking pictures and posting them on the internet, etc.). I found Cash for Cars Online through Google, and they had a simple and direct approach to buying my car. They came to me, appraised the car, and after settling on a price, they wrote a check for the car. Everything was simple, legit and secure. I would recommend Cash for Cars Online to anyone looking for a quick and simple way to sell their car.&#8221; Mike B. West Palm Beach, FL My car loan was two months past due. Cashforcarsonline.com paid off my car and paid me $500 over my loan amount. Very smooth transaction! Thanks guys. Oded Y. Plantation, FL I Had my 04 Audi A6 listed on Craigslist and had no luck selling (high miles). I found Henry with Cash For Cars Online and he bought my car the same day! These guys are great. Alvin P.

I recommend everyone to go to CashForCarsOnline. Thank you so very much! Allison B. Davie, FL I had a great experience with the guys from Cashforcarsonline; they were funny, professional, and very prompt. I had kept my car after buying a new one because I was sure I would take the time to sell it privately. Well&#8230;five months later it was still sitting there in my driveway. I went to Carmax and got a quote and then found Henry and Lior online. Sure enough, they came out the next day. We visited for 15 minutes, agreed on a price, and they were back with a bank certified check in another fifteen. They also beat Carmax&#8217;s price by $500. Painless! Gus C. Wellington, FL You appraised and bought my auto today and I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you how much I appreciated your team’s professionalism and integrity. From the first gentleman, Henry that set up my appraisal to the appraiser himself, Lior  it was a joy for my wife, Betty and I to do business with you. The price was excellent and the payment was immediate. Again, I just wanted to say thanks.
