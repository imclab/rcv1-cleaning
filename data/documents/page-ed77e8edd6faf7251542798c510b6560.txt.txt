 Movie Review 
 'The World's End' 
 &nbsp; 
 &#147;The World&#146;s End&#148; is more frantic than funny, but it&#146;s still funny enough -- just -- to outweigh its own silliness. It&#146;s hard to dislike a movie that blames the Internet on aliens.

 Movie Review 
 'You're Next' 
 &nbsp; 
 Adam Wingard&#146;s sly, diabolical, and oddly moral &#147;You&#146;re Next&#148; draws on the home invasion/haunted house scenario, but outclasses them with its wit, irony, and technically proficient terror.

 O Vertigo Danse propelled by a relentless beat 
 &#147;La Vie Qui Bat (The Beat of Life)&#148; is both repetitive and exultant, the continuously streaming movement a physical prose poem whose dynamics wax and wane. 
 
 Stage Review 
 Equestrian spectacle &#145;Odysseo&#146; offers wild ride 
 Though it contains its share of bombast and certainly can&#146;t be called understated, &#147;Odysseo&#146;&#146; makes room for periods of relative stillness. In those moments, we can savor the visual splendor of horses.
