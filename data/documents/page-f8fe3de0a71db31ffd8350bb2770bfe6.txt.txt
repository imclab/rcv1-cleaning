The reason for this is that the faster the object, the faster your shutter speed can be. If you look at some of the best aircraft panning you&#8217;ll notice that shutter speeds tend to be in the 1/400th to 1/800th of a second range.&#8221; Continue reading &raquo; Should replica cars beillegal? The point of this post is not to start contemplating whether a meticulously handcrafted aluminium ‘250 GTO’ built using original parts on a 250 GTE chassis should be scrapped, nor whether you should be arrested for attaching M-Car ephemera to your 1.8-litre E36 (though that’s arguably another sort of crime…).

If I asked you to name an Aston Martin model that wasn&#8217;t built in the UK, your answer might refer to pre-2012 Rapides, or one of the shooting brakes put together by Beat Roos&#8217; team in Frauenkappelen.

This &#8216;record&#8217; allegedly trounced something engineered in Germany, by a group of world experts, at a cost of half a billion dollars. Despite having no proof, the former company&#8217;s &#8216;record&#8217; is now indexed on more than 25,000 web pages around the world.
