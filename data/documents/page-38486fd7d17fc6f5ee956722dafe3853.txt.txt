Comments  (0) Thursday 10/04/2012  Students gather to read and take pictures with banned books    Christopher JamesA&E; Editor  Posted: October 04, 2012  What do “The Hunger Games” and “The Catcher in the Rye” have in common? Besides centering on troubled young adults in a harsh world, they are also two of many classic or popular novels that are banned or have had their content seriously challenged. During Convo this past Tuesday, Oct. 2, the William H. Hannon Library set up a table out in front of the Lair Marketplace filled with some of the most popular and classic books which just happen to be banned by some sectors of the U.S. Students were invited to take their pictures with the banned books of their choice, and one person was selected to win a free T-shirt to commemorate Banned Book Week. When asked his favorite banned book, mechanical engineering graduate student Rendle Myles (pictured below) said, “I chose ‘The Color Purple’ because of how it dealt with the racism against blacks in the 1960s.” Sophomore film production major Ashley Wilson found the event to be important and informative. “Not a lot of people know [these books] are banned. People come up and are surprised ‘The Hunger Games’ is banned. People know these books are cherished,” Wilson said While many of the students who attended the event grabbed “The Hunger Games” to take pictures with, other students had unique tastes in banned books. Sophomore marketing and English double major Jenny Yu, a copy editor at the Loyolan, picked “East of Eden” as her banned book to take a picture with. “That book is so enlightening about so many issues. Steinback is the bomb,” she said. Whatever one’s taste is, it seems that most people have at least once cherished book that is banned in certain communities.

All it takes is scrolling through the local Barnes and Noble calendar to catch a particularly interesting Q&amp;A with an author. The Loyolan was contacted by Picador, the publishing company behind Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jeffrey Eugenides’ work, about publishing an interview with the author. Having written “The Virgin Suicides,” “Middlesex” and “The Marriage Plot,” Eugenides certainly knows how to get inside the psyche of a young adult audience. His college career was a time in his life that was of particular interest to him, and he has done interviews specifically geared towards college audience. The following is an interview done with Eugenides by James Meador of Picador publishing company.

Read for pleasure, that is.Alright, so some of our assigned reading is pleasurable, but rarelyis it as pleasurable as hunkering down in a comfy chair with anovel of our own choosing. Those of us who once consideredourselves avid readers when we were younger now feel undeserving ofthe title because our list of completed pleasure books growssmaller every year, while our list of 'to-read' books grows longer.The busier we become, the more and more difficult it is to findtime to read a novel that we want to read.

By Nick Blodgett  Updated: August 30, 2011 - 12:12 pm  I know as Americans we're supposed to hold some disdain for theBritish; after all, there was that little revolution and there'sthat whole thing of tea time in the afternoon, which, try as Imight, I can't get my head around. But credit must be given whencredit is due. Since the late 1970s the Brits have been putting outthe weekly comic anthology magazine, "2000 A.D.," featuring a widearray of science fiction and fantasy, as well as a little horrormixed in every now and again. Not only is "2000 A.D." worthmentioning for the simple fact that it has been coming out weeklyfor such a long time, it also boasts content that often goes aboveand beyond the simple superhero fodder so popular in the UnitedStates.

By Nick Blodgett  Updated: August 30, 2011 - 12:11 pm  Believe it or not, boys and girls, but the comic book industryhas long been a battleground for freedom of speech ; starting inthe 1950s with congressional hearings aimed at determining theirsupposed impact on rising juvenile delinquency. The publisher mostheavily targeted during these witch hunts was E.C. Comics.Ultimately, the hearings resulted in the "comics' code" whichbasically sucked all creativity and intelligence out of the medium.Throughout comics' history there have been those who opposed thecode ? mainly the underground era of the sixties and seventies, themagazine craze of the eighties and the birth of independent andalternative comics in the nineties leading up to the present. Thecomics' code has now been abolished, and E.C. Comics can be read intheir full, uncensored glory.  Posted in      Literature    on   Monday, February 11, 2008 12:00 am.   Updated: 12:11 pm.
