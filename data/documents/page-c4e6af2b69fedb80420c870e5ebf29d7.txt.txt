But they are fun. Think (historically) about the Morgan Three-Wheeler , which really did look like a car. Or the modern Blackjack Zero , powered by a Moto Guzzi twin. Now there&#8217;s an electric-powered variant. It&#8217;s called the &#8220;Bug E,&#8221; and is made by Harvey Coachworks in Knoxville, Md. The Bug E is a single-seater with a clear canopy, open at the back. Presumably, you can ride in the rain. Just don&#8217;t stop. The Bug E starts at $9,295.

Have we got a car for you, assuming you&#8217;ve hit that fantasy wall. Of course, it helps if you like old cars, or just oldish-looking cars. Back in the 1940s, Sydney Allard, an English car guy, started making cars with American engines, big V8s. Flash forward to today and, according to a thorough piece in AutoWeek , Roger Allard (no relation to Sydney) has formed Allard Motor Works , headquartered in Montreal, and is making the cars in Champlain, N.Y. The retail price for a new Allard starts at a shade more than $128,000, but look at it this way: If you can sell your condo to buy the Allard (and don&#8217;t mind sleeping on the beach), then this is the deal for you.

Really? How about a little sunshine, given all the economic rain we&#8217;ve been enduring for what seems like eons. Here it is. Mr. Sunshine. It&#8217;s the Porsche museum at the eponymous car maker&#8217;s headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. Of course, for most of us it requires an airplane ticket, but if you are one of the truly devoted you will be on that plane forthwith. The museum was scheduled to open Jan. 31. Here&#8217;s what you can expect, according to a recent Associated Press story : some 80 cars that truly characterize Porsche&#8217;s stellar history since the firm started turning out these lovable little beasts in 1948. Among the cars: a 917 race car, like the one Steve McQueen drove in &#8220;Le Mans;&#8221; a 550 Spyder, similar to the one actor James Dean owned, the one he was in when he was killed in a road accident in central California Sept. 30, 1955. The museum also has a floor with several generations of 911 turbo cars. And as a personal aside, the museum is not far from Stuttgart. I spent a bit more than a year in that area, a denizen of Seventh Army &#8216;s G-2 section. And yes, we did see a lot of Porsches around there. Too bad I didn&#8217;t buy one back then.

Share this: Comments Email Print 0 Out here where cars are more than just appliances, from time to time we&#8217;ve all seen cars as art, autos as rolling sculpture. In fact, some of them are pure sculpture that will make any given car freak go weak in the knees when, say, a Ferrari Lusso rolls past, or a Porsche 911 and its descendants. Lewis deSoto, a Napa conceptual artist, has rolled his passion for cars into, well, a car, and he calls it his counterfeit DeSoto, an eponymous vehicle if I ever did see one. The car is a sculpture called Conquest and, at first, it&#8217;s a bit confusing. Is it a car? Is it a sculpture made from the healthy scouring of a dozen or two junkyards? Lewis took a 1965 Chrysler Newport and simply rebadged it as a DeSoto.(You can see more at his Web site . Click on Sculpture, then click on 2004 Conquest.) DeSoto was a division of Chrysler , and the cars were made from model year 1929 to 1961 before Chrysler gave up and folded its DeSoto tent. There are still devotees of the marque, however, and it&#8217;s become something of a collectible . So why is this a work of art, Lewis? &#8220;I straddle both worlds,&#8221; he said the other day in an interview with Top Down. &#8220;I&#8217;m obsessed with cars, with their power, style and comfort. I&#8217;m also interested in cars as metaphors, metaphors for power. DeSoto was definitely associated with the history of America.&#8221; Conquest, the ersatz DeSoto, will be on display from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. outside the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art , 560 South First Street, San Jose, Friday, Feb. 6. That is the night of an opening reception for a retrospective exhibition of deSoto&#8217;s work, which will be on display at the institute from Jan. 31 through March 28. He&#8217;s definitely a car guy and apparently this affinity for the internal combusion engine can be found in a lot of his work.

Share this: Comments Email Print 0 When I first started reviewing cars, the auto manufacturers&#8217; representatives would hand over the keys to the review car, then ask me to sign a piece of paper acknowledging that I was now fully responsible for their $40,000 baby. Then they&#8217;d hand over the sheaf of papers and say something like, &#8220;everything&#8217;s in there, including the Monroney.&#8221; The what? I would say, thanks, right, got it, and then wonder what the Monroney was. It&#8217;s the window sticker, the document that must be on the window of every new car and truck sold in America. The Monroney is now 50 years old and you can thank ex-reporter Almer (Mike) Monroney, the late Democratic U.S. senator from Oklahoma, for the eponymous sticker. As the New York Times explained the other day , in a piece celebrating the half century of Monroneys that have adorned hundreds of millions of cars in thousands of U.S. showrooms, Sen. Monroney was the chief impetus behind the Automobile Information Disclosure Act of 1958 . Before window stickers, buyers had to rely on the dealer for information about how much the car cost, what options were on it, and so on. &#8220;Between the factory and the dealer&#8217;s lot,&#8221; the Times story said, &#8220;hundreds or even thousands of dollars of extras &#8212; including exorbitant shipping charges and a multitude of options, some more valid than others &#8212; could be added to the price.&#8221; The Monroney changed all that by requiring the posting of full information on the car&#8217;s price, options and other details. So here&#8217;s to you, senator. Thanks for the Monroney.

It&#8217;s car-nut heaven, as long as you leave your checkbook (or credit cards) at home. This is auction frenzy time &#8212; the big-deal auctioneers haul out their consigned collector cars and go for the biggest buck around. (Good luck, in these parlous times, but, given some of the items that will be on the block, it should be interesting for the spectators, at least.) Actually, that&#8217;s the point of all this: Hitting these auctions is kind of like hitting a rolling kaleidoscope of auto museums. There is, however, a school of thought among car collectors that the auctions, which have become popular as a sort of gathering ground or watering hole for car people, have also inflated the collector car market. Some of the people I talked to at last summer&#8217;s auctions at Pebble Beach said they were there just to see what the prices were doing, how this car or that car fared on the auction block. When it came time to buy, these guys were not raising paddles at Pebble Beach or any other auction. Instead, if they were looking for something special, they were dickering through private networks, word of mouth, obscure ads on various Web sites, friends in the business, restoration shops. Dale Thomas, a longtime California collector (asked how many cars he&#8217;s had, he said, &#8220;probably 100 to 150&#8243;), feels that the highly publicized auctions have turned the collector car hobby into &#8220;nothing but a commercial venture.&#8221; He said in an interview with Top Down that he refuses to sell his 1970 Datsun 240-Z, the 3,003d Z-car made, to &#8220;the people who&#8217;ve inquired. They want to buy it cheap, then sell it for $40,000 to $50,000. I don&#8217;t want that for this car. It needs to go to an enthusiast, someone who is going to enjoy the car, who has no thoughts about making money off it. It&#8217;s more fun to deal with someone like that.&#8221; And speaking of barn finds &#8212; they&#8217;re the long-lost treasures that crop up from time to time, with decreasing frequency &#8212; take a look at this Bugatti find that just cropped up in England. At any rate, if you want to go see some of the world&#8217;s better rides, here are the details (the individual auction Web sites have information about the cars, spectator and bidder admission prices and all the ancillary events): In Scottsdale: Jan. 11-18, is the Barrett-Jackson fest, a week of collector cars on the block. Jan. 14-18, check out Russo and Steele . Jan. 17, have a look at Gooding and Co. &#8216;s wares. I particularly liked Lot No. 60, a 1955 Airstream Bubble Trailer, billed as &#8220;the factory experimental prototype.&#8221; It&#8217;s nestled in between Lot No. 59, the slightly overdescribed &#8220;Deco Rides Deco Liner &amp; Harley Davidson Deco Scoot,&#8221; and Lot. No. 61, a 2003 Ferrari Enzo. In Phoenix: RM Auctions trots out its cars at the Arizona Biltmore on Jan. 16. Jan. 22-25, Kruse International will be at the Arizona State Fairgrounds.

They were housed in a few warehouses in Sparks, Nevada, just east of Reno, where Harrah had one of his money-making (make that Money-making) casinos, the 24-hour-a-day/we-never-close mint that kept him in Ferraris, Franklins and a few other exotics that made up the 1,450-car collection he doted over. After Harrah died in 1978, Holiday Inns took over the Harrah empire. The cars were eventually sold off in three auctions during the 1980s, but more than 200 of them stayed in Reno and were installed in the National Automobile Museum . ( I wrote about the place back in 2007.) It&#8217;s worth a visit &#8212; if nothing else, it&#8217;s really worth a visit just to see the Jerrari, Harrah&#8217;s idea of a 1970s-era SUV. It&#8217;s a Jeep Wagoneer with Ferrari running gear stuffed into it. Go figure.

Share this: Comments Email Print 0 I don&#8217;t think this is going to put a major dent in the nation&#8217;s classic and antique car restoration business, but it is an interesting wrinkle on the old-car scene. If you want the ur -authentic resto by the people (or their descendants) who built your treasure, you might try the factory. Barry Jagolinzer did, with his 1966 Ferrari 275GTB2 . Other auto makers have joined in on this sidelight to manufacturing high-end cars. If carried to its logical extreme, what&#8217;s next? Toyota will restore your &#8217;03 Camry?

Share this: Comments Email Print 0 There&#8217;s always a car angle, even on Christmas. So&#8230;. when I Googled Christmas Car, I did come up with a site that&#8217;s on point. It&#8217;s a bit like the &#8220;art car&#8221; culture, but geared (so to speak) more toward one specific day. Back in Realityville, I hope everyone has gone to see if their stockings are stuffed with a Ferrari F430 Spider or perhaps an Aston Martin DB9 or a Porsche Boxster S or a Honda S2000 . (Frankly, for Reality-driving, I&#8217;d rather have one of the latter two.) And if you actually are thinking of getting a new car (as such, you&#8217;re part of a dwindling demographic), you might well think of donating the old one to charity. There are a lot of hurting people out there these days and the funds distributed by charities that sell your old clunker could help somebody who can&#8217;t afford to get a new car &#8212; or any car, for that matter. Here&#8217;s one typical charity site . You can find more by Googling the phrase auto donations. Happy Holidays, everyone.

It&#8217;s the Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance &#8212; &#8220;Pebble&#8221; is the shorthand &#8212; and the name actually applies to a whole gamut of automotive activities that, for tens of thousands of lovers of fine machinery, make it a cross between the most intense piece of dark chocolate and a pass to wallow in the chocolate pit for as long as your legs (and, in the case of the auctions, your money) will hold out. It is Northern California&#8217;s annual bacchanalia of beautiful cars, a world-renowned paean to the Bentleys and Buicks, Ferraris and Fords, Porsches and Pontiacs that have carried royalty and race drivers and everyone in between for decades. These are also the cars that are considered the cream of the world&#8217;s crop when it comes to the fastidious attention to detail in their restoration, care and ongoing maintenance, even though most of them are sometimes derisively known as &#8220;trailer queens,&#8221; because they arrived in the back of a huge tractor-trailer rig. But this is not just a car show. The concours, now in its 58th year, has spawned art shows, historic racing at nearby Laguna Seca, and tents full of auto memorabilia (car-related posters, books, jewelry, clothing.)
