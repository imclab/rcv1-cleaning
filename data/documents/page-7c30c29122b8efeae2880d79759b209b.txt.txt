Smith Donovan Widmer Crystal Hui-Shu Yang Staff Facilities and Resources Visiting Artists Events Contact   Department of Art &amp; Design   The Department of Art &amp; Design provides opportunities for both the potential professional practitioner and the appreciator to study in various disciplines and media of the visual arts — including graphic design as well as fine arts areas. A core of study in the foundations of the visual arts is followed by the development of skills and technical knowledge in the various media. These are prerequisite to the ultimate objective of nurturing growth in conceptual ability and creative production. The Department of Art &amp; Design’s faculty are highly qualified and dedicated teachers, who are also seriously committed to professional productivity in their respective art disciplines. The Edmund Hughes Fine Arts Center provides more than 35,000 square feet for specialized studios and opportunities for work in visual arts media.The University of North Dakota is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. The University of North Dakota’s Department of Art &amp; Design plays a vital role in the cultural climate of its vicinity. We are the largest and most complete art and design department within this upper plains region outside Minneapolis—as well as the only art and design department within the geographical area of North Dakota and South Central Canada offering the terminal degree (M.F.A) in studio art. As such, we have a particularly strong commitment to artistic productivity and all of our art and design program areas encourage students to think creatively as visual artists as they explore and develop images in ethical and diverse ways.  The Department of Art &amp; Design faculty is committed to creative productivity and scholarly research and their presentation through exhibitions and publications. By exhibiting works, presenting papers at professional conferences, and/or publishing research, the faculty aims to set examples as role models who encourage students to engage in similar activities. Additionally, whether we are addressing our students, exhibiting artwork, producing scholarly publications, or functioning as a knowledge base for the general public, we regard art and design as essential components of daily life. Moreover, we view art and design as among the most significant means by which the collective culture is transmitted and how civilizations are historically measured. With these thoughts in mind, our faculty and teaching staff are committed to providing education to those who are interested in participating in this cultural dialogue.   Department of Art &amp; Design | Tel:701-777-2257 Hughes Fine Arts Center | 3350 Campus Road, Stop 7099 ouTube Skip to contact information | Skip to global UND navigation Headlines Latest News Top Events Features Videos Explore Virtual Tour Schedule a Visit Maps | Parking Photos The University of North Dakota Resources Fields of Study Libraries | Tech Support Translate | Accessibility Emergency Management Contact Telephone: 701-777-3000 Toll Free: 1-800-CALL-UND UND.info@email.und.edu Live Chat &copy;2013 University of North Dakota - Grand Forks, ND - Member of ND University System - Terms of Use / Privacy Policy - Website Feedback Report a copyright infringement Skip to global navigation | Skip to main content  Last Modified 10/27/12
