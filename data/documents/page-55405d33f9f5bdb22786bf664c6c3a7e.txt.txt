Aside from losing two doors, the i3 Concept Coupe features several detail changes compared with previous iterations. The Coupe picks up a more production- and safety-friendly side treatment, ditching the earlier glass-heavy design for a more conventional beltline. A closer-to-production interior design is also revealed, featuring more realistic controls throughout, although the center stack differs notably to that revealed in recent spy photos. The rear valance has also been reshaped, with production-necessary reflectors now integrated.  Built on the same 2570mm wheelbase as the earlier five-door concepts, the Concept Coupe maintains the five-door&rsquo;s 2+2 seating configuration. The Concept Coupe&rsquo;s drivetrain also matches the earlier concepts, with a rear-mounted 125kW/250Nm electric motor driving the rear wheels through a single-speed transmission, and powered by a lithium-ion battery cell. BMW&rsquo;s press material describes the Concept Coupe as &quot;demonstrating the potential for conceivably extending the model range&quot;, suggesting that the three-door bodystyle may indeed reach production alongside the five-door. The production i3 is expected to appear as a five-door first though, debuting some time in 2013.
