 Ryukyu Soul: Japanese Car Culture Est. 2007 Skip to content Home About Staff &larr; Older posts The ReturnHome Posted on June 10, 2012 | Leave a comment Australia was a good time. While it was a business trip, a good portion of it was just the vacation I needed to relax. I needed it because now that I&#8217;ve returned, things around the island have become a lot more hectic. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing because RS will be undergoing some changes. For starters, make your way over to Dr. Track blog and the Facebook page . They are big supporters of this site and do their best to promote enthusiasm and awareness of Japanese automobiles. Dr. Track is building an international cult of like-minded car lovers and RS is honored to be a part of it. Expect collaborative efforts between the two sites in the coming weeks. Moving on, we&#8217;re venturing into the world of 7Tune . As time goes on and fameONE Photography gets more and more recognition, the Dons of the car blog mafia are taking notice. I jest. Adam Zillin, one the heads of 7Tune is also a supporter of fameONE and RS. He&#8217;s done a wonderful job of building up his empire while taking the time to reach out and befriend those who are still on the come up. As for the personal bit: I&#8217;ll be in a new BNR32 soon enough. Be patient. A lot has happened and this site, as well as my stay in Japan, were in jeopardy. A man with nothing to lose is reckless. A man with everything to lose is dangerous because he would rather die than give up what he&#8217;s built. The future of Okinawa&#8217;s car culture and being a firsthand witness to friendships forming simply over a beer or casual conversation about cars is what I live for. Thanks for welcoming me back with open arms, Okinawa.

I&#8217;ve seemed to hit a bit of a snag. And by snag, I&#8217;m in the process of replacing the subframe to my GT-R after hitting a patch of gravel, locking the brakes and sliding into a curb. What initially seemed like an easy fix of control arms has become a massive fiasco. This GT-R is a bit of a money pit, but it&#8217;s worth it. I love this car, I just don&#8217;t exactly love what it&#8217;s doing to my wallet. Oh well, this is what it&#8217;s all about. At the end of the day, if the bills are paid. I&#8217;m happy. In site news, I&#8217;ll be leaving for Australia in a few weeks. I&#8217;ll be in Melbourne for about a month for media-related purposes. This will be a nice location for a working vacation. I&#8217;m looking forward to it. In the meantime, I&#8217;m looking for additional photographers in Okinawa who can take photos for the site and the tumblr page. The ability to write is also a plus. I&#8217;ll pay you in self-esteem&#8230; and, perhaps, free photoshoots. Well, discounted photoshoots. We&#8217;ll work something out. One more thing; you know that really sexy purple C35 Laurel with the highlighter pink Gram Lights on it? No? Well, you will. The photoshoot was done today and I&#8217;m awaiting a detailed modification list so I can complete a, somewhat in-depth, feature. On top of that, I still need to take some day shots of Kojo&#8217;s S15. Stay tuned, kids. -fameONE 26.281575 127.778634 &rarr; 1 Comment Posted in Site News Tagged BNR32 , fameONE Kojo&#8217;s Mean, CleanS15 Posted on March 27, 2012 | 2 Comments The lightweight, rear-wheel drive layout of the Nissan Silvia has become synonymous with drifting in the automotive world.  They’re relatively cheap to modify and parts from them can be found virtually anywhere in Japan. In the same respect, it is rare to see drift missile Silvias in pristine condition due to all of the battle scars from days at the track or on the streets. When Sasha Korjenic, owner of this aesthetically pleasing, lightly modified, S15 tells people that he doesn’t drift, and has no interest in drifting, people look at him like he’s crazy. It’s simple, this car does not serve the purpose of being thrashed around the track, it is a low-and-slow head turner. Korjenic is well aware that there is a ridiculous craze dominating the Japanese automotive scene in the western world where kids obsessively get their cars as low as humanly possible, adjusting the toe angle to the point where the car isn’t drivable. While the Silvia’s suspension setup has attracted attention of the “stance-heads” of the western world, his car is still very much a daily driver.  Sitting on a set of beautiful, chrome SSR Professor SP-1 rims, the car’s color is nicely accented. The size of the rims (18&#215;9 front, 18&#215;9.5 rear) are tastefully matched with his suspension setup. Cusco coilovers and rear upper control arms along with Circuit Sports toe arms are all Korjenic needs to have this clean S15 sitting mean on the streets of Okinawa. -fameONE This slideshow requires JavaScript. 26.315958 127.756257 &rarr; 2 Comments Posted in Hard Parking Tagged fameONE , Japan , Mihama , Nissan , Okinawa , S15 , Silvia Okinawa Super Drift Series: Mar.11 Posted on March 11, 2012 | 1 Comment On an unseasonably cold and rainy day in Okinawa, the streets were wet, and most people were nestled inside the warmth and comfort of their homes. Most people were kilometers away from the burning rubber and screaming sounds of fence pipes of battled hardened drift machines that dominated the Yukari pasture. These people do not have gasoline and motor oil pumping through their veins. These are the people who do not have the love and dedication to participate in such an incredible showing of drift showmanship. The rest of us enjoyed street performing in a controlled environment. There was no shortage of prominent Okinawa drift teams in attendance, nor was there a shortage of household Okinawan garages. The Mar. 11 event for the Okinawa Super Drift series featured B&amp;M Okinawa, D-Stage, among others and where contestants from Asphalt Dancers, Athlete, TRICKERS and many more made their showing in an event of showmanship, enjoyable competition and camaraderie from those part of the drift scene of Okinawa. Despite the dreary weather, contestants and fans fellowshipped together all for the glory of going sideways bringing nothing but sunshine to the Bullring. Enjoy the photos and look out for the next event. -fameONE This slideshow requires JavaScript. 26.591546 127.977316 &rarr; 1 Comment Posted in Drifting Tagged AE86 , C33 , fameONE , Japan , JZX100 , Okinawa , RPS13 , S13 , S14 , S15 &larr; Older posts Search for: Recent Posts The ReturnHome RoyalPurple Roadblock Kojo&#8217;s Mean, CleanS15 Okinawa Super Drift Series: Mar.11 Archives June 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 Categories Drag Racing Drifting Garage Hard Parking Site News fameONE&#8217;s Twitter Feed Error: Twitter did not respond.
