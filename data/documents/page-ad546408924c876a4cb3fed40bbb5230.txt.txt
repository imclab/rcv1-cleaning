Overview Trims Options Specs Fuel Economy Safety Overview More power for these driver&#39;s cars. The Infiniti G35 sedan is one of the quickest, best handling cars in its class. It&#39;s a compelling choice for drivers who want the performance and handling of a true sports sedan for thousands less than the European benchmark cars. The G35 is also comfortable and practical, with a roomy back seat, a big trunk, and the trappings of a luxury car. Improved interiors, more power and other improvements enhance the 2005 models. The G35x AWD adds the stability of all-wheel drive and is an alternative to the Audi A4 quattro. The Infiniti G35 coupe is a true sports car or GT for the enthusiast driver. It&#39;s more luxurious, roomier and more practical than the Nissan 350Z, with a rear seat and more usable storage space. New Car Test Drive editor Mitch McCullough reports from California.
