Childish humor makes ‘Ice Age: Continental Drift’ appeal to only younger audiences  0comments  Posted on July 11, 2012  by  Bianca Montes Despite a cast of big names (Drake, Nicki Minaj, Ray Romano and Jennifer Lopez) Ice Age: Continental Drift fails to live up to other animations cruising into theaters. The film closely follows in its predecessors’ tracks with a child-friendly script that, unlike its following, fails to mature. Unlike other summer animations, such as Pixar’s Brave, this film was not made for all audiences. Those who started watching the series in 2002 would doubtfully find much funny or interesting about the almost recycled plot line. However, Continental Drift is perfect for children around the age of five, who will laugh and cheer along with the rapid outbursts of simple humor and accident-prone mishaps. The movie is once again centered around the ice age where a sabertooth tiger (Denis Leary, Ice Age: The Meltdown ), a goofy sloth (John Leguizamo, Moulin Rouge ) and a wooly mammoth (Ray Romano, “Everybody Loves Raymond”) set out on a sentimental journey of sorts. This time around, the trio is separated from their clan during a continental shift and have to take on the unruly ocean, and a few not-too-scary pirates, in an attempt to return to their land. While the movie does have a few highlights, including some spectacular visual work, the best and most memorable part comes in the form of funny woman Wanda Sykes ( Evan Almighty ) who plays Granny.  Sykes’s character is crude, feisty and one of the only reasons why a viewer over the age of 10 would not walk out of the theater. If anything, the film is worth it to watch the faces of your younger friends or family members light up at the almost touchable 3D action and giggle away at puerile humor.
