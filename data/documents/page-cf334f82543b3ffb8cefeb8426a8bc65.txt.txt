From cool-handed photographs of fashion spreads and magazine advertisements to beautiful white paintings that incorporate jokes and cartoons, this exhibition traces the career of a prominent 1980's appropriation artist, and gets better as it goes along. Through July 12. Also at the Whitney: "THE PAINTINGS OF GEORGE BELLOWS." Best known for his action-packed paintings of boxers, this early-20th-century American modernist painted landscapes, seascapes, portraits and New York street scenes with often astounding flair, in styles ranging from realistic to nearly visionary. This exhibition is the first thorough examination of his work in more than 35 years. Through Aug. 30. Hours: Thursdays, 1 to 8 P.M.; Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; closed Mondays and Tuesdays and July 4. Admission: $5; $3 for the elderly and students; free for children under 12; free for everyone on Thursdays, 6 to 8 P.M. Starting July 1, admission is $6 ($4 for the elderly and students). Information: (212) 570-3676. "ADRIAAN LUBBERS IN NEW YORK," Museum of the City of New York, Fifth Avenue at 103d Street, Manhattan. A Dutch artist who fell in love with New York and made it the central theme of his career, Lubbers (1892-1954) captured the spatial grandeur and the street-level tumult of the city in elegant lithographs and endearingly scruffy paintings. Through July 26. Hours: Wednesdays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Sundays, 1 to 5 P.M.; closed Mondays, Tuesdays and July 4. Open July 4. Admission: $5; $3 for children, students and the elderly; $8 for families. Information: (212) 534-1672. "STEP LIVELY: THE ART OF THE FOLK CANE," Museum of American Folk Art, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, Manhattan. Exhibitions that concentrate exclusively on one kind of object can have a wonderful intensity, as this show of 175 imaginatively hand-carved 19th- and 20th-century canes and walking sticks should easily demonstrate. Through Sept. 13. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M.; closed Mondays. Open July 4. Free. Information: (212) 977-7298. June 14 "LOUIS I. KAHN: IN THE REALM OF ARCHITECTURE," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan.

Hours: Thursdays, 11 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Fridays through Tuesdays, 11 A.M. to 5:45 P.M.; closed Wednesdays. Open July 4 and Labor Day.

June 26 "AN ENDURING INTEREST: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF ALEXANDER GARDNER," International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, Manhattan. The first retrospective of the Scottish-born photographer, known for his images of the Civil War, his portraits of Lincoln and his pictures of the hanging of the Lincoln conspirators (the only ones taken, and perhaps the world's first news photographs). He went on to take some of the earliest photographs of American Indians and of the building of the Union Pacific Railroad. June 26 through Sept. 6. Hours: Tuesdays, 11 A.M. to 8 P.M.; Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; closed Mondays. Admission: $3.50; $2 for students and the elderly.
