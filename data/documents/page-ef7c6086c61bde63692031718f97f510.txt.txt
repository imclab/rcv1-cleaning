So, here is an interesting one to ponderwhat car manufacturer has the best website? Not who makes the best carsbut who has the "coolest" or most "useful" automotive website. Again, this isn't who has the coolest blog or forumbut it's what manufacturer?

They're a lot slicker. "Not able to look at it on my iphone" isn't an excuse.&lt;/p&gt; Aaron Thursday 5/8, 2008 at 5:02 pm &lt;p&gt;In terms of what's provided on the website, i.e. company information, the background, racing history, etc. - the Aston Martin site is fairly in-depth and encompasses all that is Aston Martin. Plus it doesn't show you msrp prices right on the homepage, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I put Honda/Acura a close second only because it encompasses Honda as a whole, from cars, to bikes, to motors, etc.&lt;/p&gt; absolve Thursday 5/8, 2008 at 5:47 pm &lt;p&gt;skoda, for sure. The insufferable wait time: "Page loadingPlease wait!" shows a dominance over the consumer really attractive to the masochistic market.&lt;/p&gt; Ryan c|g staffer Friday 5/9, 2008 at 12:20 am &lt;p&gt;@ Jamie&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Slick" means nothing when the content isn't accessible by users with disabilities and search engines, not to mention plain unusable with normal browsing conventions. Flash is an animation software that was retrofitted to be used for websites after the fact. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's very hard to update or make changes to. The vast majority of developers dislike it, and avoid use at all costs aside from image rotators and the like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may have been cool to use in the late '90s, but with the advent of well-written scripts and code, you can have all the functionality of Flash but with real code and data, not an embedded movie.&lt;/p&gt; blix Friday 5/9, 2008 at 1:06 pm &lt;p&gt;i don't usually visit a lot of manufacturer websites. but when i do, i'm impressed with functionality over glitz. no music, no intros, no unnecessary videos that i have to encounter to get to the specs and interior/exterior galleries. i like a simple "build your car interface." that part i'm most interested in on such websites. all the other data i can pull off edmunds.&lt;/p&gt; jimbo Friday 5/9, 2008 at 1:31 pm &lt;p&gt;The VW site has a real nice vehicle configurator and I don't know if they still have it, but with the GIT you used to be able to build a car and then take it for a virtual test drive with some German doris named Helga along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt; Jeff c|g staffer Friday 5/9, 2008 at 10:01 pm &lt;p&gt;@Jimbo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That one probably isn't around anymore. It was part of the "Unpimp my ride" campaign a few years back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to think of any sites that really stand out, but the majority of the ones I go to are all clones of each other. I like the BMW site since it takes all the standard features and showcases them in a much cleaner design.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the Mini site comes to mind, but it's really showing it's age now. They haven't had any redesign since the first time I viewed it. The reason I mention it is because of a feature they had when they first previewed the vert. It's hard for me to describe in words to someone that hasn't seen it, but they experimented with a radical interface design. It was a little ahead of it's time in that it ran very sluggish on my machine that was fast in it's time. I do appreciate when the designers make that effort to innovate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, I was a fan of Scion's deviants website. It was a fun little site for what it was, but really didn't provide any info on the cars.&lt;/p&gt; Stef Monday 2/16, 2009 at 6:04 am &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#" onclick="return false;" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://thecarmarket.co.za&lt;/a&gt; is the best website guys&lt;/p&gt; Auto Forum and Community Wednesday 2/25, 2009 at 9:47 am &lt;p&gt;Good posting.Do u want to see &lt;a href="#" onclick="return false;" rel="nofollow"&gt;Auto Forum and Community&lt;/a&gt; ? u can visit my blog friend :D.ow yeah your blog has alread bookmarked by me&lt;/p&gt; Private Label Rights Saturday 7/25, 2009 at 12:01 am &lt;p&gt;Seems like a lot of people don't post here anymore&lt;/p&gt; Porsche Rims Monday 4/26, 2010 at 2:32 pm Hello guys! Thanks everybody for your valuable information and I picked this article, because I learned a lot from the site provided that talks about a new information product, I acquired it and I hope it solves my main problem and that is hybrid car making to contribute a bit to the environment and my budget as well.. &lt;a href="http://www.porschewheel.com/porsche-panamera-parts-porsche-panamera-wheels-c-185_186/18-porsche-panamera-wheels-rims-black-pr11-p-256"&gt;Porsche Rims&lt;/a&gt; windows dedicated server Wednesday 8/4, 2010 at 2:05 am im getting a car and im using a bunch of websites for research but how do i know which website is the best website to use?&lt;a href="http://www.mydediserver.com/windows-dedicated-server.php"&gt;windows dedicated server&lt;/a&gt; Jerry Monday 8/9, 2010 at 10:24 pm You may get it form the web search in search engine and each country one of car company will be best model of the year or forever and you may find out easily. &lt;a href="http://www.wheelsmustang.com"&gt;Mustang parts&lt;/a&gt; F150 Parts Monday 8/9, 2010 at 11:01 pm I think the trade in value is about 14 thousand but I owe twice that amount but I'm cool if I can get the cash... that is if I can't find anyone to take over my lease.

When you rent a car, you have to have full coverage on the care that you own your personal vehicle and then that will automatically carry over to the rental. If you do not have full coverage you can add it to your existing policy for the amount of time you'll be renting the car OR just buy the insurance from the rental place.&lt;a href="http://www.dailyinsurancereviews.com/"&gt;Insurance reviews&lt;/a&gt; jhon Thursday 9/2, 2010 at 1:40 pm Nice concerning as better as clarifying position.Gives Thanks for providing for us.I show your article with my delight. &lt;a href="http://car-mats-uk.com/"&gt;car mats&lt;/a&gt; Merdo Thursday 12/23, 2010 at 12:38 pm I would have to go with Audi. Certainly my top pick for best manufacturer website. Artistry is great...information is great...it's got the whole package. My close second would be either Lotus &lt;a href="http://www.inin.com/ProductSolutions/Pages/Enterprise-IP-Telephony.aspx"&gt;or&lt;/a&gt; Aston Martin. Aaron M M. Monday 1/10, 2011 at 2:27 am This is an interesting topic. I would most definetaley have to say Volvo Cars websites. I have always loved the sounds, the videos, and the graphics that goes along with pretty much every car. It offcourse even has the build your own Volvo feature with full rotation of the model and pretty fast response.
