They were fast, friendly and most importantly, affordable! This was the first time I had used US Automotive for repairs to my company van and I am so pleased I will use them for my personal vehicle as well! I will tell everyone I know to use US Automotive! THANKS GUYS! &#8221; Richard R. , Springfield MO &#8220; My husband does not quickly give compliments but he was very impressed with the communication, service, knowledge and staff at U S Automotive. We will definetly use your services again in the future for any needs that we might have. &#8221; Daisy M Willard, MO  <li> &#8220; When I brought my 1998 Chevy Caviler into US Automotive, I had a problem with getting my car to start. Not only did they figure out the cause of the problem (which they did so within an hour), they also got me an affordable rental for the two days I was going to be without a car. The people there did the work and after they finished they let me know that there is a 3 year-36,000 mile warranty on all parts and labor. How good is that? I have never found a shop that can guarantee their work for that long. I will always go back there to get even the smallest work done, because I know everyone will be honest and up front with me &#8221;<br />  <br />  <strong>Brandon</strong>Google Reviews </li> &#8220; Great business, they do all of my work on cars and I'm always happy with it! &#8221; Steele Google Reviews  <li> &#8220; Replaced my 2001 GMC engine with Jasper engine--just love the results! It's running smoother and quieter than the original. Terry's team really delivered with maximum performance and minimal down-time for my truck. But, I'm not surprised since this is typical of the type of service that I've always received from U.S. Automotive. From changing a light bulb to replacing and engine I've received nothing but superior service with outstanding customer service. I HIGHLY recommend Terry and his team of auto repair experts. &#8221;<br />  <strong>Ike</strong>, Customer Lobby Reviews </li> &#8220; Very pleased with their service! Will refer them to everyone! Other than repairing the obvious issues, they informed me of other standard future maintenances to consider. I do not like being inconvenienced with a broken vehicle. Whatever they say needs done gets done... By US AUTOMOTIVE! THANK-YOU Terry, Angle and Bryan! &#8221; Charles , Customer Lobby Reviews &#8220; ALL of our services we have had done on our vehicles have been done very fast with great results. Their preventative maintinance has kept our cars and truck going the miles they have without any major work. I would and have recommended them to everyone needing service done on their cars. &#8221; TM , Customer Lobby Reviews  <li> &#8220; U S Automotive were just very helpful. Twice, they stayed there for me past closing time, because I don't get off work until 5pm and they close at 5:30pm. I appreciated that they stayed late in order to help me out and then Angela gave me a ride over to the rental place.I am so lucky that a co-worker told me about them. I will definitely use them again. They are friendly, extremely helpful and willing to go above and beyond to make sure their customer is completely cared for. &#8221;<br /><br />  <strong>Elaine</strong>, Customer Lobby Reviews </li>  WEST SPRINGFIELD (417) 865-9511 (417) 865-BEEP (2337) 1753 S.
