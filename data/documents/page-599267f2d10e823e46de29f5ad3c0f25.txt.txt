No. To become Ford-certified, a pre-owned vehicle has to be less than six years old and have fewer than 80,000 miles on the odometer. It then has to pass a rigorous 172-point inspection. A CARFAX ® Vehicle History Report&#153; is also run to identify any vehicle that does not meet our strict standards. Who certifies these vehicles? Ford factory-trained dealer technicians go through each vehicle, performing a rigorous 172-point inspection, including obtaining a CARFAX ® Vehicle History Report.&#153; Any part(s) that doesn’t meet our standards is replaced with a factory-authorized part. For added peace of mind, each vehicle comes with comprehensive limited warranty coverage and powertrain limited warranty coverage backed by Ford Motor Company.* *See your dealer for warranty coverage details. Which areas are inspected during the 172-point inspection for Ford-Certified Pre-Owned vehicles? Vehicle history Road test Exterior/Interior appearance and condition Diagnostics Underhood/Underbody components Hybrid system Convenience features Why is a CARFAX ® Vehicle History Report&#153; so important? The CARFAX Vehicle History Report can identify identify any vehicle that does not meet our strict standards. The report is part of our 172-point inspection process, and it includes checks for: Flood vehicles Fire damage Frame damage Salvage vehicles Branded title Odometer issues Accident history Vehicle title history What happens when an item does not pass during the 172-point inspection? Any item(s) that does not meet Ford standards is repaired or replaced with a factory-authorized part(s). Can I get a Ford-Certified Pre-Owned vehicle from a non-Ford dealer? No. Only a Ford Motor Company-franchised Dealer can sell Ford-Certified Pre-Owned vehicles that were inspected and approved by Ford Motor Company standards.  Do Ford-Certified Pre-Owned vehicles come with warranty coverage? Yes, every Ford Certified Pre-Owned vehicle comes with a comprehensive limited warranty backed by Ford Motor Company covering more than 500 components for 12 months/12,000 miles* plus seven-year/100,000-mile powertrain limited warranty coverage. *See your dealer for warranty details. What areas are included in the comprehensive limited warranty? Engine Transmission Rear-wheel drive system Front-wheel drive system Steering components Brakes Front and rear suspension Electrical system Air conditioning and heating Technology components Emissions components Factory audio system Safety systems What's included in the powertrain warranty? Areas of coverage include the engine, transmission and more. If I sell my Ford-Certified Pre-Owned vehicle and the buyer wants to transfer warranty coverage, how much will it cost? It won’t cost the buyer a penny. Our manufacturer-backed limited warranty is fully transferable to future owners at no cost.  Why should I buy a Ford-Certified Pre-Owned vehicle? Ford Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) vehicles go through a rigorous172-point inspection process. Any item(s) that does not pass is replaced or repaired with a factory-authorized part.
