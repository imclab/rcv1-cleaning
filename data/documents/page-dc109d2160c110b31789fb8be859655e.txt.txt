Years later, Bauer reflects fondly on that first ride. “I bought it from my grandmother for $300,” he writes. “I was the one who had it painted ‘competition orange.’ &#8220;That is me standing next to it ready for the prom. My date’s father would not let her go in my car, so I had to drive his 1965 Buick.” Thanks for sharing your car and the memories with us, Dennis! Remember your first car?
