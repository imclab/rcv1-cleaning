The Infiniti IPL G Coupe's unique exterior includes a dramatic front and rear bumper/fascia design with integrated fog lights and black finishers, sculpted side sills, rear spoiler and chrome exhaust tips. Each part is shaped to accent the G Coupe's aggressively seductive styling. Combined with the exclusive 19-inch IPL split 7-spoke graphite-finish wheels and low-profile W-rated Bridgestone Potenza RE50A performance tires, the Infiniti IPL G Coupe projects a confident stance and road-ready attitude. The Infiniti IPL G Coupe is offered in just two exterior colors: Graphite Shadow and Malbec Black. The Infiniti IPL G Coupe interior is designed to harmonize with the exterior styling, offering two color treatments - Graphite and Monaco Red (red interior only available with the Malbec Black exterior and 7-speed automatic transmission). All Infiniti IPL G Coupe interiors include red-stitched leather-appointed front sport seats with manual thigh extension and driver's power torso and thigh support adjustment, red-stitched steering wheel, Silk Obi aluminum trim, and aluminum pedals and footrest. Other standard interior features include Infiniti Studio on Wheels by Bose&#174; premium audio system, Infiniti Hard Drive Navigation System, 9.3GB Music Box&#174; Hard Drive, Infiniti Voice Recognition for audio navigation, memory system for driver's seat, steering wheel and outside mirrors, RearView Monitor, Rear Sonar and moonroof (these items are optionally available on non-IPL G Coupe models). The Infiniti IPL G Coupe's enhanced performance comes from the synergetic effects of three technology areas - engine tuning, dynamic tuning and sound quality/acceleration feel tuning. Engine performance modifications were selected not only for increased horsepower and torque levels, but also for acceleration feel and exhaust sound without compromising fuel economy or noise standards. The IPL-tuned high-flow exhaust is a full dual exhaust design with independent left and right large diameter pipes. The muffler's inner structure and materials have been maximized to reduce pressure and provide an appropriate performance exhaust note. The result is a 30% reduction in exhaust pressure versus a base G Coupe's Y-pipe exhaust system design. The Infiniti IPL G Coupe's advanced VQ37HR 3.7-liter V6 engine management system has been recalibrated through air-fuel mixture and ignition timing optimization, raising the maximum horsepower output point to 7,400 rpm (from 7,000 rpm). To obtain a natural acceleration feel, the torque curve from low revs to the maximum torque point (5,200 rpm) was tuned for linearity. As a result of both the exhaust system and engine management changes, the Infiniti IPL G Coupe generates 348 horsepower - an increase of 18 horsepower over the non-IPL models - and 276 lb-ft of torque (+6 lb-ft). "When you drive the Infiniti IPL G Coupe, the first thing you notice is the surge in sound and acceleration feel. The inspiring swell of sound is in complete harmony with the acceleration feel as engine speed increases," said Poore. "The sound is clean and inspiring, adding to the fun-to-drive sensation provided by the 348 horsepower under the hood." Equally inspiring is the Infiniti IPL G Coupe's dynamic vehicle performance, which focuses on providing confident handling, flat ride and smooth ride comfort. The IPL suspension tuning and damping management philosophy is designed to optimize each aspect of the suspension, effectively connecting the driver to the road surface while removing uncomfortable vibrations. Front spring rates have been increased 20% over the base G Coupe and rear spring rates increased 10%. Shock tuning has also been adjusted to reach a new premium performance standard. The Infiniti IPL G Coupe also offers a sport-tuned steering gear and large 4-wheel sport brakes with aluminum-alloy opposed calipers (4-piston front/2-piston rear) and Viscous Limited-Slip Differential (VLSD). Infiniti Performance Line Infiniti announced its rumored specialty-performance vehicle collection, the Infiniti Performance Line&#8482;. The first production vehicle from this group, the 348-horsepower 2011 Infiniti Performance Line G Coupe, debuts at an exclusive event at the 60th annual Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. It joins the Infiniti line of performance luxury vehicles at Infiniti retailers nationwide in December 2010. The Infiniti Performance Line, or IPL, offers a new level of premium performance for Infiniti vehicles, focusing not just on engine power and acceleration, but also on redefining total vehicle performance. IPL promises unique driving attributes with exclusive designs, different from other Infiniti models in each selected Infiniti line. The 2011 IPL G Coupe is the first of what is expected to be a range of IPL performance vehicles in the future. Infiniti Performance Line vehicles are targeted at buyers seeking performance luxury vehicles that express a greater degree of individual style. The limited production IPL vehicles begin with Infiniti's legendary emotional design and Japanese craftsmanship - and then heighten the luxury and performance levels through modifications to the exterior, interior, engine tuning and suspension. "IPL was conceived to create a new premium performance envelope, going beyond equipment upgrades to accelerate the very soul of Infiniti's Inspired Performance," said Infiniti Vice President Ben Poore. "IPL brings all the elements together, styling harmonized with performance, exhaust note with acceleration feel, ride comfort and confident handling. It's the perfect formula for unmatched driving exhilaration." IPL models will be identified by a special engine cover and trunklid badging. The IPL emblem is designed to reinforce the strong message and spirit of IPL. The letter "I" features a red insert representing sporty spirit, while the Infiniti-violet "shadow" behind the letter appears like an Infiniti flag to indicate the brand's Inspired Performance promise.
