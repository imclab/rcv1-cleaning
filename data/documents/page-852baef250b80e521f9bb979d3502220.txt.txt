Our auto wiring features a smooth surface finish and is resistant to moisture, grease, oil, gasoline, most acids and solvents. It’s typically used in high temperature areas, such as engine compartments. Our cross-link wire meets SAE J1128 standards and is designed for applications where higher heat resistance is required. It’s offered in standard wall to extra thin wall insulation for space and weight reduction.  1-12of208  10GA GXL BLACK AUTOMOTIVE WIRE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL10-0 U/M: FEET Avail: 81000.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.3457 Qty: 10GA GXL BROWN AUTOMOTIVE WIRE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL10-1 U/M: FEET Avail: 3250.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.3457 Qty: 10GA GXL RED AUTOMOTIVE WIRE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL10-2 U/M: FEET Avail: 48134.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.3457 Qty: 10GA GXL ORANGE AUTOMOTIVE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL10-3 U/M: FEET Avail: 16247.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.3457 Qty: 10GA GXL YELLOW AUTOMOTIVE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL10-4 U/M: FEET Avail: 12600.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.3457 Qty: 10GA GXL GREEN AUTOMOTIVE WIRE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL10-5 U/M: FEET Avail: 8250.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.3457 Qty: 10GA GXL BLUE AUTOMOTIVE WIRE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL10-6 U/M: FEET Avail: 2250.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.3457 Qty: 10GA GRAY AUTOMOTIVE WIRE GXL CROSS-LINKED WIRE Item #: WL10-8 U/M: FEET Avail: 6250.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.3457 Qty: 10GA GXL WHITE AUTOMOTIVE WIRE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL10-9 U/M: FEET Avail: 22830.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.3457 Qty: 12GA GXL BLACK AUTOMOTIVE WIRE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL12-0 U/M: FEET Avail: 175750.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.2178 Qty: 12GA GXL BROWN AUTOMOTIVE WIRE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL12-1 U/M: FEET Avail: 12760.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.2178 Qty: 12GA GXL TAN AUTOMOTIVE WIRE CROSS-LINKED XLPE WIRE Item #: WL12-11 U/M: FEET Avail: 5250.00 Catalog Page  $ 0.2178 Qty:  1-12of208  S2K Commerce - Order Entry - Products Dropdown Menu     Products &#9660; Packard Connectors Ring Terminals Fuse Holders Automotive Relays More Products Ordering Information &#9660; Quick Order How to Order Track Orders View Payment History Saved Carts Supply List Order From History Customer Service &#9660; FAQs Contact Us Order Help Terms of Use Request Catalog Request Quote Privacy Policy About Us &#9660; Company Info History Quality News News &#9660;  /wps/portal/en/products Automotive Cross Link Wire | GXL, TXL, and SXL Wire | Waytek, Inc - Page 1 of 18 Z6_9R1AGKG10GRGF0I95R9CO41005 /Ordering Portal /Products This is responsible for bootstrapping the configuration for the javascript framework.
