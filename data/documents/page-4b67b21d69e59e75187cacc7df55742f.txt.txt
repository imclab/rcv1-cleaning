We just have got hold of new information which BMW has recently released regarding 1-series M coupe. The info includes engine information, release dates, and the toys for bad boys it will carry. Under the hood of this metallic beauty, rests a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six with 340 horsepower. The engine is mated to six-speed manual transmission. This car only comes with a manual transmission. That motor should be more than enough to haul around the carÂ&rsquo;s 3,307-pound weight. Exterior: It was 1988 BMW M3 Sport Evolution that has inspired to build the 1-series M coupe model. Surprisingly, this coupe is 1.3 inches longer than the M3. Just like the M-models before it, this car has been built with one aim; and that is to look more muscular and aggressive in all dimensions. And BMW has done a great job in fulfilling this act; this coupe features 3 large air intakes, large wheel arches, accompanied with a chrome grill element bearing the M logo and exterior mirrors just like the M3 version. To add more to the sportier look, the car features a discreet spoiler on the luggage compartment and two sets of chromes plated tail-pipes that are both placed towards the outer edge. This beauty rides on 19-inch wheels in Y-spoke design. A treat for the eyes are the colors in which this 1-series will be offered: Alpine White, Black Sapphire Metallic and Valencia Orange Metallic. Interior: We donÂ&rsquo;t have to tell you people about the interior, since itÂ&rsquo;s a BMW, it will definitely be up to the standards. But donÂ&rsquo;t worry, we got the interior covered. The moment you lay your eyes on the inside world, you are immediately taken by surprise by the awesome interior, like the dark Alcantara that is beautifully contrasted by the use of orange stitching covering the door panels, door pulls, instrument cluster binnacle, dash panel, and gearshift and handbrake lever boots. The sporty seats are dressed in Boston leather with orange contrasting stitching and an M logo embossed in the front of each headrest, while the leather M multifunction steering wheel features the now-ubiquitous M Button for spontaneous activation of the sharpest throttle response and M Dynamic Mode of DSC. Performance: When you lift the hood, you will be welcomed by a new twin-turbocharged, all-aluminum, 3.0-liter inline-6 engine that is capable of delivering an impressive 335 HP at 5,900 rpm and 332 lb-ft of torque from 1,500 rpm to 4,500 rpm. The engine is mated to a close ratio 6-speed manual transmission. BMW has announced that this metallic blaze can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 4.7 seconds, and yes, top speed is still electronically limited to 155 mph. The standing quarter-mile mark comes up in 13.2 seconds. We also saw the 2011 BMW 1-Series M Coupe already setting its mark at the Nurburgring. Eagerly doing its best in terms of performance, on the test laps to determine its official Â&rsquo;Ring lap time. The 2011 1-Series Coupe just finished its date around the Â&rsquo;Ring, clocking in a time of 8:12, which is about 10 seconds faster than the E46 M3.
