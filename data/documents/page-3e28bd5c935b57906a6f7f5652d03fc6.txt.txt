 American Cultural History 
  1920 - 1929 
 T he purpose of this web/library guide is to help the user gain a broad understanding of the  Roaring 1920s .&nbsp;  In a&nbsp;  very small  way, this is a bibliographic essay. While there is no way we can link to everything, we have attempted to find areas of special interest and to select information that we hold dear today, for example books we love - movies we watch - songs we sing - events we find interesting - people we admire.   
 T o see the whole picture, we encourage users to browse all the way through this page (and the other decades)&nbsp; and  then  visit the suggested links.&nbsp; We think the best way to immerse oneself in a period of time is to use both Internet and the library. Some information is best viewed or read in books. Books are where real depth of information can be found. Then, there is information that will be found  only  on the Internet. or that is 'byte' size and easily and quickly viewed on the Web. If you can add a valuable site or information to this page, we invite you to  write .

 ART &amp; 
ARCHITECTURE 
 Early 
  modernism in art, design, and architecture , which began at the turn of the 
  century, continued through to 1940 and the war.&nbsp;In cities,  Skyscrapers  (first in 1870s) were erected 
  and hundreds of architects competed for the work. The first successful design 
  was the  Woolworth Building   in New York.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Chicago, the  Wrigley 
  building  was designed by  Graham, Anderson, Probst, and White  while the  Chicago 
  Tribune Tower  was designed by Howells and Hood.&nbsp; The  Art 
  Deco design  was exemplified by the  Chrysler 
   and  Empire 
  State Building s (depression projects - the Empire State Building completed 
  early 1931.)  Frank Lloyd 
  Wright  was prolific during this period, designing homes in California and 
  in Japan.&nbsp; The term  Art Deco  (1925-1950) 
  is derived from the  International 
  Art Exposition in Paris  in 1925.&nbsp; In the 20s and 30s art of that style 
  was referred to as modern.&nbsp; Designers included  Karl 
  (Kem) Weber  and  Eliel 
  Saarinen .   
 Art movements included the  modernist 
  movement  [ George 
  Luks ,  Charles 
  W. Hawthorne ],  abstract 
  expressionism  [ Willem 
  de Kooning ],  
  surrealism,  
  and 
   dadaism  [ Georgia 
  O'Keeffe ,  Morgan 
  Russell ,  Man Ray ],&nbsp; 
   realism  [ 
   Thomas 
  Hart Benton ,  Edward 
  Hopper ,  Grant 
  Wood ,  Leon 
  Kroll ] and landscape [ Aldro 
  Thompson Hibbard ,  N.C. Wyeth ].&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   Horace Pippin  is 
  considered one of America's foremost primitive or naive painters.&nbsp; The 
  best museums featured shows by these important artists.

 BOOKS &amp; LITERATURE 
 
 Following 
WWI (the war to end all wars), talented young authors, some expatriates in France, 
wrote about their feelings of disillusionment and alienation. A sense of rebellion 
developed and the victorian idea of decency was considered hypocritical.&nbsp; Writers began to write frankly about sexuality. Three important groups during 
this period were: 
 &nbsp; The 
  Algonquin Round Table , also called THE ROUND TABLE, informal group of American 
  literary men and women who met daily for lunch on weekdays at a large round 
  table in the  Algonquin 
  Hotel in New York City  during the 1920s and '30s. Many of the best-known 
  writers, journalists, and artists in New York City were in this group. Among 
  them&nbsp;&nbsp; were  Dorothy Parker , 
   Alexander 
  Woollcott  (author of the quote "All the things I really like are immoral, 
  illegal, or fattening",  Heywood 
  Broun ,  Robert Benchley , Robert 
  Sherwood ,  George 
  S. Kaufman ,  Franklin P. Adams ,  Marc 
  Connelly ,  Harold Ross ,  Harpo Marx , 
  and  Russell Crouse.

 Razors pain 
              you; Rivers are damp;   
 Acids stain you; And drugs cause cramp. 
 
 Guns aren't lawful; Nooses give; 
 
 Gas smells awful; You might as well 
              live.

 Harlem 
Renaissance  is considered the first important movement of  
black artists and writers  in the US.&nbsp; Centered in  Harlem, 
NY,  and other urban areas during the 1920s, black writers published more than 
ever before.&nbsp; Influential and lasting black authors, artists, and musicians 
received their first serious critical appraisal.&nbsp; This group included  
Zora Neale Hurston ,  W.E.B. 
DuBois ,  Langston Hughes , 
 Jean Toomer , 
and  Alain Locke  
, who was considered the chief interpreter for the  Harlem 
movement .

 The  Lost 
Generation,  the self-exiled expatriates who lived and wrote in Paris between 
the wars.&nbsp; These writers, looking for freedom of thought and action, changed 
the face of modern writing.&nbsp; Realistic and rebellious, they wrote what they 
wanted and fought censorship for profanity and sexuality.&nbsp; They incorporated 
Freudian ideas into their characters and styles.&nbsp; This group included  Ernest 
Hemingway ,  Gertrude 
Stein ,  John 
Dos Passos ,  Henry 
Miller,   F. Scott Fitzgerald.

 Others who were important during 
this decade include  e. 
e. cummings  experimented with language (and punctuation!),&nbsp;  William 
Faulkner  was an important part of the  Southern 
Renaissance ,&nbsp;  
Edna St. Vincent Millay  expressed the defiance and desires of her generation 
from  Greenwich 
Village , and  Eugene 
O'Neill  drew attention to a serious American stage.&nbsp; AND, we can't leave 
out the beginning of the  Golden Age of Mysteries.   and introducing America's own contribution to the mystery novel, the  hard-boiled, 
with writers such  as  Raymond 
Chandler  and  Dashielle Hammett  
and paving the way for the future. 
 
 
 i carry your heart with me(i carry it in
my heart)i am never without it(anywhere
i go you go,my dear; and whatever is done
by only me is your doing,my darling)
i fear
no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want
no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)
and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant
and whatever a sun will always sing is you

here is the deepest secret nobody knows
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows
higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart

i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)

 Costumes / Fashion 
 
 
 Men: Clothing for men became a bit more conservative 
  in the  1920s .&nbsp; Trousers widened to as wide as 24 inches at the bottomes.&nbsp;  Knickers  grew in width and length and were called 'plus fours'.&nbsp;  White 
  linen  was popular during the summer.&nbsp; And during the winter, an outstanding 
  American coat was popular -  the racoon coat .&nbsp; These were very popular with 
  the college men. The slouch hat was made of felt and could be rolled up and 
  packed into a suitcase. A wool suit was only $15.85. Garters were 40 cents. 
  All this and a 12" long cigarette holder. Cigarettes were 10 cents a pack. 
 Women:&nbsp;  By 1921 the longer skirt was back - some long and uneven at the bottom.&nbsp; 
  The short skirt was popular by 1925.&nbsp; This period was called the  Flapper 
  Age .&nbsp; No bosom, no waistline, and hair nearly hidden under a cloche 
  hat.&nbsp; This decade began the present hey-dey for the  manufacturing 
  of cosmetics .&nbsp; Powder, lipstick, rouge, eyebrow pencil, eye shadow, 
  colored nails.&nbsp; They had it all!&nbsp; AND pearls.   
 This period marked the spread 
  of  ready-to-wear fashion .&nbsp; 
  More women were wage earners and did not want to spent time on fittings.&nbsp; 
  The status symbol aspect of fashion was losing its importants as class distinctions 
  were becoming blurred.&nbsp; Inexpensive fashion became available.&nbsp; America 
  moved ahead of other countries&nbsp; mass production of contemporary style clothing 
  for women.&nbsp; America even produced several designers of this fashion including 
  Jane Derby.

   HISTORIC 
    EVENTS AND PEOPLE 
 
 Thanks to  Henry 
Ford  and mass production, one could buy a ford for $290.&nbsp; The  Volstead 
Act  became effective Jan 16, 1920 and made the sale of a drink  containing 
as much as one half-ounce of alcohol unlawful. This one unsuccessful act brought 
about much of the flavor of the Jazz Age or Roaring Twenties as we know them. 
This was a period of&nbsp;  prohibition 
and intolerance , speakeasies, flappers,  gangsters , 
and crime. Hootch was supplied by  Dutch 
Schultz  and  Al 
Capone .&nbsp; The  Nineteenth 
Amendment  had passed the previous year allowing women the right to vote in 
national elections.&nbsp; At the beginning of the decade the US was paralyzed 
by the grip of the  red 
scare  . Racial tensions were high and quotas were set for  immigrants  
coming into America. The  
Ku Klux Klan  was very active during this period. The decade was a wonderful one for 
all of the arts and literature in America.  Technology 
grew  - the country shrunk - as popularity of automobiles, radios, and movies 
exploded. Buying on credit or  installments 
 was an outcome of the industrial age. In the fall of 1929, the  New 
York Stock Exchange  was more active than it had ever been. Economists predicted 
a permanent high plateau. By October 24, 1929,  Black 
Thursday,  the  stock 
market crashed  and panic broke out. Banks closed. The nation stayed in this  
depression  through the end of the twenties and most of the thirties.&nbsp; Check out the  Regulatory environment 
of the 1920s . 
 
 During this decade, Presidents 
  were   
 1913-1920  
  Woodrow Wilson  | 1921-1923  Warren 
  G. Harding   
 | 1923-1928  Calvin 
  Coolidge | 1928-1932

   MUSIC 
    of the Twenties 
 
 
 Every mornin', every 
  evenin'   
 Ain't we got fun? 
 
 Not much money, oh but honey' 
 
 Ain't we got fun? 
 
 
 "There's nothing surer; the rich 
get rich and the poor get poorer." was considered the credo of the roaring 20s.&nbsp; Chicago 
was hot!&nbsp;   Harlem  was hot with Jazz and the so-called &quot;devil's music'! ( The 
Cotton Club  was open to both whites and blacks and packed nightly.)&nbsp; Jazz was hot!  Bessie 
Smith sang the Blues . But most of the best-selling pop hits were sentimental 
ballads ( I'll Be 
With You in Apple Blossom Time  and  I'm 
Just Wild About Harry ), old-fashioned walzes ( Three 
O'Clock in the Morning  and  Deep 
in My Heart ) , and nonsense songs ( Yes, 
We Have No Bananas  and  I 
Wish That I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate ).&nbsp;  Fanny 
Brice  sang  Rose 
of Washington Square  and  Second 
Hand Rose i n the  Ziegfeld Follies 
 and  
Vaudeville. &nbsp; The&nbsp;  Grand 
Ole Opry  was transmitted on the radio from Nashville in 1925. 
 Al 
Jolson sang his wonderful songs . 
 
 People were going 
  places and singing about them;  Chicago; 
  That Toddling Town ,&nbsp;  
  Carolina in the Morning ,  Way 
  Down Yonder in New Orleans ,  California 
  Here I Come (love YouTube) ,  Alabamy 
  Bound , and&nbsp;  Puttin' 
  on the Ritz by Irving Berlin.  (featuring Clark Gable. Try the other versions, I just love Young Frankenstein.
