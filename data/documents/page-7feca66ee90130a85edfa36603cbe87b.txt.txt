Photo credit: Sue Miller Each spring, the BAFFA Art Gallery hosts three student art exhibits beginning with the selected artwork of students in the Sayville and Bayport elementary Schools followed by middle school students. BAFFA Board Member Ellen Stoll manages the educational exhibits at the gallery and assists the teachers with the hanging of the art work at the gallery. The student shows culminate with the high school invitational juried exhibit. This exhibit expands beyond local boundaries, in that it includes artwork from high school students from up to ten school districts on Long Island. All of the artwork submitted is selected by the art teachers. Participating district high schools in this year's event were: Bellport, Brentwood, Connetquot, Longwood, Patchogue-Medford, Sachem East, Sachem North, Sayville and William Floyd. Each art entry is identified by only a number and is entered in a specific artistic category. A panel of judges, selected for their expertise in various media, independently view and determine their choices for first, second, third and honorable mention in the specific categories. Scorers then tally the judges' results and pin the appropriate ribbons next to the numbered winning works of art. BAFFA also offers a ribbon for Best in Show as well as the prestigious Jacqueline Carling Palmer Award, a monetary award given to a graduating high school senior applicant by the Palmer Family in memory of former BAFFA Board Member Jacqueline C. Palmer. A brochure noting the entry numbers, students' names and results was distributed to all who attended the week-long event. The BAFFA Art Gallery was all a-buzz on Sunday afternoon, April 29th as students, parents and friends visited the Artists' Reception, eager to view the entries and see what the judges had thought about their work. Brentwood High School Senior Christopher Castrillion proved to be the 2013 overall winner by capturing a blue ribbon for Best in Show as well as the Palmer Award for his oil painting &quot;Still Life with Grapes&quot;. Castrillion, who enjoyed drawing as a youngster, only began working with acrylics and oils three years ago. His favorite artists are from the Surrealism Art Movement and include Dali (he plans to visit the Dali Museum in Florida following graduation) and also the witty and thought-provoking Belgian Painter, Rene Magritte. Janet Velasquez, Brentwood Art Director for Grades K-12 attended the exhibit and stated, &quot;We are very proud of Chris! He is an exemplary student and a stellar example of what an arts education that begins in Kindergarten can do. Of course, Chris' talent speaks for itself, but his accomplishments wouldn't be possible without the dedication of his art teachers. Currently, Chris is enrolled in AP 2A Studio with Ms. Kristin Grossi and Painting with Mr. Howard Block, both amazing Arts Educators. We want to sincerely thank BAFFA for the opportunity to exhibit and celebrate our students' talents.&quot; Castrillion plans to begin college this September where he will major in bio-chemistry and minor in visual arts. He then plans to continue his education by attending medical school. Carole Sheppard Two high School senior applicants were selected to receive a monetary award presented by Women Sharing Art, Inc. at the BAFFA Student Invitational Art Exhibit. The award is given by WSA to a graduating female who will attend art school and/or be enrolled in a college art program. The decision was based on the students' portfolio and mission statement. The 2013 WSA award winners are Sayville High School senior Meagan Mulry (left) and Sachem High School East Campus senior Alissa Naer. Meagan's award winning entry in the Drawing/Pastel Category entitled &quot;Head Rush&quot;, also received a 3rd Place Ribbon from the BAFFA judges in that category. Alissa's entry entitled &quot;Multiple Personality Disorder&quot; received Honorable Mention in the Mixed Media category. Congratulations to both Meagan and Alissa.

As a child, Jane spent her summers at the UsdanCenter For the Creative and Performing Arts, and is a recipient of their distinguished alumna award. She and her husband, Rick Montalbano, currently serve on the Usdan Leadership Council. Jane graduated with honors from the Manhattan School of Music in 1999, earning a BA in music and receiving the William H.Borden Award for outstanding accomplishment in Jazz. As a finalist in the 1998 Thelonious Monk Jazz Institute's vocal competition, she was first runner-up to Teri Thornton. An extraordinarily gifted jazz vocalist whose sincere and romantic interpretations of exceptional songs has made her a favorite in both the jazz and cabaret worlds, Monheit has garnered numerous accolades in the past decade. Her first album, Never Never Land, was voted top debut recording by the Jazz Journalist's Association and stayed on the Billboard Jazz chart for over a year. Subsequent albums either charted high, or in several cases, debuted at number one, and yielded two Grammy nominations in the Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocals category, recognizing the work of Vince Mendoza on 2002's In The Sun and 2004'sTaking A Chance On Love. An international artist, Jane has performed at most of the major concert halls, cabarets and jazz venues around the globe. She has released eight albums and two DVDs, and has appeared as a guest artist on many others. She appears on the sound tracks of the movies Sky Captain and the World Of Tomorrow and Never let Me Go. Jane has also been a featured performer in the nationally televised Christmas at the White House, the Capitol Fourth of July Celebration, and The National Memorial Day Celebration. Jane spends most of the year on tour with her band which currently includes Michael Kanan on piano, Neal Miner on bass, and Rick Montalbano on drums. She also performs with the major symphonic orchestras throughout the country.

John DiNaro is a full-time sculptor and muralist on Long Island, practicing his art since the 1950's. &ldquo;My work began almost as far back as I can remember. I was always doodling and daydreaming. I had the ability to turn my body into energy and become the daydream. My image was a horse with an eagle on its back. This image has carried through to my adult years and is the spirit which is the theme throughout many of my works.&rdquo;He feels hisartwork is not created for ego or fame, but to help elevate the artist to a higher spiritual level.Â  He has been teaching Arts in Education at both Nassau and Suffolk BOCES for the past 25 years. John is currently involved with the Youth at Risk Program at the Cornell Cooperative in Suffolk County. http://www.bellport.com/horseandeagle/ Adel Gorgy is a Long Island artist whose photographs have been exhibited both nationally and internationally in museums and galleries.Â  He creates large, complex works, woven into single, harmonious compositions.Â  Photography has been Adel's lifelong way of sharpening observation, bringing vision to a focus, and heightening awareness.Â  &ldquo;Amidst the order and chaos in our world,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;my eyes see always beauty, and my work is a window to my world.&rdquo; www.adelgorgy.com Robert Mielenhausen is a Long Island artist.Â  He has been creating art for the past 45 years.Â  The artist attended the New York Institute of Technology and Adelphi University.Â  His art resides in the collections of private individuals as well as corporate and educational institutions.Â  Exhibitions include OK Harris Works of Art, NY; Â Onward Gallery, Tokyo, Japan; Â Architectural Digest Home &amp; Design Show; Â and at Viridian Artists, NY.Â  The artist has had over 20 solo exhibitions.Â  http://robertmielenhausen.com/ Daniel O'Keefe: Â  Emotion in Layers â¦..Although O&rsquo;Keefe&rsquo;s abstractions are at first glance similar with those of his contemporary, Gerhard Richter, they are in reality quite different. Richter's abstractions are produced by &ldquo;pulling the paint in emotionless paths over the canvas,&rdquo; with the purpose of being &ldquo;gestural without being expressive.&rdquo; O&rsquo;Keefe&rsquo;s layered and scraped abstractions are not only gestural and expressive but born from a deeply emotional source that expose layers of tragedy, joy, and rebirth. His life story shows how &ldquo;scraping the surface&rdquo; can capture more than just our cursory attention.For a complete bio visit http://artconvergence.com/Collection/Show/22 Sharon Way-Howard is an elected member of the Salmagundi Club in NYC, where she was the 1st woman Art Chair in their 135 years &amp; is currently 3rd V.P.

There will be a reception open to the public on October 1, 2011 from 1 to 4 pm . Admission is free. Adel Gorgyâs large-scale images are all derived from nature and span a time from Winter to Fall. Realism describes nature, Impressionism colors it, Expressionism interprets it and Abstraction reduces it. In Rhythms...Winter to Fall, these boundaries are blurred, imaginary or non-existent. In another group of works, Againâ¦Seeing Art Anew, he employs selected visual phrases taken from great paintings as the basis for new compositions, interpreting and recomposing revered works of art. Gorgyâs images are large, complex works, woven into a single, harmonious composition. In photographs of sunrises, called Horizon in Time, he minimizes and recomposes colors and patterns in the movement of water and skyscapes. Through his work, the artist invites viewers to seek new ways of seeing. âIn the end,â he says, âthe medium, the technique and the style fall behind or disappear, and only the image remains.â Adel Gorgy lives and works on Long Island and his photographs have been exhibited both nationally and internationally in museums and galleries.
