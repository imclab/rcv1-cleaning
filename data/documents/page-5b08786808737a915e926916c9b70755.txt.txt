 CAR CULTURE AND THE LANDSCAPE OFSUBTRACTION В В В В В В В В В В В  Thehit foreign film of the late 1980В’s, Cinema Paradiso, provides amarvelous metaphor for our current international predicament. В  The movie wonderfully demonstrates how ourcollective obsession with automobiles has savaged our cities and diminished oursense of place and community. В  Thecentral character within the movie is the В”ParadisoВ” cinema, located on agenerous piazza В  in a small townin Sicily. В  The movie house, along withthe church, provide, not only the dominant architectural features of the piazza ,but also provide the heart and soul, respectively, of the community. В  The piazza В  of 1954 existed as the hierarchical gathering space for thetown, with its open market, cultural festivals, and even an outdoor moviescreening space. В  In the movie, peoplecontinually traverse the space by foot, bicycle, and horse-drawn cart. В  Upon the protagonists return to the town inthe 1980В’s, the once glorious urban space had been usurped by modernprogress. В  Pedestrians are scarce ascars speed across the piazza В  dodging the multitude of parked vehicles. В  The former projectionist, turned famous movie director, appearsdevastated to see the В”ParadisoВ” condemned for demolition, only to be replacedwith a parking lot. В  In the final scene,we see the theater blasted to smithereens in the background, the weepingnostalgic crowds in the middle ground, and, in the foreground, the rooftops ofFiats and Volkswagons. В В В В В В В В В В В  Althoughthe film ostensibly presents a general critique of modern industrial society,in the forefront is the burgeoning obsession with the machina . В  The Sicilian townВ’s identity and sense ofcommunity was lost with the compromise of the piazza .. В  Crucial public space had been handed over,free of charge, to the priviledged few who could afford an automobile. В  Unfortunately, this is the typical state ofaffairs in AmericaВ’s cities. В  This(de)evolution in transportation was not a natural progression. В  The rise of the automobileВ’s popularity wasgreatly encouraged by obstinate politicians and profit-motivatedcorporations. В  Additionally, thecomplicity of modernist urban planners and architects, dehumanized trafficengineers, and demagogue developers cannot be ignored. В  Their collective post-war creation has leftus with a mountain of debt, a sprawling suburban ooze, polluted and crumblinginner cities, and a landscape devoid of farmland and forests. В  All in all, ours is the landscape ofsubtraction. В  Cars have contributednothing to our urban condition, our communities, and our environment. В  They have only taken away. В  What started out as a promise for a betterlife based on unlimited mobility, has become a modern day obsession, assolitary commuters idle in endless traffic jams wondering where all of the carscame from. INDOCTRINATING THE COMPROMISE OF PUBLICSPACE В В В В В В В В В В В  Owningand driving an automobile has become a prerequisite for conformity in ourpopular culture. В  To not drive inAmerica is seen as aberrant behavior. В  Using mass transit is for people too poor to own an automobile, or forbig city dwellers who deem the auto commute inefficient. В  Riding a bicycle is seen as either arecreational act, or only as a method for children and pre-teens to getaround. В  Walking on a country road or asuburban strip, where seldom doth a sidewalk appear, immediately elicitssuspicion. В  Surely only a lunatic ora criminal would do such a thing. В  In the land of apple pie, every В”normalВ” citizen gets around bycar. В  After World War II, buying asuburban bungalow was even considered a patriotic act. В  William Levitt, the Long Island developerfor whom Levittown was named said, В”The suburban homeowner could never be acommunist . . . He has too much to do!В” В  The aphorisms, В”no one messes with a manВ’s set of wheelsВ”, or В”whatВ’sgood for GM is good for AmericaВ” has incredible power in our culture. В В В В В В В В В В В  Theindoctrination into our auto-dominated culture begins at very early age. В  Children play with toy cars and trucks. В  They build miniature suburbs with Tonkatrucks and cranes. В  Every Barbie doll orG.I. Joe figurine needs the accompanying vehicle to be a complete set. В  Many childrenВ’s toy vehicles are ornamentedto appear like cars, even though mechanically, they are similar tobicycles. В  Many young boys buildminiature race tracks of plastic, emulating the stock-car racers seen on T.V. В  By the time these children become teenagers,they will have their sights set on that 16th birthday with the driverВ’s licensesoon to follow. В  Who can blamethem? В  With many living in suburbsspread so thinly, bicycle trips become impractical, and mass transit isnon-existent. В  Those priviledged enough,will receive a car from their parents as a gift. В  Most others though, will need to work to support their new, usedcars. В  Surely, some will argue that theyneed a car to get to work... so that they can have money in order to maintaintheir cars... so that they can get to work...etc. В В В В В В В В В В В  Fromthere, oneВ’s adult life becomes a constant barrage of images to reinforce theВ”normalcyВ” of car ownership and use. В  Psychological reinforcement comes heavily from our media sources. В  One third of all T.V. advertisements are forautomobiles and a great deal of newspaper space, including the weeklyВ”automotive sectionВ”, is appropriated to present images, statistics, andcommentary based on cars. В  Thisprohibits a reasonable debate on our collective auto obsession, since themediaВ’s finances are so tied in with the auto industry. В  The government, too, is saturated withlobbyists representing the interests of the auto, oil, tire, and roadconstruction industries, thus prohibiting major promulgation of alternativetransportation funding. В  Subtleapparitions also occur in other ways, e.g. the glorification of winning a В”newcarВ” as the top prize in a T.V. game show or at the New York Marathon, autocompany sponsorship of bicycle races, etc. В В В В В В В В В В В  Whilethe media continue to glorify accidents involving airplanes, trains, subways orbuses, over 40,000 people a year - a Vietnam War total -die in car accidents.(1) В  According to the U.S. NationalSafety Council, the death rate per mile travelled in a car is 18 times greaterthan in a train and 97 times greater than in a bus. (2) В  This does not include pedestrians; В  in New York City alone, 283 pedestrians werekilled and 15,600 were injured by motorists in 1993. (3) В  Within the developing worldВ’s chaotic mix ofmotorized and non-motorized vehicles, the driver and pedestrian fatality rateis close to 20 times greater than in the United States. (4) В  Car use also adversely affects human healthby promoting a more sedentary lifestyle than, say, someone who gets around bybicycle. В  The ethos of the car oriented suburbs,says the social critic Lewis Mumford, В”creates an encapsulated life, spent moreand more either in a motor car or within the cabin of darkness before thetelevision set.В” В  Urban commuters whodrive to and from work increase their levels of stress and hypertension, asthey long to escape traffic and arrive at work or at home. В  Being stuck in traffic will subsequentlyaffect workerВ’s morale and productivity, and, along with delayed delivery ofgoods, costs the American economy $100 billion a year, according to the GeneralAccounting Office. (5) THE SUBSIDIZING OF THE AMERICAN MOTORIST В В В В В В В В В В В  Thepromotion of car culture is clearly evident in the massive subsidies bestowedupon motorists to enable them to drive almost anywhere as cheaply andefficiently as possible. В  The true costsof driving an automobile are obfuscated, for their disclosure would certainlyreduce auto use and make alternative means more attractive. В  This would not be compatible with theinterests of the oil, car, road construction, or development industries, all ofwhom contribute heavily to politicians on the local and national levels. В В В В В В В В В В В  Amplecheap and free parking is a significant way in which motorists aresubsidized. В  Real estate values in urbanareas are costly, yet motorist are allowed to use up to 100 square feet ofpublic space for the storage of their vehicles. В  What reserves the side of the street to be used for the solepurpose of parking cars? В  Could one usethe space for storage instead? В  To put atrampoline, maybe? В  Could one open up afuton in a parking space and sleep overnight? В  What privileges car owners to eat up such valuable urban space, whenothers pay hundreds of dollars for apartments hardly bigger than a parkingspace? В В В В В В В В В В В  Theallotment of public space is just one of the many ways in which motorists areheavily subsidized in our country. В  Charlie Komanoff, an energy consultant in New York, calculates a totalsubsidy of $700 billion per year, averaging out to about $5.50 per gallon,through the federal and state government В  levels. В  He estimates that thisis roughly equivalent to what the individual motorist pays for upkeep, fuel,insurance, taxes, etc. В  Therefore, hereasons, driving in the U.S. is done at half price. В  The other half is provided for by the taxpayer. В  This puts those who do not drive: theelderly, poor people, or those who choose not to, at a severe financialdisadvantage. В  В В В В В В В В В В В  Accordingto the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, taxes from gas, new car purchases,and registration, cover only 2/3 of the costs of building and maintaininghighways and roads. (6) В  The remainingcosts arrive via the general tax fund. В  To cover the myriad of costs associated with driving, gas would have tobe between $3-$4 per gallon. (7) В  Thisis closer to the rate found in European countries, where gas tax is 5x В  greater than in the U.S. В  (Additionally, taxes on new car purchasesoverseas are close to 50% of the cost, where here, the rate is 5-10% of thetotal cost of the new car.) В  Consideringthe uproar over President ClintonВ’s 1993 request for a 10 cent increase in gastaxes, it is easy to see why hidden subsidies need to replace a system ofdirect taxation. В В В В В В В В В В В  Theprimary cost of a car dependant transportation system is the construction andmaintenance of highways, roads, and bridges, to the tune of $200 million a day.(8) В  However, there are many other waysin which motorists are getting a В”free rideВ”. В  A significant portion of our security forces are utilized in automobilerelated issues: accidents, thefts, traffic control, and parkingenforcement. В  These police officerscould be much better utilized going after true criminals, rather than wavingrush-hour traffic along, or investigating a minor traffic accident. В  Many of these accidents expound yet anotherburden on the taxpayer by disabling expensive pieces of publicinfrastructure. В  Destroyed firehydrants, light poles, mailboxes, street signs, guardrails, planters, etc.become financial burdens that would be mitigated in a society less reliant onautomobiles for transportation. В  Besidesmunicipal police, State Police units are an enormous public expense, andapprehending highway speeders seems to be their raison dВ’etre . В В В В В В В В В В В  В  Additionally, a large portion of health carecosts are related to car accidents. В  Oiland car companies get large public subsidies, ranging from tax breaks to oilexploration permits on public lands. В  Employers are allowed to deduct from their taxes the expense ofproviding parking for their workers, and receive tax benefits for providingcompany cars. В  They are more strictlylimited when it comes to tax incentives for mass transit or bicycle use.(9) В  The environmental damage due to caruse: dirty air, dirty water, deforestation, etc., is impossible to calculate,but certainly not insignificant. В В В В В В В В В В В  Perhapsthe most expensive endowment of all, lies within the tangled fabric of ourforeign policy. В  Every year, we spendbillions of dollars to protect our oil tankers travelling through the PersianGulf, as well troops for foreign countries such as Saudi Arabia. В В  We even went to war to preserve our В”rightВ”to drive wherever, and whenever, we saw fit. В  This prompted Senator Bob Dole to say: В”We are there for 3 letters:O-I-L. В  That is why we are in theGulf. В  We are not there to savedemocracy. В  Saudi Arabia is not a democracy,and neither is Kuwait.В” В  Meanwhile, ifwe had continued conserving oil after 1985 at the same rate as before, we wouldhave eliminated the need for any oil from the gulf. (10) В  The industrialized worldВ’s thirst for oilhas allowed it to become pawns in international politics by their intensereliance on petroleum. В  This dependenceplays right into the hands of dictators like Saddam Hussein, who know exactlyhow to provoke our enmity. THE GREAT SUBURBAN BUILD OUT В В В В В В В В В В В  Governmentand corporate encouragement of car use, and suburban sprawl as a supportstructure for our fallacious economic В”growthВ” is nothing new. В  It began in earnest in 1936 with thecreation of the National City Lines Company, a corporate front grouprepresenting General Motors, Standard Oil, Firestone Tire, and MackTrucks. В  For the next 15 years, thispowerful company bought out 45 street car and trolley systems throughout thecountry. В  By the 1950В’s, all 45 transitsystems were completely dismantled, opening the way for private car use andincreased bus service, a demand that GM was all too happy to supply. В  This was the sad fate of publictransportation in Los Angeles, a system nearly as extensive as New YorkВ’s. В  Eventually, National City Lines was foundguilty of criminal antitrust violations, but the verdict was moot, for thegreat suburban build out was in full throttle. В В В В В В В В В В В  Meanwhile,in the 1930В’s, RooseveltВ’s Federal Housing Authority (FHA) was created to putthe post-depression construction industry back on its feet, and to improve thehousing stock for Americans. В  The FHAsubsidized banks through the federal treasury, and therefore allowed forreduced downpayments, and extended mortgages. В  Unfortunately, the FHA did not guarantee new loans for those who wantedto build or renovate in the inner cities. В  Maybe this should come as no surprise considering that one itscommissioners happened to be on the Board of Directors of the Standard OilCompany. В  After WWII, the governmentallowed the millions of returning G.I.В’s to own homes without any necessarydownpayment, and mortgage interests were made tax deductible. В  Thus ownership was made less expensive thanrenting, and with the planned system of new highways, white veterans flocked tothe burgeoning suburbs. В  В В В В В В В В В В В  Asfarmland and forests were being paved over with housing developments in the1950В’s, the county and state road systems were becoming overburdened. В  Our economy demanded more growth, and theFederal Government began the largest public works project in our history, theInterstate Highway System. В  PresidentEisenhower began funding the highways after a hearty recommendation by his selfappointed commission, chaired by Lucius D. Clay, on the Board of Directors ofGeneral Motors. В  41,000 miles of newexpressways spread over the country like a complex of veins and arteries.(11) В  Apologists for the vast newhighway system insisted that they would quicken urban evacuation in the case ofa Soviet nuclear attack, and, that they would provide enormous expanses ofpavement and concrete to act as firebreaks, allowing sectors to remainunscathed. В В В В В В В В В В В  Manycompanies had enormous profits to make through suburban expansion. В  The obvious beneficiaries were the oil andcar companies, but many others which produced appliances, lawn mowers, lawncare products, etc. stood to cash in also. В  A major player was General Electric, who realized that every new homewas certain to need a new washer and dryer, refrigerator, stove, blender, andother convenience items. В  GE knew thattheir fortunes lay within the increased unpopularity of urban apartmentliving. В  To encourage this, theysponsored many exhibitions and architectural competitions to glorify the modernsuburban house. В  Famous architectsnormally won the competitions, bringing with them the legitimacy, and presscoverage, of the single family suburban home. В В В В В В В В В В В  Whilelarge sums of money funded the creation of highways and airports, railimprovements were all but forgotten. В  Sustainable, non-polluting alternatives have never been В  encouraged by our government except inemergency situations such as oil embargoes. В  The sprawling suburbs В  came to acrawl after the 1973 oil embargo, and subsequently President Carter soughtalternative energy sources and decreased automobile reliance. В  After the election of Ronald Reagan, the oilcartel weakened, Iran and Iraq were soon to be engaged in a long and brutalwar, and the oil market was flooded. В  With cheap gas, bank deregulation, and ReaganВ’s tax policies, suburbandevelopment and car-use went back into high gear throughout the 1980В’s. В  During this time period, Federal funding forhighways nearly doubled while the funding for mass transit was actually reducedby 10%. (12) В  In 1994, $20.3 billion wasassigned to roads and highways while only $1 billion was allocated for railimprovements. (13) В В В В В В В В В В В  В В В  A CRITIQUE OF SUBURBAN CULTURE В В В В В В В В В В В  Itwas the promise of open space which initially lead many people to the suburbanfrontier. В  Paradoxically, suburbs havebeen allowed to sprawl unchecked for so long that very little of this openspace or nature exists anymore. В  Peopleare now either moving back into the city, or moving further and further intoexurbia. В  The pace of this exodus hasbeen exascerbated by advances in computers and the burgeoning В”informationsuperhighwayВ”. В  Advances in hightechnology have rendered the proximity to the city as insignificant for some,and has allowed them to create home offices on the fringes of thewilderness. В  These В”pioneersВ” areincreasing the extirpation of forests and farmland by building structures androads into areas where none belong. В В В В В В В В В В В  Wherehalf a century ago, most people lived in a city or a rural location, thepost-war blossoming of our car culture has allowed the typical American to nowlive in a suburban housing development. В В  Ostensibly designed to preserve open space, these communities lack public В  open space and, due to dysfunctional zoningregulations, are spread so thinly that public transportation becomesellusive. В В  Therefore, a car trip is therequired method of transportation for every task; it is no wonder that theaverage American motorist drives 10,000 miles a year. (14) В В В В В В В В В В В  Theneed to drive everywhere increases social fragmentation and is most detrimentalto those who cannot drive: the elderly, the sick, children, and the poor, allof whom become completely dependant on the car driver for mobility. В  Ironically, many families initially relocateto suburbs for the В”goodВ” of their children, yet their children are stuck invirtual isolation and dependence, for their communities are designed not forthem, but instead for cars. В  Thus, theyspend a great deal of their time in front of the television for this becomesthe prime atraction in many suburbs whose landscape is defined by housingdevelopments, parking lots, fast food joints, and expressway off-ramps. В  The suburban landscape that most politicianswould proudly call В”growthВ”, has greatly contributed to the deterioration ofcommunity and culture, for community has been substituted with shopping malls,and culture has been replaced by television. В В В В В В В В В В В  Muchof the reason why suburbs look the way they do is because of zoning laws. В  Drafted by planning boards often representingdevelopment and business interests, many of the codes are provided for theconvenience of automobiles as if they were the dominant life form on theplanet. В  The main premise behind ourcurrent zoning codes is the complete and distanced seperation of homes andjobs, as if we still inhabited cities of smokestacked factories and revoltingslaughterhouses. В  With segregationrather than mixed-use, the ability to perform daily errands or go to workbecomes impossible by walking or biking, and with poor mass transit, a motorvehicle becomes a necessity. В  Additionally, it creates the dysfunctional hierarchy of the commercialstrip, the destination for so many who simply need a soda or a newspaper. В  Corner stores are not allowed in mostsuburban residential neighborhoods, nor are apartments allowed above shops andrestaurants, denying mixed use buildings, and keeping density at a minimum. В В В В В В В В В В В  Zoninglaws regarding street design contribute to the lack of community in mostsuburbs. В  These laws deny enclosure, sonecessary in making quality street spaces. В  The comforting feeling of enclosure is what makes 19th centurybrownstone-lined streets so charming. В  Compare a street in old-world Brooklyn or Boston to one that has a widepaved surface, no sidewalk, facades comprised of garages, and houses setbackfrom the street and spaced at large intervals. В В  Requirements for wide streets make speeds in excess of 35 m.p.h.possible, and, street trees and sharp curves are heartily discouraged for fearof prompting traffic accidents. В  Towering alien-like street lamps block out the stars and exist so thatlate night motorist can negociate the street at higher speeds. В  All told, suburban zoning laws mandate anenvironment designed for automobile driving, and with zero regard for the publicrealm. (15) В В В В В В В В В В В  Onthe commercial boulevards, zoning requires that buildings be set back certaindistances and provide vast parking lots. В  The amalgamation of these structures resembles a gridded archipelagowithin a vast sea of pavement. В  Architecturally, these areas are as cheaply constructed as they areunsightly, and many design elements are at a scale not commiserate topedestrians. В  The attempt to luremotorists comes to its utter perversion as gas stations and restaurants floattheir signs hundreds of feet in the air, begging for the attention of thespeeding motorist. В  The suburban striphas also created its own building and spacial typologies: the drive-inrestaurant, enormous billboards, car washes, gas stations, drive-in movietheaters, and of course, the ubiqutous used car lot. CAR CULTUREВ’S INVASION OF THE METROPOLIS В В В В В В В В В В В  TheautomobileВ’s infusion into our cities has had a major impact on urbanarchitecture likewise. В  Car culture hascreated the В”architecture of subtractionВ”, as pieces and parts of towns andcities have been eviscerated to make room for automobiles. В  This has excised portions of urban fabric,taking away street definition, so important in civic space making. В  Buildings and entire blocks have beenremoved to make parking lots. В  Gasstations become instant eyesores, and usurp large areas of space potentiallyused for public plazas, parks, or buildings. В  Both take away from the pedestrian experience of movement through acity, and abate the visual and cultural stimulation. В  Instead of strolling along a well defined street with interestingshop display windows and greenery, a bleak landscape of cars is considered. В В В В В В В В В В В  Neverbefore has an invention that so many people consider a necessity taken up somuch space. В  In older cities such as Bostonor New York, close to 1/2 of the ground space is reserved for the sole purposeof moving and storing cars, and in newer cities such as Los Angeles or Pheonix,it is closer to 2/3. (16) В  Theseinequities become quite obvious by simply walking the streets of Manhattan, forexample. В  The distrubution of pedestrianspace compared to automobile space is heavily weighed towards the motorist,even in midtown Manhattan, where millions work, or Greenwich Village where thousandssocialize. В  Hundreds of people can bejammed onto narrow sidewalks, while cars stream by on four and five laneavenues. В  In the battle for urban turf,the clear winner is the automobile. В В В В В В В В В В В  Fewcivic interventions compare to the destruction wrought by urban expressways,which functionally, have done nothing that commuter rail lines couldnВ’tdo. В  From the beginning, expresswayswere ostensibly built to bring commuters into the city more easily, but, whatthey have really done is to drain the city of its middle class by providing avery compelling reason to leave. В  Ashighways plowed through cities in the 1950В’s and 1960В’s, dense urbanneighborhoods of different ethnicities were removed and highrise housingprojects took their place. В  Thegovernment, sensing the surge in black migration north, built these projects tohouse them and simultaneously provided urban highways to allow the white middleclass to escape, encouraging segregation. В  Highways were not so much built to ameliorate В  traffic congestion, instead they created В  traffic congestion by decentralizing urbanareas. В В В В В В В В В В В  Urbanexpressways fracture neighborhoods and are accompanied by a host of subsequenturban predicaments. В  Besides theintroduction of air and noise pollution, the highways are like stakes driventhrough the hearts of intact neighborhoods. В  Geographically, they are often constructed along natural boundaries andedges resulting in the seperation of the urban realm from rivers, lakes, bays,and oceans. В  Not only does this deny theheritage of a city, whos economy may have been based on a local body of water,but it also prohibits public access to natural open spaces. В  Highways built above grade are like massivefortress walls of noise and smog, and built below grade they resemble moats,often with infrequent overpasses to further divide the community. From aneconomic point of view, they are quite detrimental, for the dense urban fabriccleared for the widened road subtracts formerly taxable land. В  The maligning effects of the highway reverberatefrom block to block, and quickly property values plummet, and a once middleclass neighborhood turns to squalor as residents flee to the suburbs on thevery highway that destroyed their neighborhoods. В  The void is soon filled with the economically disadvantagedimmigrants, and the municipality, loathing the loss of property taxes, allowsthe area to crumble. В  This scenario hasplayed a major role in the disintegration of many of AmericaВ’s cities from LosAngeles, to Detroit, to the South Bronx. В В В В В В В В В В В  Culturally,the ubiquity of cars has had the largest impact on our street culture, thecommon bond of communities. В  The В”publicspaceВ” of the urban and suburban street has, for the most part, beencompromised for the singular purpose of moving and storing automobiles. В  This relinquishes public space to thefavored car owners of our society. В  Street space incubates social interactions, and these become much moredifficult when streets are filled with noisy, polluting, and speeding motorvehicles. В  According to the latearchitectural historian Spiro Kostoff, В”the street stands as the burial placeof a chance to learn from one another, the burial place of unrehearsedexcitement, of the cumulative knowledge of human ways. В  We lose this because we would rather keep toourselves, avoid social tension by escaping it, schedule encounters withfriends, and happily travel alone in climate controlled and music injectedglossy metal boxes.В” (17) В В В В В В В В В В В  Insome large cities, streets have become so chaotic and polluted that separateplanes of pedestrian movement have developed. В  Rather than confronting the real epidemic, cities and private sourceshave built extensive systems of bridges and underground concourses, keeping thepublic off of the ground plane, where social intercourse traditionallyoccurred. В  These ersatz public spacesfail to bring together urban society in all of its diversity. В  The quasi-public nature of the bridges andconcourses are undemocratic, in that they allow the often private controllingbody to eliminate certain undesirable elements, such as the homeless ordemonstrations. В В В В В В В В В В В  Sadly,many have forgotten or may never know the true vitality of an authentic streetculture. В  DisneylandВ’s Main Street orthe local mall will never be appropriate substitutes. В  Instead, much of the built landscape is a pathetic malaise ofsqualor and dysfunctional planning, yet most of us feel that it was an organicprocess that could not be ameliorated. В В В В В В В В В В В  Carcultures affect on crime in this country cannot be ignored. В  Auto usage results directly in many violentcrimes such as car jackings В  and drive-by shootings, В  and is often anintegral part of much gang activity and violence. В  Interestingly, it is in large cities that rely most heavily onautomobile transportation where major gang problems are most prevalent. В  Compare gang activity in Los Angeles to NewYorkВ‘s, for example. В  Many criminalsrely on a getaway car , for the multitude of roads and expresswaysprovide a convenient means of escape. В  The ubiquity of roads make it easy to buy drugs, pick up a prostitute,rob a store, or blow up an office building. В  These criminal acts become more difficult in a society whosetransportation needs are met with mass transit and bicycles. В В В В В В В В В В В  Theissue of access to terrorism has finally met the attention of our federalgovernment. В  After months ofdeliberation President Clinton ordered the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue, justweeks after the Oklahoma City bombing. В  Although the three block stretch of road has been reclaimed as publicspace, filled with hundreds of tourists and roller skaters, the need toВ”apologizeВ” was still pervasive. В  Quotedin The New York Times , the President said that the street closing wasВ”seen as a responsible security step necessary to preserve our freedom, notpart of a long term restriction of our freedom.В” В  To equate automobile access of a section of street with freedomis absolutely ludicrious, but, in a car dominant society, many motorists feelthat they have the В”rightВ” to drive anywhere, whether that be deep into aNational Park, or directly in front of the White House. В  Maybe the PresidentВ’s attitude comes as nosurprise to those who remember his valiant appeals to the American psyche bydeclaring, after the 1993 Los Angeles earthquake, that, В”freeway reconstructionwill be the most urgent need.В” В В В В В В В В В В В  Somecities are finally coming to terms with the cars-and-crime reality, and havebegun programs to limit automobiles in neighborhoods vulnerable tolawbreaking. В  In Dayton, Ohio, the mixedincome racially diverse neighborhood of 5 Oaks recently gated its throughstreets, allowing access only to residentsВ’ automobiles, and foot and bicycletraffic. В  According to The New YorkTimes , overall crime went down by 25% after the change and violent crimewas reduced by 50%. В  Additionally,neighborhoods in Coconut Grove, Florida, Austin, Texas, Bridgeport,Connecticut, and Los Angeles, have all had success with physical prohibition ofthru-traffic. В  These neighborhoods haveexperience rebirth as drug dealing and prostitution have been severely limited,although critics say that the deviant behavior has simply moved elsewhere. В  Nonetheless, these examples show thepotential of retaking public space away from the influx of automobiles andreturning it to the community. В В В В В В В В В В В  Basedupon car cultureВ’s incorrigible impact on North America, one shudders to thinkof this becoming an international precedent. В  Sadly, it is already happening. В  Since the collapse of the Soviet monolith and the opening of theFar-Eastern markets, multi-national auto makers and oil companies have beendrooling over their prospects. В  According to The New York Times , В  Hungary and Poland already have 50% more cars than before the end of thecold-war, and government support for mass transit has waned. В  The Chinese government, while vigorouslypushing to modernize their country, В  have begun enormous road building projects, hoping to encourage tens ofmillions to buy cars. В  Like post-warAmerica, China seems to be blinded by the fallacious aura surrounding theautomobile, and have failed to consider the consequences. В  Recently, The Beijing Review В  stated in the purest of Orwelliandoublespeak, that, В”vigorous development of private cars will effectively helpease the strain on urban trafficВ…as the replacement of bicycles with cars willenable Chineese cities to realize traffic modernization.В” В  Perhaps Chinese officials should try drivingan L.A. freeway at rushhour, or biking up 6th Avenue in Manhattan before theymake such hasty decisions for their country. THE DESTRUCTION OF FARMLAND, FORESTS, ANDWILDLIFE В В В В В В В В В В В  Theconstantly expanding suburban malaise is inexoribly connected with cheap gas,the lack of mass transit, and an obdurate government nearly bought and paid forby lobbyists from the development, oil, automobile, and paving industries. В  The natural desire to live В”out in thecountryВ” brings meddlesome human beings closer and closer to our dwindlingwildlands. В  In the last forty years, wehave destroyed more land than in the 300 years before, this is due not so muchto population growth, but to the natural properties of car culture. В  The environmental damage has beenunprecedented: the dwindling quality of the air and water, the loss of naturalresources, and the destruction of farmland, forests, and wildlife. Theomeba-like suburbs, left unchecked, will sprawl further into the deserts of theSouthwest, the forests of Pacific Northwest, the mountains of Colorado, thefarmlands of the midwest, and the last few remaining wild places in theNortheast. В В В В В В В В В В В  Fromthe perspective of the use of natural resources, the automobile orientedsuburbs are perniciously inefficient. Consider the environment impact of acar-oriented suburban style community of 500 households, and an urban communityfor the same 500 households. The land use requirements for the former areenormous as each house occupies a 1/4 or 1/2 acre lot and is connected by wideroads. The 500 individual homes require vast amounts of materials to build andmust be connected by a myriad of power, water, and sewer lines, В  putting a strain on our dwindling naturalresources. Although urban communities are not perfect, they have a much lowerecological impact considering their compact land use, efficiency of materialsand infrastructure, and maintained distance from wilderness and wildlife. В  Additionally, each house in the suburban communitybecomes but an island within the paradigmatic lush green lawn. В  Forget the fact that grass is not native tomany areas of our country, every homeowner demands one, whether living in lushNew England, or the Arizona desert. В  American lawns total 20 million acres, quadruple the size of Washingtonstate, and require enormous amounts of water and chemicals to keep green. В  Lawns and their required mowers have becometotems of our fetishism with grass, resulting in polluted water tables, noisyneighborhoods, and vast amounts of ecologically useless land. В В В В В В В В В В В  Thecommon piece of infrastructure that is necessary for all suburban and exurbandevelopments is the paved road. В  Everysquare foot of pavement represents an ecological dead zone, a completelysterilized environment that allows the runoff of oil, antifreeze, and brakefluids into the water table. When a road is built in a remote area close towilderness, it not only brings polluting and dangerous cars, but also bringswith it the constant pressure of continued development. The close proximity tonature brings in items not native to a bioregion such as noise, garbage, dogs,vehicles, and guns. Roads also allow the hordes of hunters, poachers, andtrappers to drive into remote areas to exterminate wildlife. В В В В В В В В В В В  Therecent rise in popularity of campers and four wheel drive vehicles haveaccelerated the complete commodification of the natural world. Now we can allhave a packaged environment, seen from the safety of mobile fortresses as ifthe planet were one big theme park. Television advertisements convince viewersthat the appropriate 4-wheel drive vehicle will allow them to cross rivers,blaze through forests, and drive to remote mountain vista points. Car culturehas clearly brought too many people to places that they do not necessarilybelong. В В В В В В В В В В  В В В В В В В В В В В  Agreat tragedy is the quantity of wild animals that are struck and killed everyyear by speeding automobiles. More than half a billion animals, including 1/4of a million people, are killed every year on the planetВ’s roads and highways.(18) В  This is 10 times more creatureskilled by cars than by the American pork industry, for comparison. (19) В  The average AmericanВ’s car kills 3 to 4 vertebrateanimals per year and have contributed to the endangerment of some species, mostnotably the Florida panther, 65% of whose documented deaths have been at thehands of motorists travelling through the Ocala National Forest. InPennsylvania alone in 1985, 26,180 deer and 90 bears were slaughtered byautomobiles. (20) В  In the MikumiNational Park in Tanzania, more animals, including baboons, wildebeest, zebras,antelopes, jackals, and even elephants, have been killed by cars than bypoachers since the1991 road improvements increased the maximum speed from 20m.p.h. to 60 m.p.h. (21) В В В В В В В В В В В  Somespecies are attracted to roads, while others are averted, both of which havedisastrous implications for the animals forced to deal with the intrusion. В  Animals averted to roads run the risk ofgenetic deterioration due to inbreeding. This is created by the fragmentationof their populations, hemmed in by roads on all sides. This also affects thehealthy migration of animals, and forces them to stay in unnatural climates.The noises due to road construction and the resulting traffic can alter an animalВ’spattern of activity, and raises their stress levels. This is especially true ofbirds who rely heavily on auditory signals. В В В В В В В В В В В  Exacerbatingthe quantity of roadkill is the unfortunate fact that many animals areattracted to the typography of a road. The dense vegetation at road sideattracts grazing deer and a multitude of rodents. The proliferation of rodents,along with previously killed animals attracts scavengers such as coyote andracoon, who in turn are often struck by cars. В  Other large mammals also come to the roadway to innocently use it as atravel corridor. The proximity of the large mammals attracts В  curious and naive onlookers who frequentlyharass the animals or try to feed them human food. Wild animals also come tothe road to eat de-icing salts in the winter season, increasing the potentialof a collision, but also poisoning the animal due to the sodium and calciumchlorides present in the salt. (20) В В В В В В В В В В В  Anotherway in which automobile ownership and use is detrimental to the environment isthe vast quantities of natural resources required to sustain a transportationmode. Besides the seemingly infinite amalgam of wood, gravel, asphalt, andsteel used to build and maintain the EarthВ’s roads and highways, the worldВ’s400 million cars requires excessive amounts of resources and energy to create.In a culture less reliant on automobiles, the inner city streetВ‘s ubiquitousabandoned car, the monumentalized pile of worn tires, or the junkyard cache offlattened cars would be greatly lessened. В В В В В В В В В В В  Althoughmost cars can last much longer, many are passed on after only a few years. Thiskeeps car companies profits rolling in. В  Complicit designers are all too happy to continually churn out the В  latest models with improved aerodynamics,racier colors, and the newest gizmos of convenience. In 1955, Harvey Earl, thehead of the GM styling division said, В”Our biggest job is to hastenobsolescence. In 1934, the average car ownership span was five years; now itis В  two years. When it is one year, wewill have a perfect score.В” В В В В В В В В В В В  Theenvironmental problem most apparent to the public is air pollution. Withinurban areas, cars are the single largest source of air pollution, and create13% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions, 28% of Chlorofluorocarbons, andbetween 30-40% of nitrogen oxides, the primary chemical responsible for acidrain, according to the Marland Energy Magazine in 1983. The E.P.A. reports thatautomobile air conditioners are the single largest source of ozone depletingchemical. В  Despite the fact that thesedays cars produce 1/2 as much carbon monoxide as they did twenty yearsago, this has only had beneficial results within the purlieus of urban smogquantity. At the same time, the amount of carbon dioxide released fromcars is the same and will always be the same, for it is the inevitablebyproduct of fossil fuel consumption. The invisible and odorless CO2 cannot bereduced no matter the filter or cat. converter on the newest, most aerodynamiccar, and it is this insidious CO2 gas which is contributing greatly to thegreenhouse effect. (22) В  Despite thefact that presently cars produce 1/2 as much carbon monoxide as they didtwenty years ago, this has only had beneficial results within the confines ofurban smog quantity. At the same time, the amount of carbon dioxide released from cars is the same and will always be the same, for it is theinevitable byproduct of fossil fuel consumption. The invisible and odorless CO2cannot be reduced no matter the filter or cat. converter on the newest, mostaerodynamic car, and it is this insidious CO2 gas which is contributing greatlyto the greenhouse effect. (22) В  В В В В В В В В В В В  Airpollution also accelerates the deterioration of a city's infrastructure andbuildings, especially those of historic value. В  Buildings in many cities have been severely discolored due to pollutedair, and those lying on busy streets and thoroughfares need facade renovationmuch more frequently than those on calmer streets. В  Some structures even experience structural damage due to heavy,rumbling trucks. В  CleopatraВ’s Needle, anEgyptian obelisk in New YorkВ’s Central Park, a weekday speedway, hasdegenerated more in the 35 years since its been in Manhattan, than in theprevious 3500 years in the harsh desert climate of Egypt. В В В В В В В В В В В  Itis the profligate use of oil, in many ways, that may contain the mostecological destructive component of all: the ubiquitous oil spill. В  Ubiquitous in a sense that the Exxon Valdezdisaster was not an anomaly; spills of that magnitude occur quite often, andhave disastrous implications on the ecology of the worldВ‘s oceans. В  Greenpeace estimates that one billiongallons of oil В  are directly spilledinto the oceans every year. В  Valdez wasonly the 14th largest spill in history, but, because most others occurred offshore and did not directly reach a populated land mass, their was a dearth ofmedia coverage. В  Accidental spills onlyrepresent 17% of the total oil which enters the marine environment. В  The rest, enters the oceans via the routineflushing of carrier tanks, and the daily byproducts of the petroleum industry.Another 50 million gallons of gallons of petroleum seeps into the worldВ’s freshwater supply through the daily run-off from roads and do-it-yourself mechanics.(23) В  Although the estimation of thetotal death of sea creatures and birds due to oil spillage isincalculable, В  the toll from the AlaskaValdez incident, according to Greenpeace, led to the deaths of 5000 otters, 200harbor seals, and perhaps 1/2 a million birds. В В В В В В В В В В В  Thedemand for petroleum constantly pressures the oil industry to search for oil inmore and more remote places. The oil companiesВ‘ thirst for profit leaves themwith no concern for the consequences of their actions. They would drill in theGrand Canyon or sink a derelict oil platform in a whale sanctuary if theythought they could get away with it. В  Their powerful lobbyists are constantly persuading the U.S. and othergovernments to open up fragile wilderness and marine habitats for oilexploration, whether it be in a tropical rainforest, a spectacular mountainrange, or the Arctic tundra. When habitats are opened up for exploration, greatdamage is done even if oil is not found in sufficient quantities to warrantrefining. Seismic studies destroy habitat and terrify wildlife, and the myriadof abandoned roads are often subsequently used by logging companies to get toareas that were initially off limits to them. The predicament can only getworse, for as Asia, especially China, developes its system of roads and opensits markets, the numbers of cars are expected to double globally by 2010. В В В  В В В В В В В В В В В  Theultimate fallacy of an economy and lifestyle dependent upon cheap and plentifuloil is that it is not sustainable. В  According to the Hubbert Curve on oil production, an industryforecasting standard, the world is expected to run out of its oil by 2040, atthe present rate of use. В  Petroleumdepletion could be mitigated if motorists would pay for the true costs ofdriving, thus making alternatives, such as trains and bicycles, moreattractive. В  Higher taxes must be leviedupon gas, registration, and new car purchases, and tolls need to be increased,especially for solitary commuters. В  Thiswould not only offset the many subsidized costs of auto transit, but would alsocreate capital for rail improvements. В  The discouragement of automobile use must begin today, or we run therisk of being unprepared when the pumps run dry and В”carmaggedonВ” day is uponus. CONCLUSION В В В В В В В В В В В  Manyof humanityВ’s most pressing problems such as deforestation, the loss ofbiodiversity, the dwindling of native cultures, global warming, the loss ofcommunties, and water pollution, can be traced to the overuse of automobiles,and unchecked suburban development. В В  Cars are here to stay and they certainly have their uses, but, too manypeople have deemed these uses to mean every single trip, whether one mile orone hundred miles. В  We have beenbrainwashed into demanding a table in the non-smoking section of a restaurantand then, after the meal, either driving home, or walking along noisy, chaotic,and polluted streets. В  The dailybombardment of automobile images and our governmentВ’s obstinate attitudetowards alternatives has allowed us to accept the auto-dominated landscape thatsurrounds us all. В  Until this type ofbehavior is curbed, our decadent lifestyle will continue to decimatecommunities and cities, and precipitate the ongoing destruction of the naturalworld.
