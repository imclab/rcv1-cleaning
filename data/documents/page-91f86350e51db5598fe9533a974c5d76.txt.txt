Click here to start your search. If you're planning to be in Southern California anytime soon, you'll want to be sure to check out one or two of these car-related happenings. Even if you're not planning to be there, you might want to make plans just to see some of them. Feb. 24: A great way to meet drag-racing heroes and support a good cause will be drag racer Doug Herbert's Southern California Benefit Dinner at the Wally Parks NHRA Motorsports Museum in Pomona. Herbert founded the teen-driver training organization B.R.A.K.E.S. after his two sons were killed in a car crash. The school has since trained more than 3,000 teen drivers in safe behind-the-wheel techniques. At the dinner, expect to see Shirley Muldowney, Del Worsham, Jack Beckman, Ron Capps and maybe even John Force and others. Visit www.putonthebrakes.org . Feb. 29-March 3: Deuce Week is actually four days of tours and seminars that culminate with one of the best gatherings of 1932 Fords you'll see all year on the open third deck of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. The first two days' tours are sold out, but there's still room available on the Nethercutt Museum and Galpin Auto Sports tours and for the Hot Rod Round Table, the rock concert and the big Deuce Day Car Show. There will even be nine new '32 pedal cars made by local hot-rod shops. Visit www.deuceweek.org . April 19-21: The Ford-Cobra-Shelby Reunion promises to be a three-day Cobra lovefest. It will include racing on the genuine, original Pomona track used by the greatest sports-car racers of the 1950s, a new exhibit at the NHRA museum honoring the Cobra's 50th anniversary and even a banquet honoring the old snakemeister himself, Carroll Shelby. There also will be two rare and ferocious King Cobra sports cars, two of only eight ever built. Both are winners of the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix at Riverside, one driven by Dave MacDonald and the other by Parnelli Jones. Visit museum.nhra.com . May 6: You'd have to pay big bucks to go to Concorso Italiano or someplace to see more beautiful Ferraris than you'll see for free lined up on Colorado Boulevard in Old Town Pasadena for the Ferrari Club of America's Concorso Ferrari. More than 150 examples of the Prancing Horse from all eras will line up, from 355s you might have seen before to graceful and speedy vintage beasts from the 1950s and '60s. Last year, the best in show honor went to David Sydorick's 1956 250GT Zagato Berlinetta, and where else are you going to see one of those? Visit www.fca-sw.org .
