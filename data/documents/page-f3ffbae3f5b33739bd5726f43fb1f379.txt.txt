It was built for auto racing, specifically to take on Ferrari in the GT class. Just six Daytona original coupes were built between 1964 and 1965. Shelby was reassigned to the Ford GT40 project after that to go compete at the 24 hours of Le Mans, again to beat Ferrari. With this car Shelby became the first American constructor to win a title on the international scene at the FIA World Sportscar Championship in 1965. Despite the fact that the design never entered production, those six cars, hand-built upon 289 AC chassis, became symbolic of the end of an era. The Shelby Daytona Coupe is one of the most unique and stunning shapes in automotive history. Even today, more than 45 years later, the muscular lines and aggressive stance has no equal. While the dramatic design makes people stop and stare, only the hard-core car guys know its full history. You wonâ&euro;&trade;t see three of them lined up at your local cruise-in. 1965 Shelby American Cobra Daytona Coupe (Factory Five, Shelby American, Ford Racing) Titled as: 1965 Shelby American - Engine: Ford Racing 392 cubic inch Windsor crate motor 475HP - Transmission: Heavy duty Tremec 5 speed from Ford Racing - Wheels: Ford GT Magnesium 18" front & 19"back - Tires: P235/45ZR Goodyear Eagle F-1 rated at 175 MPH - Brakes and Rotors: Cobra from Ford Racing - Cooling: Griffin Race Radiator - Rear Suspension: Completely Independent "Ford Super Coupe" - Front suspension: All tubular control arms, upgraded spindles & springs - Battery: Odyssey - Interior: Heat Shielded/Sound Proofed with Dynamat Carpet - Seats: Kirkey Racing Seats with Simpson Harness - Gauges: Speed, Tach, Fuel, Oil pressure, Oil temp., Voltage, Push to Start and Battery Cut-Off switch The car starts, runs, sounds, and drives great and is for the discriminating buyer who enjoys high performance eye turning vehicles.
