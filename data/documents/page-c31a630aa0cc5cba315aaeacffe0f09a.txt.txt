Rihanna Sues FormerAccountants Posted in Celebrity , Music with tags former accountants , Rihanna , sues on July 13, 2012 by thebestmusicnow Superstar Rihanna has sued her former accountants for mismanaging the singer&#8217;s finances, including claiming they earned huge commissions from concert tours that resulted in her losing millions of dollars. In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court that surfaced on Thursday, the 24-year-old singer and her tour company, Tourihanna, is seeking an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and loss of earnings from accountancy firm Berdon LLP and former employees Michael Mitnick and Peter Gounis. The suit, first filed late in Tuesday ahead of the July 4 U.S. holiday, claims the accounting firm caused &#8220;significant financial losses&#8221; between 2005 and 2010 by charging &#8220;exorbitant&#8221; commissions from Rihanna&#8217;s 2010 &#8220;Last Girl on Earth Tour.&#8221; It also accuses Berdon of mishandling Rihanna&#8217;s foreign and domestic taxes and failing to monitor unpaid song royalties. Leave A Comment &#187; Steven Tyler Says Goodbye to AmericanIdol Posted in Celebrity , Music , Music news with tags American Idol , Goodbye , Jennifer Lopez , judge , leaves show , Steven Tyler on July 13, 2012 by thebestmusicnow American Idol judge and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler decided on Thursday to leave his job as a judge on top-rated television singing contest &#8220;American Idol.&#8221; Tyler expressed that his reason for leaving is due to needing to return to focusing on his first love, Aerosmith. Tyler&#8217;s fellow &#8220;American Idol&#8221; judge, Jennifer Lopez, also is contemplating whether to return to the program that once reigned supreme atop U.S. TV ratings but has seen its audience shrink in recent years. &#8220;I strayed from my first love, Aerosmith, and I&#8217;m back,&#8221; the band&#8217;s lead singer said in a statement. &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s time for me to let go of my mistress ‘American Idol&#8217; before she boils my rabbit,&#8221; Tyler added, in a reference to the thriller movie, &#8220;Fatal Attraction.&#8221; &#8220;I got two fists in the air, and I&#8217;m kicking the door open with my band.&#8221; Leave A Comment &#187; Justin Bieber&#8217;s &#8216;Boyfriend&#8217; Video All About &#8216;Cars,Girls&#8217; Posted in Celebrity , Music , Photo , YouTube with tags Girls' , Justin Bieber Boyfriend music video , Justin Bieber's 'Boyfriend' Video All About 'Cars on May 4, 2012 by thebestmusicnow If Justin Bieber were your boyfriend, you&#8217;d probably spend a lot of time in parkades. The pop star&#8217;s &#8220;Boyfriend&#8221; video debuted Thursday night &#8212; amassing more than 2 million views on YouTube by this morning. Shot in L.A., it&#8217;s a straightforward concept: Bieber and some Step Up 2 extras somehow drive to the top of some building, then spend the afternoon dancing and pulling donuts in their &#8220;swaggy&#8221; muscle cars. And, just like the song, the video finds Bieber making an incredibly easy pitch to the ladies: be his girlfriend. Please. A dream date with JB, however, isn’t exactly what he promises in the lyrics. There’s no fireside fondue, no trips around the world. Instead, Bieber’s special lady has to be content watching him dance, watching him lead a sing-a-long, watching him show off his hella cool wheels. And she has to share him with an extensive cast of extras &#8212; but then, that’s a feeling millions of Beliebers have long since grown used to. And for a tune that&#8217;s supposed to usher in the just-turned-18-year-old&#8217;s &#8220;mature&#8221; new era, the vibe isn&#8217;t that much different from his break-out clip, &#8220;Baby.&#8221; Bieber is still singing and dancing &#8212; dreamily &#8212; with a crew of kids. He has his driver’s license this time, though. That’s something. For more than a month, Bieber had been teasing the video&#8217;s premiere with preview clips &#8212; including 45 seconds of footage aired during an April episode of The Voice. Those clips, as we mentioned yesterday, were directed by Colin Tilley (the &#8220;Boyfriend&#8221; video was helmed by Director X), and featured Bieber in a variety of impressionistic scenes &#8212; strikingly different from sunny vibe of the final cut. Some of those scenes are used in the opening of &#8220;Boyfriend,” and as Bieber explained during an interview with MTV last night, the change-up was just him playing with his fans. &#8220;I kind of switched it up from all the teasers,&#8221; Bieber said. &#8220;I switched up the whole video on them, and really, I think it&#8217;s super cool. I wanted to do something a little bit more mature.&#8221; Just because &#8220;Boyfriend&#8221; is here doesn&#8217;t mean Bieber&#8217;s going to stop being a little tease. During his interview with MTV, he revealed he already has new tidbits to shill, all leading up to the June 19 release of upcoming album, Believe. &#8220;My next single is better,&#8221; he told MTV after “Boyfriend’s” premiere. &#8220;I think it’s &#8216;As Long As You Love Me.&#8217; It’s like mid-tempo. I just think it’s edgy. It’s something I can hear on the radio. It’s going to get stuck in people’s heads,&#8221; he said, also revealing tentative plans to release another track, written for his mom. &#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to put it out on Mother&#8217;s Day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going on the album.&#8221; Leave A Comment &#187; Beach Boys to kick off 50th anniversary tour in TucsonAZ Posted in Celebrity , Music , Photo with tags Beach Boys to kick off 50th anniversary tour in Tucson AZ on May 2, 2012 by thebestmusicnow You probably could&#8217;ve guessed it was a Beach Boys show just by the shirts the men in the audience wore: Collared, short-sleeved and oversized, with palm trees, hibiscus flowers and nautical gear printed all over them. At the back of the stage, surfboards were lined up like Grecian columns on either side of a huge video screen. It wasn&#8217;t until midway through the band&#8217;s second set that Mike Love acknowledged what half the people in the audience must&#8217;ve been thinking: &#8220;It&#8217;s, uh, been a little while since we&#8217;ve all been on tour together.&#8221; This year, the Beach Boys turn 50. Until the Grammys this past February, Brian Wilson, the band&#8217;s troubled heart, hadn&#8217;t been on stage with the rest of them since 1996. The tour kickoff last night at the Anselmo Valencia Amphitheater in Tucson was, in that sense, a milestone: not only a marker of their anniversary, but of a public reconciliation between Wilson and the band&#8217;s other surviving original members: Al Jardine, Bruce Johnson, David Marks and Wilson&#8217;s cousin, Mike Love. It&#8217;s not until a band like the Beach Boys runs through their hits back-to-back in rapid succession that you realize just how many hits they&#8217;ve had. Over the course of nearly two and a half hours, they played an astonishing 42 songs, many of them medley-style, with nearly no banter in between. Amid the most familiar stuff &#8212; &#8220;California Girls,&#8221; &#8220;Surfin&#8217; Safari,&#8221; &#8220;Good Vibrations&#8221; &#8212; were a healthy number of deep cuts and covers, including &#8220;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&#8221; and Phil Spector&#8217;s &#8220;Then He Kissed Me,&#8221; which Jardine probably wisely rephrased as &#8220;Then I Kissed Her.&#8221; There were also two uncanny video appearances by Carl and Dennis Wilson, both of whom died years ago. (Dennis &#8220;sang&#8221; &#8220;Forever,&#8221; while Carl took on &#8220;God Only Knows,&#8221; a song Brian wrote for him on 1966&#8242;s Pet Sounds.) And about halfway through the second set, something new showed up: A reflective midtempo ballad called &#8220;That&#8217;s Why God Made the Radio&#8221; &#8212; a moment that, like so much of the band&#8217;s best music, elevated the adolescent to the divine.

The five young men of The Wanted take on their baby-faced rivals One Direction with their self-titled debut EP released this week, following One Direction&#8217;s No. 1 first album on the U.S. Billboard charts last month. It&#8217;s more than 10 years since New Kids on the Block, Backstreet Boys and N&#8217;Sync ruled the U.S. music scene and sent hordes of screaming young girls to record stores. In Britain, boy bands have never gone out of fashion, although the new breed appears to have grown up. If One Direction are the co-ordinated, clean-cut, media-savvy boy band, The Wanted are the rebellious antidote, uncensored by their team and left to win over audiences by goofing around with each other, and the media. &#8220;We&#8217;re different, we all play instruments, we don&#8217;t dance and we don&#8217;t dress very well,&#8221; The Wanted&#8217;s Tom Parker told Reuters. The Wanted &#8211; Parker, Max George, Siva Kaneswaran, Jay McGuiness and Nathan Sykes, aged between 19 and 23 &#8211; were put together after mass auditions in the U.K. in 2009, and are managed by Scooter Braun, the mastermind behind Canadian teen idol Justin Bieber. &#8220;All the acts that I manage are built organically and they all get to be exactly who they are,&#8221; said Braun, 30, who encourages The Wanted to be open about drinking, partying and dating girls. &#8220;I used to be a party promoter the last time boy bands were huge, and I knew a lot of those guys, and they like to party and drink and do all that stuff too. But they always had to hide it, and I think it&#8217;s refreshing to see a boy band that doesn&#8217;t hide it and that doesn&#8217;t care,&#8221; Braun added. One Direction &#8211; formed of Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan, all aged between 18 and 20 &#8211; were put together in 2010, and are managed by Simon Cowell. One Direction&#8217;s image is more carefully groomed and choreographed in the vein of the boy band stereotype but that didn&#8217;t stop a controversial romance between Styles and a British TV presenter 15 years his senior, prior to the band making their U.S. debut. &#8220;We don&#8217;t mind at all being called a boy band, we&#8217;re just lads in a band. But I think we&#8217;re trying to do something a little bit different&#8230;it&#8217;s a bit more relaxed, lads having fun, we do what we want,&#8221; said One Direction&#8217;s Payne. Both bands fall squarely into the pop genre, with One Direction embracing innocent, fun love songs such as with their lead single &#8220;What Makes You Beautiful,&#8221; which peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Wanted have taken a more adult route, with heavier dance beats and raunchier music videos such as their single &#8220;Glad You Came,&#8221; peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. &#8220;Their music is really different to ours and I think anyone can see that, and you can like one or the other or both,&#8221; said The Wanted&#8217;s McGuiness. &#8220;A lot of people expect boy bands to cater music exclusively to young girls&#8230;we accept that a lot of young girls do like us, but we respect their musical choice as much as we respect a 50-year-old dude,&#8221; McGuiness added. DIRECTIONERS VS. TEAM WANTED The Wanted have received mixed critical reviews for their debut EP in the United States, released this week. August Brown at the Los Angeles Times said that while The Wanted were &#8220;saucier and sleeker&#8221; than One Direction, their music wasn&#8217;t &#8220;nearly as fun,&#8221; while Maura Johnston at Rolling Stone said &#8220;their dance pop droops where it should bounce.&#8221; Devoted fans, known as &#8220;Directioners&#8221; and &#8220;Team Wanted,&#8221; compete on Twitter to make the bands a trending topic, and have been a fundamental part in driving sales. &#8220;As much as we don&#8217;t try to be perfect all the time, we knew America had an idea of boy bands&#8230;we have to thank them because they welcomed us with open arms, and we could never have expected it,&#8221; said McGuiness. One Direction&#8217;s first album, &#8220;Up All Night,&#8221; sold more than 176,000 copies in its first week, entering the Billboard 200 album chart at No. 1 and making history as the first UK band to debut at the top with their first album. The Wanted also look set to chart high, currently at No. 7 on iTunes. One Direction has more than 5 million fans on Facebook and 3.2 million &#8220;Directioners&#8221; following on Twitter, while The Wanted have more than 1.6 million fans on Facebook and 500,000 Twitter followers. Parker from The Wanted called the adulation &#8220;pretty weird at times&#8221; and Horan from One Direction admitted he gets a &#8220;bit scared&#8221; when their female fan base are driven into a frenzy. Manager Braun brushes off critics who dismiss boy bands as mere manufactured creations. &#8220;People forget that the Beatles were once a cheesy boy band &#8211; that&#8217;s what America other than the teenage girls thought. But then they kept making great records&#8230;when you make great songs, everyone else just shuts up,&#8221; said Braun. 10 Comments &#187; Jennifer Lopez to Go On World Tour With EnriqueIglesias Posted in Music , Music news with tags Enrique Iglesias , Jennifer Lopez , world tour on April 17, 2012 by thebestmusicnow Jennifer Lopez is hitting the road this summer, and she&#8217;s taking Enrique Iglesias with her.
