By Calvin Kim January 9, 2012 / Photos by John Lamm Photos Video As we reported earlier, Hyundai has released a thoroughly refreshed Genesis Coupe to the media at the North American International Auto Show . Based on our preliminary assessment, the Genesis Coupe finally has enough under the skin to tickle the fancy of rear-wheel-drive sports car aficionados.  A big boost to the Coupe's credibility comes from improved powerplants. In short, both engines have been reworked to provide increased power. The 3.8-liter V-6 gains direct injection and an anti-knock system to help the engine run as efficiently as possible even with regular pump gas. Use premium fuel and the gains are impressive: 348 bhp at 6400 rpm (an increase of 42 bhp) and 295 lb.-ft. of torque at 5300 rpm. The all-aluminum 2.0-liter four also gets a refresh and a corresponding bump in power. A twin-scroll turbocharger is fitted, as is a larger intercooler. The net result of these changes is serious power upgrade: 274 bhp @ 6000 rpm (a 64-bhp bump) and 275 lb.-ft. of torque at 2000 rpm.  2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe Both engines will be mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, and for those who only want two pedals in the footwell, a Hyundai-built 8-speed paddle-shift automatic transmission will also be available. Enhancing track performance, the R-Spec and Track trim levels will benefit from a Torsen limited slip differential.  2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe In addition to the LSD, the R-Spec and Track models will come with camber adjustment bolts for the front MacPherson struts. They will allow for 1.5 degrees of negative camber for more front grip. The speed-sensitive variable-assist hydraulic steering rack has been quickened by 7 percent, and when combined with the additional camber, improves front-end feel and turn-in.  2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe Along with the mechanical changes, the Coupe receives a brand new front fascia and hood, new 18- and 19-in. wheel choices, and LED daytime running lamps and taillights. The interior updates include a new gauge cluster, revised materials and Hyundai's Blue Link system. All told, the 2013 Genesis Coupe aims to add life to the currently stagnant mid-level sports car market, but is it too little too late?  2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe Share Your Thoughts Related Stories 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe - 2012 Detroit Auto Show Preview Hottest Coupes in Motown - 2012 Detroit Auto Show Photos: 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe Hyundai Elantra, Land Rover Evoque Take North American Car /Truck Honors - 2012 Detroit Auto Show Photos: The Real Spin: 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe Auto Show Reveal The Real Spin: 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe Mazda MX-5 Miata vs Subaru BRZ vs Hyundai Genesis Coupe - Comparison Test (TEST)  Share 0  0 Email  Connect With Road &amp; Track  Road &amp; Track Today Future Car News Are these the specs for the new Alfa Romeo 4C?
