A little boy asked his teacher if he could go to the bathroom, so she said yes. When he went to wipe his fanny, there was no toilet paper, so he used his hand. In his haste to get back to class he forgot to wash, so he made a closed fist to hide it. When he got back to class, his teacher asked, &quot;What do you have in your hand?&quot; The boy said, &quot;A little leprechaun, and if I open my hand he'll get scared away.&quot; He was then sent to the principal's office and the principal asked him, &quot;what do you have in your hand?&quot; So the little boy said, &quot;A little leprechaun, and if I open my hand he'll get scared away.&quot; He was then sent home and his Mom asked him, &quot;What do you have in your hand?&quot; So again the little boy said, &quot;A little leprechaun and if I open my hand he will get scared away.&quot; Then his Mom got really mad and yelled, &quot;Open your hand NOW!&quot; And the little boy said, &quot;oh great Mom, now look what you did, you scared the crap out of him!&quot;   City-Data Forum Message Cancel Changes  Quick Reply  The following errors occurred with your submission Okay Message:  Posting Quick Reply - Please Wait &laquo; Previous Thread | Next Thread &raquo;  City-Data Forum &gt; General Forums &gt; Entertainment and Arts Similar Threads Do you like humor old than you? , Entertainment and Arts, 10 replies A little bit of humor.
