 Experience gave filmmaker new perspective

 CHAMPAIGN — When Roger Ebert first heard of the premise of "Kumare," he assumed the documentary would be a "satirical, snarky comedy" like Sacha Baron Cohen's "Borat." 
 But not so, Ebert wrote in his August 2012 review of the movie, which will be shown at 2 p.m. Saturday as part of the 15th annual Roger Ebert's Film Festival at the Virginia Theatre.

 In early March, monster trumpeter Arturo Sandoval sent a tweet to a younger but equally awesome trumpeter, Alison Balsom: 
 "Italian Concertos. Congratulations, dear Alison, you are simply amazing." 
 He then suggested the two of them play duets. Looks like that might happen.

 Richard J. Leskosky: Multiple roles nothing new in film 
 Sun, 04/14/2013 - 6:00am  |  Richard J. Leskosky 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The cinema enthralls us with illusions within illusions, and even the most obvious can quickly become complicated. Take acting, for example. It's basically a performer pretending to be someone else, and that in itself can be extremely nuanced and complex. But sometimes that complexity derives simply from the fact that one actor portrays more than one character, often at the same time.
