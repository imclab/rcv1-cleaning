I thought I had my 6 week line-up ready to go.(your Giraffes Can&#39;t Dance being one of my projects.) But I am always open for some last minute changes. (BTW &#8211; I am loving the lesson on those beautiful watercolor birds as well.) Thank you and Happy New Year! Mary Reply  Patty P says: January 10, 2010 at 10:20 am Fantastic! I love incorporating books into my lessons as much as possible. Love &quot;giraffes&quot;. A perennial favorite.
