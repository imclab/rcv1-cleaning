For style, there&#39;s little to separate the front and rear of the Elantra Coupe from its Sedan sibling, and with its flowing roofline and high rear deck, the sedan also looks a little sportier. Still, the emotional appeal of a proper two-door coupe (rather than a sedan made to look like one) can&#39;t be denied, and Hyundai expects the Elantra Coupe to sway more than a few Civic Coupe buyers to the Korean side. To give it a slight style edge over the Sedan, the Elantra Coupe gets a few extra highlights and sharper triangular fog lights up front, along with twin exhaust tips and a larger diffuser-inspired insert in the rear bumper.  Don&#39;t expect any extra juice under the bonnet, either. Power is provided by the same 110kW 1.8 litre four-cylinder engine available with the Sedan, matched to a six-speed automatic transmission. Standard features in the Elantra Coupe include a seven-inch touchscreen nav system and reversing camera, Bluetooth, iPod and USB connectivity, keyless entry and engine start, six airbags, ESC and electronic brake-force distribution. Available in left-hand-drive only, the Elantra Coupe is not expected to make a local debut. With the new Veloster now on sale, we imagine Hyundai Australia is perfectly fine with the situation.
