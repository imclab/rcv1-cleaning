   The state of Maryland designated downtown Bethesda as an Arts &amp; Entertainment District effective July 1, 2002. The Bethesda Urban Partnership is the manager of the Bethesda's Arts &amp; Entertainment District. 
             In 2004, the Bethesda Arts &amp; Entertainment District Board was granted 501 (c) (3) status by the IRS.&nbsp; This allows the Board to fundraise, as a not-for-profit organization, and build awareness for new arts &amp; Entertainment projects in downtown Bethesda.&nbsp; Our Mission Statement is: &quot;The Bethesda Arts &amp; Entertainment District Board shall create and implement arts and entertainment projects that contribute to the artistic, cultural and economic growth of downtown Bethesda&quot;. 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
            From award-winning theatre to independent films, Bethesda's Arts &amp; Entertainment District is filled with inspiring artists and arts venues. Unique galleries and public art fill the streets throughout the downtown. The Art &amp; Soul of Bethesda arts publication details arts organizations, public art, cinemas and live theatre present within downtown Bethesda's Arts &amp; Entertainment District. 
 
 
 Watch for announcements for exciting, new art projects in Bethesda coming soon!
