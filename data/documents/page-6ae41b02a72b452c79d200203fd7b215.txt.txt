Or was it love after life after life? Whatev. All we’re sayin’ is the legendary singer and actress, Cher recently encountered a disorderly fan and we do mean disorderly. A 36 year-old Nashville man, Calvin Hutton Houghland was asked to leave a club where Cher was performing (as for the location? The infamous Tootsies Orchid Lounge. Marvy!) After initially complying he returned and grabbed the Cherster by the waist as she chilled in a sectioned off area of the lounge. He was charged with disorderly conduct and public intoxication. Now we bet he wishes he could turn back time! (haha!) This entry was posted in Cher , Entertainment news and tagged celebrity fans , Cher by Vicki .
