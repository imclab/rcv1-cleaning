As a little girl, Jill Oriane Tarlau told a tall one about a witch kicked out of her coven because she couldn't bear to scare anyone. Tarlau's grandmother, a short-story writer, was delighted by the tale. She typed it up, popped it in a black folder and presented it to the girl, with some fanfare. That was one of many small but significant moments that prefigured Tarlau's future as a creator of beautiful books. In 1986, she left the Bay Area for Paris to practice the art of bookbinding. Now, with technology poised to render bound books obsolete (if you believe the hype), one-of-a-kind books handmade by artists like Tarlau stand out. Her signature is her exquisitely detailed embroidery, which she incorporates into the design of each uniquely sized, leather-bound book cover. She considers embroidered bookbindings to be her special contribution to the long history of the art of book making. "I like making things with my hands," she said, sitting in the sunny gallery of Arion Press in the Presidio, where a show of her books -- "Jill Oriane Tarlau: Embroidered Bindings," sponsored by the nonprofit Grabhorn Institute and the Book Club of California -- is on view through April 13. Originally, she had wanted to be a writer. "It's not like Moses came to me in a dream and told me to be a bookbinder, but I was good at it," she said, with a laugh. "Before, there was no way I could account for my time." With bookbinding, "I advanced something every day -- and nobody else could have done it." The current exhibition includes bindings for books that range from childhood writings of her daughters Kim, Margot and Hilary, to special editions of works by Lewis Carroll , Basho, Oscar Wilde , Edgar Allen Poe and the poet James Merrill , her cousin by marriage and a close friend. Each project begins with the loose leaves of a printed, but unbound book. She sews the pages together, a complex and time-consuming process, and mounts them between pieces of heavy cardboard that she then covers with exotic skins (ostrich, snake, buffalo, carp), inset with her embroidered letters or illustrations. Since each step requires close, meticulous work and the bindings must be pressed in vise-like devices to set their shape at various points, the process of making just one book can take years. Tarlau is considered unusually prolific: She has made 200 books in 21 years. Hers is a dramatic success story. At age 40, she started a whole new life after she and her husband, Peter Magowan , owner of the Giants and former chief executive officer of Safeway, divorced. "My youngest child was going away to school," she said. "I wanted to make the rest of my life useful." A native New Yorker , she had first come to California to attend Mills College in 1962. She returned to Mills in the '80s, earning a master's degree in book arts. Determined to study bookbinding in the city where that art still thrives, she moved to Paris in 1986, setting up a studio in the Sixth Arrondissement and studying with professional bookbinders. Soon, European collectors were drawn to her books (which sell for several thousand dollars each), and her work was exhibited at the Bibliotheque Nationale de Luxembourg, the Bibliotheque Wittockiana in Brussels and the New York Public Library . In Paris, she lived like a monk, working mornings and evenings, studying and running errands in the afternoons. "I walked everywhere, even in winter in the rain or snow," she said, recalling "the pleasure of finding yourself on a new street in Paris." The competitive world of French bookbinding is not notably welcome to outsiders. In light of this, Thomas Goldwasser of Thomas A. Goldwasser Rare Books in San Francisco, who has sold her books to collectors and libraries, admires her grit. "What's remarkable about Jill's career is how her passionate determination and her skill and imagination as a bookbinder brought her to the attention of French bibliophiles, a snobbish and demanding group who would not normally take note of the work of an American woman," Goldwasser said. After two decades of perfecting her art, Tarlau has returned to San Francisco, where her three daughters and their families live. "I don't just want to take my grandchildren out to dinner once a year," she said. "I want to be part of my children's and grandchildren's lives." At the same time, she has announced her retirement from bookbinding, largely because she believes that the art can best be done in France. "In Paris, there are all the people who specialize," she explained, "those who do just the tooling in leather, just the gilding, just the engraving." There are artisans who do nothing but pare leather to order, to make skins thin enough to use in bindings. Still, Tarlau said, "I want people to know about bookbinding." To that end, she has returned to writing, her early love. And there in the gallery of Arion Press, at the center of a large round table, sits a green manuscript box. Inside is a novel based on her time in Paris. Its title? "Bindings." Jill Oriane Tarlau: Embroidered Bindings: 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m., Mon.-Fri., through April 13 in the gallery of Arion Press, 1802 Hays St., the Presidio, San Francisco. (415) 668-2542, www.arionpress.com .
