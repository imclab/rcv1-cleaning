 What is a Degree in Arts, Entertainment, and Media Mgt? 
 Getting an education in arts, entertainment, and media management will prepare the student to oversee artists in various forms of artistic expression as an administrator.&nbsp; Some of the fields that these administrators work in include: 
 
 the performing arts 
 visual art galleries 
 music promotion and distribution 
 sports management 
 other various forms of the artistic media 
 
 The role that arts, entertainment, and media managers plays in the creation and promotion of art is vital to an artist's success, as managers will have to combine both a passion and understanding of the art with the knowledge of good business practices in order to ensure that the artist's goals are reached. 
 Students who wish to enter the arts, entertainment, and media management fields will have to earn a deeper understanding and appreciation for the arts, while also learning what it takes practically to be a good business manager and promoter.&nbsp; Students will sometimes pursue a  degree  concentrated on a specific field (such as visual arts, or sports management) that will prepare them to manage a particular art form, while others will refrain from choosing a concentration, studying the basics of managing in a variety of different arts, entertainment, and media related fields. Students will also learn how to analyze and approach modern society with the arts in light of the world's ever-changing social, economic, political, and cultural attitudes.&nbsp; Arts, entertainment, and media management students will likely have to study marketing techniques, fund-raising, and legal information associated with their specific field. 
 Like many degrees in today's technologically advanced world, students can now get an education in arts, entertainment, and media management via  online college  courses or via traditional, face-to-face learning facilities.&nbsp; Not all schools are going to offer the same type of management courses, so students interested in applying to one of these programs should be sure that the school they choose has a program specifically geared toward their career goals.&nbsp; For example, if a student hopes to work with painters, sculptors, museums, or art galleries, they should be sure to find a school that offers a visual arts management or other field-specific program. 
 Arts, entertainment, and media management programs are offered in a full spectrum of educational levels, including certificate,  associate's degree ,  bachelor's degree ,  master's degree , and even  doctorate degree  programs.&nbsp; Many schools, however, offer only one or two field-specific arts, entertainment, and media management programs and expect students to choose an area of concentration. 
 Career Opportunities for Arts, Entertainment, and Media Mgt 
 Someone who has earned an education in arts, entertainment, and media management has a wide variety of career options available to them.&nbsp; Those educated in this field can become: 
 
 arts consultants 
 show coordinators 
 fund-raising directors 
 managers of various theaters and productions 
 broadcast and print media managers 
 ...and much more 
 
 According to the the Bureau of Labor Statistics, managers in the arts, entertainment, and recreation field make up only 5% of the total industry, and someone who hopes to earn a high-level management position will likely need to get at least a bachelor's degree first.&nbsp; Some entry-level supervisory positions are available, however, to those who complete an associate's degree program.&nbsp; Most of the fields covered under the arts, entertainment, and recreation umbrella are expected to grow slightly faster than average over the next few years, but the majority of jobs will be in entry-level, sub-management positions.
