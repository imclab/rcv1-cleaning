September 2012 BY  TONY SWAN Suzuki&rsquo;s press conference was the curtain-raising act of the 2012 Paris auto show , and this demure compact crossover was its headliner. Suzuki hasn&rsquo;t had much in the way of new-product news lately, particularly in the U.S., but according to global sales managing officer Kenichi Ayukawa, the S-Cross will mark the beginning of a wave of launches that will proceed at a rate of one per year in Europe for the next few years. Speculation had the production S-Cross as the likely replacement for the SX4 hatchback , but it&rsquo;s likely going to join the lineup alongside that diminutive all-wheel driver. Might whatever the S-Cross becomes be enlisted to shore up Suzuki&rsquo;s rapidly fading U.S. fortunes? Let&rsquo;s defer the answer to that proposition for a bit later. Limited Specs First, let&rsquo;s check the specs, an exercise that won&rsquo;t take much time because Suzuki didn&rsquo;t provide very many. Basically a typical front-drive crossover design with all-wheel-drive capability, the S-Cross rides a 102.4-inch wheelbase and is 169.7 inches long. Width is 72.4 inches, and height is 63.0 inches. That&rsquo;s at the smallish end of the compact-class scale, although it&rsquo;s a size that makes sense for European and Asian markets.  Aside from those basic dimensions, though, the S-Cross is a bit of a mystery. Beyond a passing mention of all-wheel drive, there was no discussion of the powertrain, for example. The obvious guess is a four-cylinder engine and a choice of manual or automatic transmissions. Output is another unknown, but given Suzuki&rsquo;s penchant for keeping price and operating costs low, we&rsquo;d bet on modest. Like other players in this segment, Suzuki undoubtedly will aim high on fuel economy. We think. Image a Reality Check The exterior design is not unpleasant, with its sinusoidal character line down the side, and the front skid plate and 20-inch chrome wheels add a soup&#231;on of macho to the matrix. We&rsquo;re told the cargo hold is generous by class standards, and that the car&rsquo;s features and functions are &ldquo;designed primarily for comfort.&rdquo; Suzuki also claims the concept&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crystal Green Metallic&rdquo; exterior evokes an image of &ldquo;nature in the city and the city in nature.&rdquo; Aside from someone getting hellaciously lost and parking their S-Cross on a Central Park sidewalk, we&rsquo;re not sure how that works. While we pondered that possibility, we cornered Mr. Ayukawa and asked whether we&rsquo;d see the S-Cross in U.S. showrooms. Mr. Ayukawa refrained from eye contact, looking down at his notes before answering: &ldquo;At this moment,&rdquo; he replied cautiously, &ldquo;we have no plans. In the future we will see.&rdquo; OK.
