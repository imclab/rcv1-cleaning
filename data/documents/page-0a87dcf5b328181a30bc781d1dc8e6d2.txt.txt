Thumbs Up Thumbs Down  Marked as spam, commented by Jan | Delete kaatskill commented 1 year ago Reply | Spam Why ,when you click on the History or TruTV other shows appear instead of Pawn Stars etc. iON TV or a cartoon shows up instead,also AE,History,TruTV rarely work any more especially in the evening and early am.(1-3am) Are they being filtered out by the networks?
