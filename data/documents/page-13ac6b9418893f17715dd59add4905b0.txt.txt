Hilaria ducked into a local tea store to avoid the pap and Alec called the police. I guess Alec must have come out of the store because apparently he grabbed the photog. TMZ spoke to the pap who said  &#8220;All I can say is I was doing my job asking him normal questions and he flipped. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;  although a source close to Baldwin claims that the paparazzi was the agressor. The police did arrive on the scene but both Alec and the photographer have agreed to not press any charges.  I can absolutely believe that the paparazzi was aggressive and that Alec would be protective of his wife.   She just a baby a few days ago ! I wonder if the baby was with them? Either way I think that photographers should be able to take their pictures but there&#8217;s no need to get so close and speak to the celebrities if they don&#8217;t want to be bothered. Thoughts?

Posted on August 27, 2013 at 2:30 PM Sunday night&#8217;s VMA&#8217;s gave us just a short N&#8217;Sync reunion, but rehearsing for those 15 seconds on stage was enough to remind the band members - Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, JC Chasez and Justin Timberlake, just what they loved and hated about each other!  In a radio interview about the performance Chris Kirkpatrick said   &#8220;It was funny because all of us getting back together, we remembered what we love about each other and what we hate about each other,&#8221; the singer, 41, said. &#8220;It was just a bit of fun.&#8221; It also doesn&#8217;t sound like Chris is too eager to do it again! He addressed the physicality of the performance and said  &#8220;Honestly, when he talked to us I thought we were just coming out with mic stands and singing. When I came home from rehearsals my girl&#8217;s like &#8216;Why are you drenched?&#8217; . . .I&#8217;m too old for this! I was so worried about not messing up for him.&#8221; Ha!  It did kind of look like they were a bit out of shape:)  I enjoyed the performance though!

The actress, who spends most of her time in London these days (she does a lot of promotional work throughout Europe), was spotted going out for lunch with her cute little dog while in Los Feliz, Calif. on Monday afternoon.

The actress recently spoke about her ex-husband Scott Foley , whether she would ever do Botox, and who is her go-to &#8220;mama gal&#8221; in a new interview Allure . Here are some highlights: On whether she would do Botox I’m old enough to know policies don’t necessarily last, so be careful what box you stand on. [It may be time to try Botox but she's a little scared] because I have a big forehead, and I don’t want it to be like this slab, a big glacier. On her first husband, Scott Foley Oh he’s a great guy. We were full-on grown ups, but looking back I’m aware we did not know what hit us. We didn’t have a shot. He’s a really good guy, and we just imploded. On Reese Witherspoon Reese is one of my go-to mamas. She has such a big heart and a good head on her shoulders. She’s one of the people I go to and say, “Hey, what do you do about X, Y, Z,” and she always has an answer. On her haircare routine I have no idea how women who go to an office in the morning do it. I don’t use hair-care products, and I don’t blow dry. I don’t even know where the blow dryer is. So the thought of having to incorporate that into my morning just seems crazy to me. On if she talks beauty with her girlfriends If I get to sit down with my girlfriends, and I’m happy to include Jessica [Biel] among them. It’s hard not to talk beauty if you’re sitting with Jessica Biel because she is the most gorgeous person on the planet.

Hey, it gives him an extended fifteen minutes, right? The former boy bander was spotted enjoying a night out with friends while at Madeo Restaurant in Hollywood, Calif. on Monday evening. It&#8217;s just too bad that Joey won&#8217;t be able to reunite with Justin Timberlake and the boys again for a reunion tour . Now that would be incredibly awesome if it did work out.

Simon Cowell &#8216;s baby mama Lauren Silverman was spotted doing a little shopping while she was out and about in St. Tropez on Tuesday afternoon. Lauren is currently vacationing in the South of France with Simon and from what we&#8217;re hearing a few of his ex-girlfriends, too. Do you think Lauren and Simon have what it takes to take their relationship to the next level? Considering how they started off, I&#8217;m not too sure. Here&#8217;s just hoping that Simon hangs on long enough do at least he and Lauren are still together when the baby is born. Wishful thinking, I know! Tell us, can you see Lauren&#8217;s baby bump in any of these pics?
