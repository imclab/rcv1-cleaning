Tweet | marc.noordeloos User| Posts: 174| Joined: 10/06 Posted: 09/03/08 07:56 AM I was driving a BMW 128i convertible last night and I couldn't stop thinking that it is more expensive than a 128i coupe, heavier, and not as good looking. More importantly, it doesn't handle or drive as well as the coupe. So, what are you thoughts on convertibles? Do you love the sun so much that the compromises are worth while? Do you think the compromises are less severe than many journalists think? Jimmy Pham Administrator| Posts: 1| Joined: 08/08 Posted: 09/03/08 05:02 PM Personally if I had a choice between a car either coupe of convertible, it would have to be coupe all the way. Usually the coupe is where all the performance testing was orginally done and when they're finished with that, they chop off the top to make it convertible. Very few cars are made to be convertible, Honda S2000, Mazda Miatas, Pontia Solstice/Saturn Sky, BMW Z4, etc. Those cars are meant to be convertible so they're optimized. But then there's cars that have been optimized for both coupe and convertible/roadster like the Ferrari F430. marc.noordeloos User| Posts: 174| Joined: 10/06 Posted: 09/04/08 08:18 AM Thanks, all good points and I agree. I prefer a Boxster over a 911 Cab due to the same logic. Sure, the Cayman dulls that theory but the Boxster came first. I think the only "convertible" I like more than the coupe is an Elise over an Exige. I like the open feeling and the ease of entry offered by the Elise. Plus, the Exige isn't any more rigid. Regarding the F430, I see the spider as far less cool than the coupe, no matter how similarly they drive. If Ferrari offered a 430 Scuderia with a proper manual 'box, it just might be my dream (modern) car.

Want speed and handling go coupe Want them watching or a real relaxing refreshing ride go convertible. Best to have one of each in the barn even if one of them is older, and that could be the convertible. bob3rt New User| Posts: 6| Joined: 07/08 Posted: 09/11/08 05:12 PM I would also take into consideration where you live. If the weather is bad then probably buy a coupe, but if its nice and sunny all the time then buy a convertible. Either way, I don't think any of the convertible trims are that different from the coupes. They either both look ugly or both look nice.
