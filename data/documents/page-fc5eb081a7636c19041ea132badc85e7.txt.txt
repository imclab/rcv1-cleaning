 Galveston's visual and performing arts culture continues to thrive as visitors browse through art galleries during the day before heading out at night to catch their favorite musicals in the heart of Historic Galveston Island. 
 
 The Grand 1894 Opera House 
 
 
 The Grand has a very special place in the history of our community and in the lives of many of our residents.    
 In 1993 the 73rd Texas Legislature proclaimed The Grand "The Official Opera House of Texas."
 
 
 
 In fact, arts  and entertainment are as much a part of the Island&rsquo;s  history  as its port and  Victorian architecture. From theater, music and dance, in historic and traditional  settings, to reggae, rock, country and the oldies in the city&rsquo;s nightspots,  Galveston sparkles at night. 
 Postoffice Street Arts &amp; Entertainment District  is nestled in the famous  Strand National Historic Landmark District , only three short blocks from The Strand. This district is home to quaint  galleries  that feature various types of art from local, national and internationally recognized artists.  Every six weeks, the art galleries welcome Island visitors and Galvestonians alike into their galleries for ArtWalk; an event that provides visitors with wine and cheese while leading them through the historic streets and into boutiques and galleries. 
 The Grand 1894 Opera House  presents  a year-round performing arts schedule featuring international stars of stage  and screen, Broadway musicals, dance, music and comedy productions. Called &ldquo;one  of the finest theaters in the world&rdquo; by veteran actor Hal Holbrook, The Grand  is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated the  &ldquo;official opera house of the State of Texas&rdquo; by the 73rd legislature. Past  performers have included Bill Cosby, Gregory Peck, James Earl Jones, Bernadette  Peters, and Willie Nelson. The Grand also presented the world premier  production of  Red, White and Tuna , as well as  Tuna Does Vegas . 
 Island etc (east-end theater company)  strives to present innovative and cutting-edge 
					  productions by both known and new playwrights. The  elegant 200-seat theatre is home to plays, musicals, concerts and film  festivals year-round.  
 If  it&rsquo;s a just-released motion picture you would like to see,  Premiere Cinema , a  multi-screen theater, is conveniently located on Seawall Boulevard at 89th  Street. 
 From Broadway to dance to visual arts, Galveston Island is a art-lover's paradise.
