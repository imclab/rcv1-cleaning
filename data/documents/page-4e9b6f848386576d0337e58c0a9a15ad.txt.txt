HIGHLIGHTS OF 2011 GENESIS COUPE : * Interior refinements  o New soft-touch, matte-finish surfaces on door panels, center speaker grille, glove box, and lower instrument panel  o New dark metalgrain accents on center stack, door handles, air vent register bezels and steering wheel trim  o Padded door armrests  o Softer, premium steering wheel leather  o Cloth-wrapped A-pillars  o Chrome finish for A/T shift gate bezel and center stack control knobs  o Chrome finish gauge cluster rings  o Rear coat hooks  o Trunk deck lid grab handle  o Enhanced multi-information display screen graphics * 3.8 R-Spec model added * Navigation with Full Automatic Temperature Control now standard on Genesis Coupe 2.0T Premium * Revised model lineup featuring six flavors of Genesis Coupe: 2.0T, 2.0T Premium, 2.0T R-Spec, 3.8 R-Spec, 3.8 Grand Touring, 3.8 Track INTERIOR DESIGN For 2011, Genesis Coupe features several interior upgrades that reflect Hyundai’s commitment to craftsmanship and high-quality materials. The instrument panel is crafted in a seamless, soft-touch skin fully encompassing new dark metalgrain trim. Softer leather now wraps the steering wheel and padding has been added to the door armrests for increased comfort. The A-pillars are now covered in a premium fabric to match the roof liner. New information screen graphics enhance appearance and readability and the finish of the controls has also been enhanced. “The interior upgrades, our hot new 3.8 R-Spec model, and revised lineup of six focused models show that Hyundai is meeting the demands of our customers,” said Scott Margason, director, product planning, Hyundia Motor America. “The upgraded interior is a great illustration of how Hyundai continually raises its own high benchmarks for quality." 2011 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 2011 GENESIS COUPE HIGHLIGHTS: * 306-horsepower from enhanced 3.8-liter V6 from Genesis sedan * 210-horsepower turbocharged, intercooled inline four cylinder * Platform-mate and sinister sibling of the Car of the Year-winning Genesis sedan Genesis Coupe is Hyundai’s most dynamic performance car, appealing directly to the true driving enthusiast. Genesis Coupe uses the same flexible rear-wheel drive architecture developed for the Genesis sport sedan. POWERTRAINS Two engines infuse Genesis Coupe with performance. The 3.8-liter Lambda DOHC V6 engine delivers 306-horsepower and 266 lb.-ft. of torque on regular unleaded. This engine will launch the Genesis Coupe from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 5.5 seconds. To maximize the power band, the 3.8-liter engine utilizes DCVVT and a new Variable Intake System (VIS) that helps cylinders breathe more efficiently at both low and high RPM. The better-breathing results in outstanding off-the-line acceleration, passing performance and remarkable fuel efficiency. The V6 engine uses an alloy block and cylinder heads for lighter weight and thermal efficiency and features durable timing chains with no scheduled maintenance. The turbocharged, intercooled 2.0-liter DOHC inline four-cylinder benefits from Dual CVVT on both the intake and exhaust camshafts. The 2.0-liter turbo generates 210-horsepower and 223 lb.-ft. of torque. It also features a cast-aluminum cylinder block and cylinder head. Both engines feature a free-flowing dual cat-back exhaust and an available Torsen® limited-slip differential to put the power to the ground. SPORT-TUNED SUSPENSION Genesis Coupe employs a MacPherson® strut dual-link front suspension and a five-link independent rear suspension setup. The front suspension is mounted to the body via a solid subframe which is lighter and stronger than a multi-piece component would be. To help reduce body roll and tune the Genesis Coupe’s at-the-limit handling for maximum predictability, 24-mm diameter front and 19-mm diameter rear stabilizer bars are used. While all Genesis Coupe models offer a sporty and involving driving experience, the high-performance Genesis Coupe R-Spec and 3.8 Track models are the most willing partners for the true enthusiast. The track-tuned suspension features a stiffer front spring rate, stiffer rear spring rate and unique shock valving. The Genesis Coupe R-Spec and 3.8 Track models deliver a substantial increase in roll control over standard versions of the Genesis Coupe. Superb structural rigidity sets the foundation for precisely-tuned handling performance in all Genesis Coupes. TRANSMISSIONS Both engines are mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission. The Genesis Coupe 2.0T offers an optional five-speed automatic with SHIFTRONIC® while the 3.8-liter V6 offers a ZF® six-speed automatic transmission with SHIFTRONIC to handle the additional torque. Both automatic transmissions feature steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. HIGH PERFORMANCE BRAKING SYSTEMS Brembo four-piston calipers clamp down on 13.4-inch ventilated front brake rotors and 13-inch ventilated rear rotors on R-Spec and 3.8 Track models. All other models get substantial 12.6-inch front ventilated rotors and 12.4-inch rotors in the rear with floating single-piston calipers. INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES The 2011 Genesis Coupe 3.8 Track offers Xenon high-intensity discharge (HID) headlights. The advantages of HID headlamps include greater lighting power, daylight-type lighting and reduced power consumption. Music lovers will welcome the 2011 Genesis Coupe’s standard auxiliary input jacks (3.5 mm mini-jack and USB input) to accommodate and charge audio devices such as iPods®. There is an optional in-dash navigation unit with a multi-gauge information display screen. This system provides new features including Bluetooth streaming audio capability. This easy-to-use unit can be controlled via 6.5-inch WVGA touchscreen or voice-recognition by headliner-mounted microphone. SEGMENT-LEADING SAFETY TECHNOLOGIES In keeping with Hyundai’s focus on offering segment-leading standard safety technologies across its lineup, the 2011 Genesis Coupe includes a wide range of both active and passive safety features. Standard safety technologies include driver and front passenger advanced frontal airbags , along with front seat-mounted side airbags, side air curtains and active front head restraints. All Genesis Coupe models feature standard four-channel ABS with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) to optimize brake performance under various dynamic loading conditions. The system also includes Brake Assist, which provides maximum ABS-level braking force when a panic stop is detected. Electronic Stability Control ( ESC ), one of the industry’s most effective life-saving technologies, is standard in all Genesis Coupe models. WEIGHT EFFICIENCY “One of the program targets for the Genesis engineering team was world-class weight efficiency,” Margason said. “When you look at the size and content of both Genesis models, you’ll find we lead all our competitors in weight efficiency. We also target leadership in power-to-weight ratio. We think that’s just smart strategy in today’s world. It pays huge dividends in both performance and fuel economy, and that’s especially important in the segments in which these cars compete.” Vehicle Engine Curb Weight (lbs.) Length (inches) Genesis sedan 3.8-liter V6 3,748 195.9 Genesis sedan 4.6-liter V8 4,012 195.9 Genesis Coupe 2.0-liter turbo 3,294 182.3 Genesis Coupe 3.8-liter V6 3,389 182.3 Both Genesis Coupe and sedan are rich in ultra-high-strength steel, leading to world-class body rigidity. The Genesis sedan is 10-12 percent stiffer in torsion than its Lexus and Mercedes -Benz competitors, yet it is lighter than these benchmark sedans, and offers more interior room. At just 3,294 pounds, the Genesis Coupe 2.0T is hundreds of pounds lighter than all of its IRS-equipped rear-wheel drive competitors, with body-bending rigidity 24 percent higher than the BMW E46 M3. Vehicle Length (inches) Curb Weight (lbs.) Horsepower Power-to-weight ratio Genesis Coupe 3.8 182.3 3389 306 11.1 BMW 335i 181.1 3560 300 11.9 Infiniti G37 183.1 3627 330 11.0 Camaro LS 190.4 3780 304 12.4 Challenger 197.7 3819 250 15.3 This focus on weight efficiency pays dividends across the board. The Genesis sedan owes its ability to deliver both strong performance (0-60 mph in 5.5 seconds) and excellent fuel economy (25 mpg EPA highway rating) in great part due to its impressive weight efficiency. Similarly, the Genesis Coupe 2.0T sets a high fuel efficiency bar with a remarkable 30 mpg estimated EPA highway rating, because of its weight-efficient platform and its efficient 2.0-liter, low-pressure, turbocharged four-cylinder engine.
