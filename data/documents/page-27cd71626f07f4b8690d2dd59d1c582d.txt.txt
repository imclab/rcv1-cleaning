Looks like Lindsay Lohan will be heading to trial after failing to reach a plea deal over the allegation that she lied to police after being involved in a car crash last year. Lohan faces three charges, including giving false information to a police officer and reckless driving,. These are in relation to the June accident on the Pacific Coast Highway. The troubled star and she had hoped to work out an agreement with the prosecution that would keep her out of jail after her lawyer failed to have the counts dismissed earlier this month, but the negotiations have fallen through and now Lindsay Lohan is expected to appear in court on Monday as a jury trial gets underway, reports the New York Daily News . The three accusations carry a total jail sentence of over 240 days. The incident could also land Lindsay Lohan in even more trouble for violating her probation.

He&#8217;s been clashing with the paparazzi, showing up late for concerts and basically look slike he&#8217;s heading towards some kind of meltdwn. Now Biebs has decided to make the TERRIBLE move of ranting about how all the fault for this belongs to the media on Instagram of all places. In a post, which has since been deleted, Bieber boasts about his success and wealth and even makes a mean-spirited jab at Lindsay Lohan. Justin Bieber  , &#8220;Everyone in my team has been telling me, &#8216;keep the press happy&#8217; but I&#8217;m tired of all the countless lies in the press right now. Saying I&#8217;m going to rehab and how my family is disappointed in me. My family is beyond proud, and nothing&#8217;s been said by them, my grandparents wouldn&#8217;t know how to reach to press even (if) they did want to so that was a lie and rehab cmon. If anyone believes I need rehab thats their own stupidity lol. The pop star continued, &#8220;I&#8217;m 19 with 5 number one albums, 19 and I&#8217;ve seen the whole world. 19 and I&#8217;ve accomplished more than I could&#8217;ve ever dreamed of. I&#8217;m 19 and it must be scary to some people to think that this is just the beginning. I know my talent level and i know I got my head on straight. I know who I am and I know who I&#8217;m not. &#8220;My message is to believe. My albums could be about anything but my messages have been to never say never and believe, not to believe in me, but to believe in yourself&#8230; I honestly don&#8217;t care if you don&#8217;t believe in me because I believe in me, and look where that&#8217;s gotten me so far. Justin Bieber concluded, &#8220;I&#8217;m writing this with a smile on my face and love in my heart. Letting u (you) know first hand how I feel rather than have these story (sic) linger. I&#8217;m a good person with a big heart. And don&#8217;t think I deserve all of this negative press. I&#8217;ve worked my ass off to get where I am and my hard work doesn&#8217;t stop here. I&#8217;m growing up finding myself while having people watch me and criticise me everyday I think im doing pretty damn good. And to those comparing me to Lindsey Lohan look at her 2012 tax statements.&#8221; Justin Bieber &#8230;you are a dick. Grow up. Stop trying to pretend your an artist and embrace the fact that you are a teen sensation who will hopefully fade into obscurity. Never ONCE does he take responsibility for his actions, it&#8217;s all someone else&#8217;s fault. Ugh.

Really Nicki, you don&#8217;t show up a few hours early for a live taping? Her arrival was heralded by several tweets: &#8220;Stuck in traffic *sighs*. Fuck u Malibu!!!!!!!!!!!! *moves to Beverly Hills*.&#8221; As Nicki Minaj was hurrying to make it, Ryan Seacrest told the audience, &#8220;We are coming to you live and on time. Keep that energy going for three of your four judges who are here tonight&#8230; I hear she&#8217;s (Minaj) seven minutes out and there&#8217;s some congestion on the 405 (freeway). She should be here momentarily.&#8221; Nicki Minaj finally arrived 15 minutes into the show, just missing a performance from the first contestant of the night.

Cumberbatch was almost forced to call the police when he discovered that someone was watching him and detailing his movements on the web, but he managed to resolve the issue with the perpetrator privately. The Sherlock star tells Britain&#8217;s Daily Telegraph newspaper, &#8220;I would say that it was the strangest fan experience that I&#8217;ve ever had. I had someone live tweeting my movements while I was in my own house. Benedict Cumberbatch  continues  &#8220;It was such a strange and a direct thing to see these tweets saying what I was doing as I was doing them. I found it really worrying, and, yes, of course, very hard to deal with. I worked out after a while who it was who was doing it so, when it came to it, I didn&#8217;t actually call in the police, but I was prepared to do so. Benedict Cumberbatch adds,&#8221;I&#8217;m not going to say any more about it. The person concerned knows now what I felt about it. I just found it very hard to come to terms with the idea that an individual could look into my house like this, and talk about me online, and think it is a perfectly okay thing to do.&#8221; Posted in Benedict Cumberbatch , Celebrity Gossip , Celebrity News , Celebrity Photos | Leave a comment Veronica Mars Kickstarter Raises Over $2 Million Posted on March 14, 2013 by admin Success!

Game of Thrones star Clarke stars as Holly Golightly in the new Broadway production and reports have been coming in that a scene in the play in which a nude Clarke gets into a bathtub with her co-star, Cory Michael Smith , has audience members whipping out their camera phones to get photos of the actress. But Emilia Clarke has played down the reports, saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s really not quite as exciting as people are making out&#8230; It hasn&#8217;t happened, there really hasn&#8217;t been that many people taking photos of us in the tub&#8230;&#8221; Clarke adds &#8220;There&#8217;s just no need. They could go on YouTube and see Game of Thrones and they would see more than they would ever see in the bath.&#8221; Even the actresses&#8217; parents can&#8217;t understand what all the fuss is about. Emilia Clarke adds: &#8220;When they saw the bath scene they were just like, &#8216;What&#8217;s all the fuss about?&#8217; It&#8217;s not a big deal, they&#8217;ve seen it all before&#8230; My mum sees it and is very cool and fine with it and my dad just kind of avoids eye contact for a couple of hours after he&#8217;s seen it, and then it&#8217;s fine.&#8221; Posted in Celebrity Gossip , Celebrity News , Celebrity Photos , Theatre | Leave a comment Rihanna Got a Tattoo of a Gun After Chris Brown Assault Posted on March 13, 2013 by admin After Chris Brown assaulted her in 2009, Rihanna had a gun tattooed on her arm to remind her to stay strong during the resulting media furor. A month following the now infamous assault, Rihanna got her firearm tattoo and she&#8217;s now revealed the personal meaning behind it. She tells British Elle magazine, &#8220;Everybody wanted to know what was happening in my life (at the time). Is she a drug addict? No. Is she an alcoholic? No. Is she a victim? No. That&#8217;s when I got the gun. It was a symbol of strength &#8211; it was &#8216;I&#8217;ll never be a victim!&#8217; I had all these eyes on me, critic after critic after critic. I&#8217;d heard so many things I was kind of numb to it.&#8221; I wonder if the gun still means the same things to Rihanna now that she&#8217;s back with Chris Brown&#8230; Posted in Celbrity Couples , Celebrity Gossip , Celebrity News , Celebrity Photos , Rihanna | Leave a comment Tina Fey Used Fast Food as Motivation for Sex Scenes Posted on March 13, 2013 by admin  Tina Fey has an interesting way to motivate herself for movie sex scenes: promising herself and her crew fast food for getting through them! In the upcoming film Admission , Fey plays a college admissions officer whose love interest is played by This is 40 star Paul Rudd . The two had to shoot a love scene and Fey came up with a very Liz Lemon-esque way to get herself through it. Tina Fey tells People magazine, &#8220;It was a terrifying nightmare. To clarify how much I like this stuff: I had a long-standing agreement with my hair and makeup people that when we shot the last romantic scene, we&#8217;d get McDonald&#8217;s. That&#8217;s what kept me going. Tina Fey  continues  &#8220;My goal was to get through the scenes without apologising, like, &#8216;It&#8217;s all going to be fine, and then I&#8217;ll get a double fish filet. Then I got one and immediately regretted it.&#8221; Yeah, that&#8217;s what happens when you eat McDonald&#8217;s, it always seems liek a good idea and it ends very badly.

Trent Reznor has announced that Nine Inch Nails will be reuniting to tour this year!! See the announcement below: NOTE FROM TRENT: Nine Inch Nails are touring this year. I was working with Adrian Belew on some musical ideas, which led to some discussion on performing, which led to some beard-scratching, which (many steps later) led to the decision to re-think the idea of what Nine Inch Nails could be, and the idea of playing a show. Calls were made to some friends, lots of new ideas were discussed, and a show was booked – which led to another, which somehow led to a lot of shows. The band is reinventing itself from scratch and will be comprised of Eric Avery, Adrian Belew, Alessandro Cortini, Josh Eustis, Ilan Rubin, and me. The first shows will begin this summer, followed by a full-on arena tour of the US this fall, and lots of other dates worldwide to follow through 2014. Lots of details and dates to come. See you soon. TR This is such great news! I&#8217;ve been a Nine Inch Nails fan for years and now I&#8217;ll have the chance to see them live!
