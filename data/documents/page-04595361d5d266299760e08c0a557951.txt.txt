Automotive Smut Road Thursday, January 3rd, 2013 Jaguar is all set to launch its new F-type into the world, and it&#8217;s every inch the modern sports car. But Jag is keen to stress that it&#8217;s been building exciting sports cars for a while. A really long while. So it took the F-type to the UK&#8217;s oldest motor racing circuit &#8211; Goodwood &#8211; and let it loose with some of the other classics in the Jaguar Heritage Fleet. Even pouring rain couldn&#8217;t dampen the enthusiasm of those present lucky enough to drive a C-type, D-type and lightweight E-type. Jealous? Yes. Yes we are. @Jaguarcarsmena &#171; Dubai Driven.
