 rt and music were critical
        aspects of medieval religious life and, towards the end
        of the Middle Ages, secular life as well. Singing without
        instrumental accompaniment was an essential part of
        church services. Monks and priests chanted the divine
        offices and the mass daily.

Some churches had instruments such as
        organs and bells. The organistrum or symphony (later
        known as a hurdy gurdy) was also found in churches. Two
        people were required to play this stringed
        instrument--one to turn the crank and the other to play
        the keys. 
 Medieval drama grew out of the liturgy, beginning in
        about the eleventh century. Some of the   topics were from the Old Testament
        (Noah and the flood, Jonah and the whale, Daniel in the
        lion's den) and others were stories about the birth and
        death of Christ. These dramas were performed with
        costumes and musical instruments and at first took place
        directly outside the church. Later they were staged in
        marketplaces, where they were produced by local guilds.
