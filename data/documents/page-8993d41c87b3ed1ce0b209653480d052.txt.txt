Original top colors offered  were white and black. It came with a plastic rear window that folded  down into the rear boot, and was hidden by a tonneau cover that snapped  into place. Manual tops were standard, or you could order a power top.  The power top was engaged by a small electric toggle switch on the right  side, underneath the dash. The switch powered a a small electric motor  that turned the input shaft to a hydraulic pump located in the trunk,  just below the rear boot. Two hydraulic cylinders raised the top up  and down. Finally when the top was up you latched it into place by means  of two &quot;J&quot; hooks located on the left and right side of of  the chrome weather-strip pillar on topof the windshield.
