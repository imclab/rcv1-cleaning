But, what many peopledon't know is that the Aloha Islands have a history rich in the art of storytelling, which hashelped to shape the literary developments that are so prominent in current culture of theislands. Power of Words To the Polynesians who first inhabited the Hawaiian islands, knowledge was a sacred spiritualpower, or a manifestation of mana , that had to be protected from all but those who wereconsidered worthy to use it. For this reason, the Polynesians didn't develop a written language forfear that the power of knowledge would spread uncontrollably to the common people, who would misuseit. In the past, Hawaiians believed that words held a spiritual power all their own, which transmitknowledge. The kahuna pule , or high priests, would pray for spiritualguidance, which would only be granted if the words were delivered perfectly. The Hawaiians believedthat as long as words were only spoken, then their powers could be limited to a chosen few. But, ifwords were written their mana would be available to anyone. The Hawaiians changed their beliefs about literacy with arrival of Western culture on theislands. Soon, the Hawaiian chiefs discovered that being able to read would help them to betterunderstand the power of the foreign culture that was arriving on their islands. The Christianmissionaries who arrived in Hawaii in 1820 established schools throughout the islands which thenative islanders were required to attend. By 1828, around 37,000 islanders had learned how to read,and education and learning had become celebrated throughout the islands, with graduation being atime of great festivity. With two-fifths of the population educated by 1834, it was believed thatHawaii had the highest literacy rate in the world at that time period. Famous Hawaiian Authors With the rise of literacy throughout the Hawaiian Islands, many authors with roots in theislands have emerged into the literary world. Here are some of Hawaii's most popular authors, allof whom have made invaluable contributions to Hawaiian literature: Kiana Davenport - born in Honolulu, HA; wrote novels thatexplored aspects of life as a Polynesian in Western society Tara Bray Smith - was born in Hawaii; wrote several articleabout the islands Lois-Ann Yamanaka - a Japanese American poet born inMolokai, HA; wrote literary works concerning Asian-American families and the local culture ofHawaii Oration Because words contained so much power in the Hawaiian culture, oration was an important part ofthe islands' literary history. Before the Hawaiians made use of the written word, the islandersused oratory performances to recount the historical events, as well as to relay stories and poems.Storytelling, or kukahekahe , and oratory, ha'i'okeki, were performed for entertainment, as well asreligious ceremonies, to relay family history, to praise chiefs and rulers. Hawaiian chiefs wouldhold formal meetings, during which orators would come and perform courtly addresses, giving praiseto the chief. This often took place before the giving of gifts, which along with the oration ofhigh praise, could be a way for the gift giver to apologize. Entertainment was also a reason to give elaborate orations. The skilled orators and poets wouldperform for the communities, speaking of heroic feats of the past. The skill of an storyteller wasmarked by his ability to precisely relay the story without omitting any detail, and the audiencescould be very critical. Master orators were able to speak for hours at a time, adding dramaticcreativity to their word-perfect performances. The extent of the memorization and recitation may be inconceivable to some, especially storieslike those of the legendary Kamapua'a, which required sixteen hours of exact recital. After theChristian missionaries began exposing the people to religion and literacy, they were awed by someof the Hawaiians who could recite whole books of the Bible shortly after learning how to read. Because much of Hawaiian history and literature relied on the memorized spoken word of the kahuna , who acted as living libraries, much of Hawaiianhistory has been lost. But, with the introduction of literature to the islands, the mana of wordshas increased beyond what the early Polynesians could have imagined, creating an eternal link toHawaii's rich and fascinating history.
