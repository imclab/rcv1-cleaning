Description Have you ever had a boss who spent more time cracking jokes than providing leadership? Or maybe a first-time acquaintance who failed to impress you with her knowledge because she tried too hard to be funny? Or how about a leader who stepped across the line with humor that insulted you or a colleague? If you want to avoid any of these situations in your leadership roles, then you need to listen to Humor В– Credibility = Doofus by internationally known leadership and project management expert Lonnie Pacelli. Lonnie provides insightful leadership tips on how to use just the right amount and type of humor to boost your credibility with team members, customers, and business partners. Get some helpful tips on how to appropriately use humor to: 1. Gain the trust of others 2. Increase your credibility 3. Enhance relationships 4. Be seen as down to earth 5. Avoid being viewed as a stick-in-the-mud. Coming across like Jay Leno or David Letterman might be good if youВ’re just trying to get a laugh; but if you need to get others to believe in you, playing a stand-up comic role without first establishing credibility wonВ’t cut the mustard with your team, customers or colleagues. Listen to LonnieВ’s practical, no-nonsense take-aways to help you establish credibility as a leader and avoid being branded a first-class doofus.
