Research more new SUVs in the Cars.com SUV/Crossover Buying Guide . 9:34 AM CDT, May 8, 2012 Outlander Sport among Mitsubishi's best Lacking the advertising budget and massive dealer network of much of its competition, Mitsubishi products are easily overlooked. For several of them, that's a shame. Case in point: The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport, a compact SUV that does everything well. 5:20 PM CDT, May 2, 2012 Review: Infiniti JX offers comfort even in the third row Jerry Seinfeld once said, "There's no such thing as fun for the whole family." Ask anyone who has tried cramming himself or his kin into the third row of seats in a crossover sport utility vehicle, and it's likely they'll agree. 6:50 PM CDT, April 21, 2012 Cars.com Expert Reviews 2012 Volvo XC60 I had high hopes for the 2012 Volvo XC60. I recently (reluctantly) ended a long-term relationship with my own beloved Volvo, a C30, because it no longer fit my evolving family. Having recently added a husband and stepdaughter to my previous status as a single mom of two, we're now in the market for a five-seater like the XC60. I hoped that maybe this car would fill my empty heart. 6:50 PM CDT, April 13, 2012 Cars.com Expert Reviews 2012 Audi Q5 I'm a fan of premium compact crossovers &mdash; compelling, small packages in which carlike agility, luxury and cargo versatility unite. The five-seat Audi Q5 blends these attributes well, and its sleek profile and attractive LED head- and taillights make the cute-ute look both elegant and sporty. April 5, 2012 Car review: Mazda builds fun, efficiency into CX-5 compact SUV If there's an ideal vehicle for every buyer, consider matching Mazda's 2013 CX-5 with Zeus or better yet, his kids' baby sitter. 6:50 PM CDT, March 14, 2012 Cars.com Expert Reviews 2012 Land Rover LR4 If the idea of luxury in an off-road vehicle puzzles, the Land Rover LR4 will confound. Mingling mud and premium leather is core to Land Rover's identity, and the five- or seven-seat LR4 aims to toe the line between off-road excellence and on-road luxury. It's got the hardware for the former, but how well does it master the latter? 3:18 PM CDT, March 13, 2012 Car review: 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport was introduced for the 2011 model year, and despite a harsh review on Cars.com, it's sold well. Though it shares the Outlander name, the Sport is smaller than the regular Outlander, which has been around since 2003. Car review: 2012 Mercedes-Benz M-Class With the 2012 M-Class, Mercedes brings the comfortable, luxurious driving experience of its flagship S-Class sedan to its most popular SUV. 5:50 PM CST, February 15, 2012 Kicking Tires Car review: 2012 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque February 18, 2012 With rough edges softened, Jeep Wrangler grows beyond niche As soon as my liver and spleen regain their former shapes, I will feel the need to tweet, little birds. Car review: 2012 Chevrolet Equinox After a complete overhaul in 2010, the Chevrolet Equinox only offers a couple of changes for 2012. The rear entertainment system is no longer available, but a collision alert and lane departure warning system is now available. 6:28 PM CST, December 21, 2011 Range Rover Evoque is cool and sophisticated If the parking lot were high school, the all-new Range Rover Evoque would throw the best parties, vacation in places we mispronounce and read magazines that are delivered to only the truest of sybarites. 6:15 PM CST, January 4, 2012 2012 Honda CR-V sports all-new looks inside and out If one of your New Year's resolutions was to be more honest and you just bought Honda's new 2012 CR-V, you may be up a creek without a spark plug. December 10, 2011 Cutting-edge Cadillac SRX gets new oomph Don't stand so close to the Caddy, kid. 1:46 PM CST, November 30, 2011 Car review: 2013 Mazda CX-5 Though some characteristics could be deal-breakers for certain buyers, the 2013 Mazda CX-5 is an exceptional SUV. November 15, 2011 All-new Evoque takes Range Rover in a new direction In 2007, Range Rover debuted a show vehicle called the LRX, which many of us appreciated, but then forgot: Range Rover, we then thought, doesn't build vehicles that look like that. 6:50 PM CDT, November 3, 2011 Toyota Highlander: Quiet, family-friendly SUV If you're looking for a three-row crossover, the 2011 Toyota Highlander is as sound a pick as you can get. It's affordable and it has a quiet, comfortable ride with a family-friendly interior. October 1, 2011 Redesigned 2012 Mazda5 brings 'mini' back to minivan With the redesigned 2012 Mazda5 minivan, the company answered a question I wasn't aware anyone was asking: "Why can't I get a minivan with a manual transmission?" August 11, 2011 Porsche goes green: 2011 Porsche Cayenne S Hybrid will appeal to environmentally conscious fans of the brand After reviewing the redesigned 2011 Porsche Cayenne, we've put the hybrid version, the Cayenne S Hybrid, to the test. So what's the verdict? 11:56 AM CDT, July 29, 2011 Steven Cole Smith: Jeep's entry-level Compass gets a new direction There's probably a good master's thesis to be written for someone's MBA on the Jeep marketing strategy &ndash; or lack of it. Obtaining the iconic brand, with a favorable worldwide reputation, was undeniably a central reason why Fiat bought into Chrysler. July 27, 2011 2011 Nissan Murano keeps good qualities and feels comfortable for families The 2011 Nissan Murano made me feel at home. I used to drive a 2006 Murano, and in the 2011, there were some changes, but I was also happy with what hadn't changed. There's not a whole lot to improve upon with the 2011 Murano because it fits families well. 10:08 AM CDT, June 7, 2011 Car review: 2011 Ford Flex To me, the Ford Flex is still the sharpest-looking minivan alternative on the market, but its boxy, ground-hugging appearance isn't for everyone -- and the low roofline sacrifices utility. 3:20 PM CDT, June 1, 2011 Car review: 2012 Audi A7 There are luxury cars with better performance or roomier backseats, and there are luxury SUVs with more utility, but the swoopy Audi A7 is a sexy hatchback with performance and personality to match. Car review: 2011 Nissan Rogue I've got nothing but respect for people who look forward to spending a Saturday testing out crossovers that cost more than 20 grand; the segment has more players than a baseball team, and most blend hopelessly together. Should you take on the challenge, somewhere between Starbucks and sundown you'll likely check out a Nissan Rogue. I suspect it will not rise above the crossover pack. 11:00 PM CDT, May 19, 2011 Steven Cole Smith: Jeep Wrangler Unlimited family-friendly but off-road ready I've long thought that if a car enthusiast fell into a coma, say, 60 years ago and just awoke, he or she might recognize only two vehicles: The Porsche 911, and the Jeep Wrangler. Sure, both those models have undergone extensive and dramatic updates, but they still retain the general appearance, and certainly serve the same audience, as they have for decades. Car review: 2011 Acura TSX Sport Wagon The TSX Sport Wagon makes me wonder why wagons aren't more popular than they are. It's easy to live with and offers more flexibility than a similar sedan would. It also offers rewarding, driver-oriented performance without sacrificing comfort. May 6, 2011 Steven Cole Smith: Airstream Avenue is a hotel room on wheels Airstream is known more for its travel trailers than its self-powered motorhomes, but the Ohio-based company has been in the motorhome business for decades. If you've driven past a motorhome sales lot lately, you have seen an abundance of inventory, as the downturn in the economy and the upturn in fuel prices have crippled the industry. April 28, 2011 BMW's X3 xDrive35i is an SUV that acts like a sports car Your life is about to change, and your sports car is terrified. Car review: 2011 Mercedes-Benz GL350 Let's face it: If you're smitten by Mercedes' GL-Class full-size SUV, the recent run-up in prices at the pump probably rates somewhere between insignificant and unimportant in your car search. With seating for seven, the GL-Class is a big SUV -- and it gulps fuel like one. Even the most efficient version, the GL350 Bluetec diesel we tested, manages just an EPA-estimated 17/21 mpg city/highway. Likely more important to you would be a comfortable ride with commanding views, space for the family and all their stuff, and a level of luxury to justify a $60,000-plus base price. Car review: 2011 Dodge Durango Numbers are inevitable when talking about cars. Whether it's dimensions, horsepower, wheel size or seat count, each category has a number attached to it -- and it's often used to trump a competitor. 10:49 AM CDT, April 1, 2011 Steven Cole Smith: 2012 Mazda5 puts the 'mini' back in minivan Somewhere between the introduction of the pioneering Chrysler minivan in 1984 and today, we lost the "mini" in minivan. The original base-model Dodge and Plymouth minivans were 175.9 inches long. Now, the best-selling minivan is the maxi-sized Honda Odyssey, which is 202.9 inches long, more than two feet longer. 5:57 PM CST, February 25, 2011 Test Drive: 2011 Porsche Cayenne Turbo review Porsche spices up Cayenne sport utility It is reassuring to know that at 130 miles per hour the new 2011 Porsche Cayenne Turbo will automatically lower itself a little more than an inch to better hug the road. You simply cannot be too careful. February 18, 2011 Cadillac CTS-V wagon:A ridiculous, wonderful move for conservative GM With vehicles like the new plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt and the 30-miles-per-gallon Buick Regal, General Motors Co. seems to be selling itself as the sensible-shoes car company, populating its lineup with plucky, practical cars that offend no one. 4:26 PM CST, February 10, 2011 Test Drive: 2011 Dodge Durango Crew AWD review Dodge Durango a grand sibling The 2011 Dodge Durango and its sibling the Jeep Grand Cherokee have a lot in common but there are also some significant differences that could easily make the Durango a more appealing choice. 4:22 PM CST, January 27, 2011 Test Drive: 2011 Lincoln MKX AWD Bells, whistles and bliss Lincoln is well on its way to sowing confusion with its vehicular alphabet soup of models consisting of the MKS, MKT, MKZ and MKX. January 9, 2011 Land Rover LR4 equally capable on the road or off When Land Rover redesigned the mid-level LR4 SUV for 2010, many of my colleagues proclaimed that it was a leaps-and-bounds improvement over the model it replaces, the LR3. 2:02 PM CST, January 3, 2011 Text Drive: 2011 Ford Explorer All-new Ford Explorer raises bar for SUVs Numbers don't lie: There's no denying that the Ford Explorer, introduced in 1990, was an enormous success, quickly becoming &#8212; year after year &#8212; the top-selling SUV. The four-door, V-6-powered sport utility vehicle filled an enormous hole in Ford's lineup, as the models that preceded it, the Bronco and smaller Bronco II, were never offered with rear doors. November 29, 2010 Test Drive: 2011 Nissan Juke review Nissan Juke feints at SUV, delivers like sports car Judging from its initial unfocused advertising campaign, Nissan doesn't seem to know exactly what to do with the 2011 Juke. And after a week testing it, I see the problem: It doesn't fit into conventional categories. 6:03 PM CST, November 12, 2010 Test Drive: 2011 Nissan Rogue SUV review Restyled Nissan Rogue a right-sized SUV Nissan was a little late to the compact crossover SUV party -- with only its truckish Xterra to battle car-based products like the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Mitsubishi Outlander and Ford Escape -- until the 2008 Nissan Rogue was introduced. The fact that the Rogue was based on the Sentra platform was not encouraging -- the Sentra was fine as an entry-level car, but how would it work as the basis for an SUV? October 25, 2010 Test Drive: 2011 Honda Odyssey 2011 Honda Odyssey: Better? Yes. Prettier? No. Good news for Chrysler: The company's minivans are no longer the ugliest in the new-car showroom, now that Honda has introduced the redesigned 2011 Odyssey. September 2, 2010 2011 Kia Sportage EX: Sharp-looking crossover has undeniable German influence Kia should check the security cameras at its offices. August 19, 2010 Infiniti QX56 is a luxurious powerhouse in a rotund shell The good, the bad and the ugly. It's cliche, it's trite &#8212; and it's exactly how to describe Infiniti's 2011 QX56. July 12, 2010 A lot to like about 2010 Cadillac CTS Sport Wagon Seldom -- OK, probably never -- have I had so much positive reaction to the styling of a station wagon as I did with the 2010 Cadillac CTS Sport Wagon. I like the looks of the CTS sedan and the new-for-2011 CTS coupe, but, for some reason, the basic styling template of the CTS seems to work best with the wagon. It is, in a word, a knockout. July 8, 2010 Lexus GX 460 offers a stylish ride on main roads or mud In 1923, famed British climber George Mallory was asked by a reporter why he wanted to climb the yet-to-be-conquered Mt. Everest. His answer went on to live in the pantheon of exploring quotations: "Because it's there." July 1, 2010 Test Drive: 2011 Mercedes-Benz E350 Wagon review Mercedes E350: Last large wagon standing It is not often one gets to drive a species that &#8212; at least in the U.S. &#8212; is endangered. But I am. It is a station wagon, a segment that is being virtually wiped out by sport-utility vehicles and crossover car-like SUVs. June 28, 2010 Test Drive: 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee review Grand Cherokee takes on Land Rover It's been a long time coming, but the redesigned 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee is finally here. It couldn't come soon enough for Chrysler, which is desperately in need of new products to give consumers a new reason to walk into its showrooms. June 29, 2010 Buick Enclave: Where luxury meets the minivan A lot of car shoppers link minivans with a terminal case of parental frumpiness, but when it comes to outright utility those vehicles have long beaten more socially acceptable crossovers, hands down. General Motors' three-row crossovers -- the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave -- narrow that divide. June 17, 2010 Test Drive: 2010 Honda Odyssey Touring Odyssey is still the way to move people and their things Just a few years ago, the automotive industry had serious doubts about the viability of the minivan. Several manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors, pulled out, hoping to woo customers who needed to carry a lot of people to car-based crossovers. June 3, 2010 Test Drive: 2010 Mitsubishi Outlander GT S-AWC review Outlander uses a lot of letters to spell OK With its 2010 Outlander GT S-AWC, Mitsubishi explores not only the limits of alphabetical nomenclature but also whether Americans care about a crossover with a complex all-wheel-drive system designed to provide extra cornering power and traction under virtually all conditions. 2:00 PM CDT, May 26, 2010 Test Drive: Sporty look gives Mazda CX-7 its edge There's a long, long list of very competent sport utility vehicles in the $25,000 range, and really not that much to differentiate them. 8:21 PM CDT, May 26, 2010 Car review: Subaru Outback crosses a magical divide Magic. The word itself is thrilling. It promises surprises (good ones). Mystery. And if you're lucky, a little humor. June 3, 2010 Test Drive: 2010 Volkswagen Touareg review Price the big drawback to Touareg Volkswagen joined the sport utility vehicle market a little late, waiting until the 2004 model year to jump in with Touareg, named for a nomadic tribe in the Sahara. May 27, 2010 In crowded midsize SUV pack, Mazda CX-7 is stylin' There's a long list of competent sport utility vehicles for around $25,000, and not that much differentiates them. April 29, 2010 2011 Toyota Sienna review: Family hauler gets a stylish overhaul Unless you've been living under a floor mat for the last six months, you know times have been tough for Toyota. 1:12 PM CDT, May 5, 2010 Test Drive: Super-quick Jeep will make you feel young again On paper, few vehicles make less sense than the 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8: Huge, thirsty engine; not that much room inside; and though it's four-wheel-drive, it's too low-slung for off-roading. While the big chrome-plated dual exhausts look great, they stick out right under the license plate, effectively eliminating a full-sized trailer hitch. April 28, 2010 2010 Land Rover LR4 luxury SUV can handle rock climbing and carpool The 2010 Land Rover LR4 has some characteristics that are definitely not from around here. While many full-size American-made SUVs tend to be wide, the LR4 feels tall, not unlike a lovely London row house. It's stately and civilized like a well-dressed London businessman, but it also has the functionality and flexibility of said businessman in a pair of wellies. April 29, 2010 2010 Honda Element unleashed: Wooing the dog set If the Dog Friendly badges don't tip you off, the thick rubber floor mats with a dog-bone pattern should: This 2010 Honda Element comes with a special option package that should appeal to dogs &#8212; and, presumably, their owners. January 28, 2010 Jim Mateja: Acura ZDX loaded with luxury Acura waved the magic wand and turned a sport ute into a sedan. April 8, 2010 Test Drive: 2010 Acura ZDX Bold look marks the small-inside Acura ZDX The 2010 Acura ZDX is the third model we've tested that combines crossover characteristics with those of a coupe. The ZDX enjoyed more fans than detractors. March 24, 2010 2010 Lincoln MKT review Mom finds interior just right in Lincoln MKT crossover Lincoln MKT is a three-row crossover that's based on Ford's Flex, which is a car that I love. The MKT has the same platform and interior layout as the Flex, with nicer interior materials and an entirely new exterior. March 10, 2010 2010 Subaru Outback: All wagons large and small A few things have changed with the 2010 Subaru Outback. It's undergone a redesign that's full of positive changes, but there's one change I'm not crazy about -- the exterior. It looks like it's been flattened out. The angles aren't as pronounced as they used to be. Even though my home state of Colorado is casual, where even on a fancy night out you can get by in denim, a little spice is nice. I like my cars to look confident. February 18, 2010 Test Drive: 2010 Madza5 Touring Jim Mateja: Addition of Mazda5 not a plus for lineup Mazda had a great idea &#8212; to create a smaller, higher-mileage, affordable vehicle called the Mazda5 with three rows of seats for those folks getting out of larger, lower-mileage and pricey SUVs. February 15, 2010 Suzuki SX4 earns its stripes It's a well-known principle of quantum mechanics that racing stripes make a car faster. Depending on the width and color of the stripes, accessorizing paint schemes can be good for as much as 2 seconds in the quarter-mile and 50 mph top speed. January 15, 2010 Test Drive: 2010 Toyota 4Runner Jim Mateja: 4Runner beast burdened by weight It's been 25 years since Toyota added a truck-based 4Runner sport utility to take on the domestics. February 11, 2010 Test Drive: 2010 Cadillac SRX Jim Mateja: Raft of upgrades paired with lower cost give Cadillac SRX a major boost Cadillac's chances of deposing the king of luxury crossovers is a lot better now that consumers, the media and even the government have taken to labeling Toyota as a villain, the role those same consumers, media and government bestowed on General Motors the last few years. January 3, 2010 Test Drive: 2010 Ford Transit Connect review Jim Mateja: Nothing fancy about 2010 Ford Transit Connect, but it does what it needs to Quiet? December 20, 2009 Test Drive: 2011 Kia Sorento EX AWD review Jim Mateja: Kia Sorento of the future coming soon Call it the United Nations of crossovers. December 13, 2009 Test Drive: 2010 GMC Terrain SLT-1 Jim Mateja: GMC Terrain mostly smooth, with a few rough spots The Chevy Equinox is selling as fast as the trucks arrive, and General Motors hopes its cousin GMC Terrain will have similar success. September 20, 2009 Test Drive: 2010 Lexus LX570 Jim Mateja: Lexus LX570 has it all, for a price It can pilot the family on the open road or climb a hill and ford a stream, while cooling a couple cans of pop and a sub sandwich for either. August 23, 2009 Test Drive: 2009 Nissan Cube S Jim Mateja: Nissan Cube aims at young buyers from right angle Move over, Aztek. You've lost the ugly crown to the Cube. July 19, 2009 Test Drive: 2010 Chevrolet Equinox LTZ Jim Mateja: Chevy Equinox offers balance of luxury, mileage The midsize TrailBlazer had to go. And take its 12 to 14 m.p.g. city and 16 to 20 highway mileage, depending on the model, with it. March 1, 2009 Jim Mateja: Suzuki packs a lot in little SX4 crossover Suzuki is a bit player on the auto industry stage. June 14, 2009 Test Drive: 2009 Dodge Grand Caravan SXT Jim Mateja: Grand Caravan remains a minivan for the ages I will never forget the look on Lee Iacocca's face when the Chrysler chairman strolled into McCormick Place for the 1984 Chicago Auto Show, spotted the truck-like rear-wheel-drive Chevy Astro and Ford Aerostar rivals to his car-like front-wheel-drive Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager and broke a broad smile that lifted his glasses off his nose. June 7, 2009 Test Drive: 2010 Lexus RX350 AWD Jim Mateja: Lexus still has RX for crossovers The funny-looking Toyota concept Sport Luxury Vehicle bowed at the 1997 Chicago Auto Show as an alternative to the station wagon and minivan. May 3, 2009 Test Drive: 2009 Dodge Sprinter 2500 Jim Mateja: Sprinter fashioned for extended uses To some, like the politically correct police, an eight-passenger Chevy Suburban or Ford Expedition SUV is too big. April 19, 2009 Test Drive: 2010 Kia Soul Jim Mateja: Kia baring its Soul before youthful carbuyers When piloting the 2010 Chevy Camaro sport coupe through the Detroit 'burbs, jaws dropped, eyes popped and one loyalist was so moved he broke into a gallop to try to catch up with it for a closer look. March 15, 2009 Test Drive: 2009 BMW 535i xDrive wagon Jim Mateja: BMW wagon's power, perks come at a price Most automakers turned to SUVs and crossovers to carry a load of people and their possessions because most people want a machine far more stylish than a station wagon. 11:07 AM CDT, April 30, 2010 Test Drive: 2010 Honda Element: Quirky SUV even Fido could love If the "Dog Friendly" badges don't tip you off, the thick rubber floor mats with a dog bone pattern should: This 2010 Honda Element is equipped with a special optional package that should appeal to dogs &#8212; and, presumably, their owners. February 15, 2009 Test Drive: 2009 Jeep Patriot Jim Mateja: Make room for Patriot&#8212;by fiat General Motors and Chrysler failed to march to the altar, so Chrysler is now holding hands with Fiat. February 8, 2009 Jim Mateja: Neither mud nor gravel nor snow will stop LR2 Before turning to Washington, Ford turned to India for help. February 1, 2009 Test Drive: 2009 Jeep Wrangler 4-door Unlimited Sahara 4x4 Jim Mateja: Roughneck Wrangler opens 2 more doors to adventure If there was any doubt a four-door Jeep Wrangler makes sense, you need only look at the numbers. January 25, 2009 Test Drive: 2009 Suzuki Equator, Grand Vitara Jim Mateja: Vanilla Equator stands out in name only The obvious question is why Suzuki added a midsize pickup for 2009 when trucks are losing favor. January 18, 2009 Jim Mateja: Arguments for H3T piling up It wasn't until the snow topped 14 inches that Ma Nature took a nap and let mortals undo the damage. January 4, 2009 Test Drive: 2009 Toyota Venza Jim Mateja: Toyota says sedan; we say Lexus light If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it still could be a pheasant, maybe a lion, if you adhere to the gospel of Toyota. December 21, 2008 Test Drive: 2009 Nissan Murano Jim Mateja: Distinctive Murano now incredible bulk If events of the last several months have taught automakers anything, one should be that big no longer is better. November 9, 2008 Test Drive: 2009 Ford Escape Hybrid Jim Mateja: Zippy, thrifty Escape hybrid is truly politically correct Why would President-elect Barack Obama trade in his sporty and luxurious, Hemi-powered Chrysler 300C on a 4-cylinder and battery Ford Escape hybrid compact SUV? August 17, 2008 Test Drive: 2009 Honda Pilot Jim Mateja: Unyielding Pilot running on all 3, 4, 6 cylinders W hen a vehicle controls the number of cylinders in use based on its need for more or less power, you'd think the automaker would shout it from the highest mountain&#8212;especially with gas prices rising like CEO salaries. August 10, 2008 Test Drive: 2009 Chrysler Aspen / Dodge Durango Hybrid Jim Mateja: At long last, a hybrid from Chrysler Better late than never? July 27, 2008 Test Drive: 2009 Ford Flex Jim Mateja: Love/hate Flex hides many charms D &#233;j&#224; vu all over again. September 14, 2008 Test Drive: 2009 Chevrolet Traverse Jim Mateja: GM traverses crossover gap at Chevy G as at $2 a gallon is gone forever, and with it the best years for mid- and full-size SUVs. July 20, 2008 Test Drive: 2009 Volkswagen Tiguan Jim Mateja: What do you get when you cross tiger, iguana? Don't ever let Volkswagen name one of your kids. March 2, 2008 Test Drive: 2009 Dodge Journey Jim Mateja: A curious, but satisfying, Journey Journey is the first midsize crossover in the Dodge family. Its recent arrival in showrooms is driven largely by estimates that sales of the car-based sport-utilities are expected to top 1.2 million by the end of 2009. November 16, 2008 Test Drive: 2009 Kia Borrego Jim Mateja: Kia goes truckin' with V-8 Borrego Another in the growing list of nameplates offering three rows of seats to hold Dad and Mom, their kids plus someone else's. November 29, 2009 Test Drive: 2010 Cadillac CTS Premium Sport Wagon AWD Jim Mateja: Wagon ho! Cadillac going off on new trail with CTS Sport Wagon The midsize CTS helped ignite the rebirth of Cadillac, with its dynamic design and good appointments.
