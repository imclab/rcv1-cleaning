Once the doyen of world brands for reliability it has been hounded bynegatives news and even had itâs credit rating cut this year. Though vehiclesales rose over 24 percent analysts expected better sales. Toyota has respondedto its credibility crisis extending record company incentives to try and winback buyers.

Great review! billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Habee they do look pretty snazzy, not just an ol' truck anymore - by far the biggest selling vehicle in the U.S. prasetio30 3 years ago from malang-indonesia Level 7 Commenter Nice information. This is great hub and I really enjoy all the words from you. I liked the pictures also. Those are great cars. Thumbs up for you! msorensson 3 years ago Great info, Billy :-) billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Thank you prasetio for your comments and glad you liked the cars and truck photos. billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Thanks Melinda - the F-150 is popular in Texas and Louisiana :) Micky Dee 3 years ago Level 2 Commenter I have a Ford pick-up. The Ranger has minor problems that irritate me but they're durable for the most part. Thanks Billy! billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Yes I think they are the best part of Ford, we have an explorer and while it has lasted it has had a few electrical problems. britneydavidson 3 years ago from united kingdom i really like Toyota Corolla nice info. billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Corollas are handy cars Britney CYBERSUPE 3 years ago from MALVERN, PENNSYLVANIA, U.S.A. I am a Toyota Man. Good work ! Good Luck billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Cybersupe they will be back once they sort all their current problems IMO Sandyspider 3 years ago from Wisconsin, USA Level 1 Commenter nice work. We have two vehicles that are Ford right now. I would definitely buy another one. Nellieanna 3 years ago from TEXAS Level 8 Commenter I grew up in a family dedicated to Fords - from Model Ts (including trucks and drilling rigs) to all kinds of trucks & family cars. Since I've driven myself, I've driven other brands but for the past 25 or so years - just Fords, including trucks and SUVs. It's heartening to know the old Ford Co. is still up and running in the top ranks. Surely doesn't appear that the idea of going smaller has taken over completely, either. Good article, billy. Ign Andy 3 years ago from Green Home Office I still a fan of Japanese cars especially Toyota and Honda. CRV is my favorite. Great hub Billy! billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Sandy good to see we just have the one though :) I made a decision after GM got bailed out I would buy Ford if I buy American cars ai Was so disgusted - if I wanted a GM I would of bought one - now I am subsidizing because of the Obama bailout - damn how did this turn political lol I was impressed that Ford never went cap and hand or private jet to beg for out cash. billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Nellieanna it is heartening that Ford is still ploughing along and they have made some poor decisions but they have survived so far on their own. You have had a great Ford experience - no Mustang there in your younger days? billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Ign thanks for sharing - Hondas are so reliable and sadly we used to be able to say that about Toyota - lets hope they can come back stronger than ever. AEvans 3 years ago from SomeWhere Out There Level 1 Commenter I didn't know the Ford F-150 was the number one seller in the U.S. my husband loves Ford but I am a big BMW fan, I know we are opposites but that is what makes the World go round. Great read! :) billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Thanks AE - sounds like our place we have a Ford and an Audi. Dave Mathews 3 years ago from NORTH YORK,ONTARIO,CANADA Interesting! I've been trying to find out more on these new electric/gas rpotptypes. If believable the milage is fantastic, but how do prices compare, and since new how economical with they be for repairs? Dave. billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Dave what I have seen with hybrids is they are still expensive relative to straight gas and you need significantly higher gas prices to bring your money back. However they are getting more and more efficient all the time. Auto parts for these are expensive from what a friend who has one keeps whining about that issue tells me susanlang 3 years ago Hi Billy. The Ford is all american and top rated class for a long time. I know of some of the Ford family from up-state NY. I like this hub and the photo's are great. billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Thanks Susan - which Ford do they drive I wonder? Lady_E 3 years ago from London, UK Level 5 Commenter Thanks Billy - interesting info. I honestly didn't know they drove Fords in America. Thought it was a British Car. Glad I read your Hub. :) billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Hi Lady E no Henry Ford was about as American as you can get :) Henry Ford was born July 30, 1863. He grew up on a farm in what is now part of Dearborn, Michigan. He was the first born for William and Mary Ford, they had six children. mulberry1 3 years ago I want a new car this year. I just want small, fuel efficient and affordable right now. (so the trucks and SUVs are definitely out). I can't decide if I want a 2009 and find a decent rebate or go for a 2010. Thinking, thinking,...Maybe a Ford Focus (I've never owned a Ford!) billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Those rebates are always good or even a shop sample. We have one Ford - an explorer it has had a few electrical problems but for the most part we are happy with it. I have a soft sport for Ford now they are the only ones that didn't ask for a handout from the US Government - i.e. the U.S. taxpayer. mulberry1 3 years ago I'm hoping for some incentives/rebates and such. Holding out until I find the right thing. Good info. billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Mulberry in this economy it is definitely a buyers market - hold off as long as you find what you want I think. Peggy W 3 years ago from Houston, Texas Level 8 Commenter Interesting hub about the best selling cars in America. We have always held on to ours for a long time. billyaustindillon 3 years ago Hub Author Peggy yes you see plenty F-150's in Houston. We have had our cars forever also - one of the great wastes of money is driving a new car out of a showroom and seeing the price collapse. I try to minimize that experience :) stars439 2 years ago from Louisiana, The Magnolia and Pelican State. Level 6 Commenter Great hub. Beautiful car photographs . Good thing to have for a car is a shed. God Bless You. billyaustindillon 2 years ago Hub Author Stars indeed you need to keep your best selling car in America in a big shed :) HuuLeon 2 years ago from Virginia I always have a question in my head. How come Honda Accord is more expensive than a Toyota Camry when Toyota last longer than Honda. billyaustindillon 2 years ago Hub Author HuuLeon Honda does better because of branding and where they are built plus the Toyota production facilities allow for cheaper production costs. Toyota has also taken a dint over the last few years with huge recalls. Leon 2 years ago I see now. Yeah every year there's some sort of recall for Toyota. Beside Toyota and Honda what else would you prefer to buy Bill? billyaustindillon 2 years ago Hub Author In the Camry space I would go the Audi route - pricier but will last far longer and a smoother ride and look Peggy W 2 years ago from Houston, Texas Level 8 Commenter As to purchasing new cars and watching the price collapse when leaving the showroom lot...the smart way is to purchase program cars. Less mileage; generally well cared for company cars; generally 1 or 2 years old; full warranties and much less money than purchasing new cars. I learned that from my mother who purchased one years ago. I am still driving that car today and would think about purchasing a program car in the future. Most dealerships offer them. billyaustindillon 2 years ago Hub Author Financially buying a new car can be one of the worst decisions you can make because of the price drop off as you point out. Only positive would be the warranty. So many deals to be had in this economy on near new used also. drpastorcarlotta 2 years ago from BREAKOUT MINISTRIES, INC.
