The ReclineSure Leveling System offers nine recline positions to accommodate a wide variety of vehicles, and the built-in belt lockoffs allow installation with a vehicle belt. Achieving a tight, secure vehicle fit is made easy with the SuperCinch LATCH tightener's force-multiplying technology. The two RideRight bubble levels accurately indicate the correct seat angle in both the rear-facing and forward-facing modes to eliminate guesswork, and when it&#8217;s time to switch to forward facing, an integrated slide path allows you to reposition the LATCH strap without rethreading. When not in use, the LATCH connectors stow in the integrated LATCH storage compartments. A removable insert accommodates smaller babies, while the five-point harness with a two-position chest clip helps keep your little travelling companion safe and the six-position headrest features an integrated harness adjustment to help keep your child comfortable. A removable cupholder can be used on either side of the seat to help keep a beverage handy, and cleanup is easy with the removable, machine-washable seat pad. For use with children from 5 to 40 lbs. in rear-facing mode and from 22 to 65 lbs. in forward-facing mode. Some images below may depict an alternate pattern. Actual product is Mystique.

By Whitney from Virginia About Me Parent of Multiples (Twins etc) See all my reviews Pros Comfortable Easy to Adjust Easy to Clean Easy to install Safe Sturdy Stylish Cons Heavy Best Uses Infants Newborn Toddlers Comments about Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat - Mystique : This is a great car seat! This was one thing I was going to research for months, the best car seat out there. The car seat is one of the most important items you purchase for a baby and although all of the car seats on the market have passed crash test ratings, there are several things to look for. We were debating between this car seat and a Britax, since they get great reviews. The one thing about Britax car seats is that they are way too over rated. I showed them to my husband with the intention on buying it and he laughed. He seriously thought I was joking. The quality isn't very good and the padding is horrible! The Chicco Nextfit was right next to it, so we had a great comparison. First off the padding and comfort level is far superior to any other. It is easy to clean and the head support allows my daughter to sit in it without her head tilting to the side. There is also great head protection. The head protection on others wasn't very good. We use to in several recline positions, so it is wonderful and she can see out the sides without any problem. The latch system is perfect and we installed the car seat in 3 minutes, no lie. I keep it in my car so it may be heavy to transfer, but it should be! It's a car seat protecting your child. It is made of steel, rather than cheap plastic like a lot of other car seats. It was a tough decision, but I'm glad I spent the time doing the research. You should really do a side by side comparison because you will be blown away by the Chicco Nextfit. It is very sturdy and soooo comfortable! We were sold from the second we tried it out! Our daughter will be able to be I the reclined position for years to come because of the recline feature and that makes me very happy! Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend ( 3 of 3 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also report this review as inappropriate. Comment on this review 6/1/2013 ( 1 of 1 customers found this review helpful) 5.0 Winning!!! By Mama Mia from CA About Me Parent of Two or More Children Pros Comfortable Easy to Adjust Safe Sturdy Cons Heavy Best Uses Infants Newborn Toddlers Comments about Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat - Mystique : We loved this seat so much we bought a second one. If fits both our SUV and 4 door sedan great! My 9 monther is comfortable and enjoys being able to look out the window in an upright position, but then also sleep comfortably in a recline. It is on the heavy side, but for us that makes it all the more dependable, emphasizing the quality. I would recommend it! Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend ( 1 of 1 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also report this review as inappropriate. Comment on this review 5/6/2013 ( 4 of 15 customers found this review helpful) 1.0 Just Horrible Rear-Facing By Lady Grey from Oneonta, NY About Me First Time Parent Pros Cons Bulky Difficult To Adjust Difficult to Set Up Hard to Install Heavy Uncomfortable Best Uses Toddlers Comments about Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat - Mystique : We purchased this car seat because we really like Chicco products and the KeyFit seat and stroller have been really good, but I was super dissapointed when we tried to install this seat in our Volvo wagain. First, if you don't have the latch system in your car, DON'T buy this seat. If you intend on using this seat rear-facing, DON'T; all the great things they boast about adjusting and such, forget about it rear facing. Installing this seat with the shoulder belt causes the seat to be so crammed up against the car that you cannot access the buttom to recline the seat (useless if you need to adjust it to make sure it is correctly levelled after it gets buckled in.) On that note, once you managed to get your kid in the seat the straps always get twisted around and once they are buckled you can't even get any leverage to tighten them because the strap is so close to the car seat. All of this is AFTER you struggle to get the shoulder belt through the seat to get it in the car in the first place. Not easy and certainly doesn't &quot;Fit Any Vehicle&quot;. I'm sure the features are better for front-facing, but there is no point in buying an expensive convertable seat if you don't use it to it's full potential. My daughter refused to fall asleep in it...even after a day of running around at the park and no nap. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend ( 4 of 15 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also report this review as inappropriate. Comment on this review 3/23/2013 ( 5 of 7 customers found this review helpful) 5.0 Best Convertible car seat out there. By Bebe from New York About Me First Time Parent Pros Comfortable Easy to Adjust Easy to Clean Easy to install Lightweight Safe Sturdy Stylish Cons Pricey But Worth It Best Uses Infants Newborn Preemies Toddlers Comments about Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat - Mystique : I bought this three weeks ago at babies r us on central ave Yonkers NY with my husband. We were surprise to see it in the store because the website said it preorder. Was glad to find it because my 1 year old outgrow her Greco car seat since it wasn't a convertible one. We tested out a couple of brands and this was by far the most comfortable one. It has so much cushion it feels like you sitting on clouds. It is stylish and easy to install , it only took us 5 mins to install it at the parking lot of babies R Us. Lol. My daughter is so comfortable in it she don't cry at the back seat anymore she just go to sleep right away when we get in the car. Is comfortable, not heavy, safe, stylish and easy to adjust to find a proper position for your child. Very good investment we made. Only wish it holds your child till 100 pounds like some convertible car seats but this only takes up to 65 pounds. Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend ( 5 of 7 customers found this review helpful) Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also report this review as inappropriate.
