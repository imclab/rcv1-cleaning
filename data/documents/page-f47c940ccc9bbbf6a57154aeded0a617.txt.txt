Oil changes, new tires and topping off fluids are some of the most basic &ndash; and most prevalent. However, not many think of their Honda auto glass as an expendable part. Indeed, even windshields have a certain life span &ndash; especially if yours is already cracked. If so, then you may have trouble not only with reselling your car, but also with the basics like passing a state inspection! If you're in the process of shopping for a qualified auto glass care center that can provide you with an instant windshield repair quote for your Honda then you may notice that prices can vary drastically. For example, a shop called &ldquo;California Glass&rdquo; in San Francisco can replace the front windshield on the 2010 Honda Pilot model for around $250, while Speedy Glass in the same city will cost you almost $400. This begs the question: why is there such a difference in price? First, be aware that different shops pay their employees different wages. This is not accidental &ndash; skilled workers are properly trained, and because they probably paid for their certification out of their own pocket, they're more likely to work at a professional center. In this regard, the price you're paying translates into things like service warranties and general lack of problems that may arise from a cheap repair job air leaks, water leaks, damage to the car a company not using primer. Second, not all parts are made equal. You may think that all auto glass manufacturers have to adhere to a certain standard, but nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, a lot of foreign auto glass is actually imported into the United States to be sold for less. As a consumer, it is your responsibility to ensure that your auto glass is compliant with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. When you call for an appointment, ask the auto windshield quote provider about FMVSS. Pay attention: if they know what they're talking about, they'll be able to provide an insightful answer. Third, the price of the windshield replacement quote for Honda auto glass may be determined by the convenience that the car care shop provides. What's their turnaround time? Do they allow financing? Can they do the job the same day? Some auto glass repair operations even have mobile units that will dispatch a trained technician on-site &ndash; to your home, to your office, or even to the scene of an accident where you broke your windshield &ndash; and do an emergency replacement on the spot. It should come as no surprise that this convenience comes at a steeper price. Last but not least: if you're tight on cash, get a quote for both a windshield repair AND a full replacement for your vehicle. Emergency Glass Repair provides both. A window crack may look like you need brand new windshield installed, but perhaps you can do with chip repair at less than half the price. A job like this can be done for under $100, and shouldn't take longer than 45-60 minutes to perform! When time comes to finalize your pick the company that stands out to you the most.
