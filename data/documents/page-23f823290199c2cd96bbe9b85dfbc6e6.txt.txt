He explained that he was indeed upset about a theft of some personal belongings, telling Seacrest, &#8220;People steal from me all the time. Stuff did happen,Ã‚Â it wasn&#8217;t a watch it was something else.&#8221; But with regard to the police being called based on reports of an &#8220; alleged suicide attempt &#8220;, he said &#8220;IÃ‚Â don&#8217;t know what happened to be honest with you, I don&#8217;t know what people are talking about. . .only thing I did was take a drive to see how my head is.&#8221; Even though Timbaland&#8217;s own wife and mother-in-law were the ones who called the police, the producer has no idea why they Ã‚Â reacted that way and said that when the police finally located his car, he didn&#8217;t realize what was going on. &#8220;The officer pulled me over, he just had to do procedures,&#8221; Timbaland explained. Ã‚Â &#8221;I snapped, &#8216;Who the heck reported something like that? No, why would I commit suicide?&#8217;&#8221; He was released by the cops after it was determined that he didn&#8217;t pose a threat to himself or others. You can listen to the entire broadcast of Seacrest&#8217;s show with Timbaland here . We&#8217;re glad the incident is cleared up and that everyone is safe and sound.
