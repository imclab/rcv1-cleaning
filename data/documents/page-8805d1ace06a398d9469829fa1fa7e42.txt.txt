NOTICE: You may have seen recent news reports about how some unscrupulous companies salvage vehicles and junk car parts into areas where people can be seriously harmed by toxic components, mercury, lead and dangerous chemicals that are found in all cars. These cash for car operations, (evens some charities) are not disposing of vehicles correctly and this is bad for both all living things and the environment. AutoRev is a leader in environmentally responsible salvage vehicle disposal and it&#8217;s important to know that when you choose to sell your vehicle. You&#8217;re working with a company that always handles every facet of the recovery and disposal process with utmost dedication and care for our world and our children&#8217;s future.
