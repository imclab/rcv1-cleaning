In layman terms - futuristic photo art. Think: panoramic photos w/ Google Earth's capabilities. Still KONGFUSED? You can keep clicking and zooming and clicking and zooming, seemingly endlessly, until you find yourself on a dramatic balcony, looking up a statue&#8217;s nose &#8212; the more you zoom-in, the more clear &amp; real the distant images becomes. Fascinating pieces of works from that may revolutionize the photography art world. -ENTER- HYPERPHOTOS EXPERIENCE by JF RAUZIER Galerie des Affaires étrangères "Hyperphotos might look like a single photo, but these self dubbed hyperphotos are made of hundreds and sometimes thousands of individual photos. You can dive into each one and find an incredible amount of detail. Rauzier spends countless hours collecting and stitching together photos until it is impossible to distinguish between them. Make sure to check out the incredible full resolution photos at his portfolio." &#8211; Who Designed It?
