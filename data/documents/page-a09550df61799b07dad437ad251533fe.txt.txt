QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: robnbecca How do I add lines to my worksheet designs? January 4, 2013  Jessica Tobin (TpT Seller) If you are talking about adding lines on the worksheets that are in this product, they are not editable. If you email me a specific request at jessica.l.tobin@gmail.com, I can add some in for you. January 6, 2013  Tina's Teaching Treasures (TpT Seller) Hey Jessica!! I LOVE your Art literature fun stuff!!! I was wondering if it would be a huge hassle to ask for one with regular (non-double dash) lines? Sometimes my grade 3s are &#039;too cool&#039; for double lines :P (not that they don&#039;t probably need them...but that&#039;s another story). If it is going to take too much time though don&#039;t worry about it- they will survive!! Thanks so much for sharing! :) July 2, 2012  Jessica Tobin (TpT Seller) I added this on there! Just redownload the product and it should be ready with the writing paper sans lines!!
