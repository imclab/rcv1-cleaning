 Bachelor of Science Degree: 184.0 - 189.0 quarter credits 
 
 Students in Drexel’s Entertainment and Arts Management major choose an  area of concentration in media management, performing arts management,  or visual arts management. The curriculum is designed to prepare  students to lead and manage in both non-profit and for-profit areas of  the field. Concentrations are available in: Visual Arts; Performing  Arts; Dance; Theatre; Digital Media; Cinema and Television; and Sports  Entertainment.

In the performing arts management concentration, students choose  coursework in a dance, performing arts, or theatre discipline.

   Writing-Intensive Course Requirements   In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.   A &quot;WI&quot; next to a course in this catalog may indicate that this course can fulfill a writing-intensive requirement. For the most up-to-date list of writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the  Writing Intensive Course List  at the  University Writing Center . Students scheduling their courses can also conduct a search for courses with the attribute &quot;WI&quot; to bring up a list of all writing-intensive courses available that term. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.

 Writing-intensive Requirements 
 In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.
