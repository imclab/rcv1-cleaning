We rounded up 17 convertible car seats that let kids rear-face longer, up to 40 pounds or even higher comments ( ) By Melanie Monroe Rosen &copy; Courtesy of NHTSA.gov/ Enlarge Photo email print share related tags: Baby Gear , car seat safety , Baby &laquo; prev 2 of 20 next &raquo; retweet Alisa Baer, M.D., a pediatrician in New York City and nationally certified child passenger safety instructor (who’s also known as The Car Seat Lady ), suggests that parents of babies look at where their child falls on the growth charts for weight and height to help predict whether a seat with higher limits is needed. To see where your child hits on the growth curves—and what he’ll likely weigh at 2 or 3 years of age, check out these growth charts from the World Health Organization (birth to 2) and the Centers for Disease Control (2 to 20 years): Length-for-age and Weight-for-age percentiles: Boys (Birth to 24 months) Length-for-age and Weight-for-age percentiles: Girls (Birth to 24 months) Stature-for-age and Weight-for-age percentiles: Boys (2 to 20 years) Stature-for-age and Weight-for-age percentiles: Girls (2 to 20 years) Finally, not all car seats fit all cars equally well, especially when rear-facing. To help determine how a particular car seat will fit in your ride, check out CarSeatData.org , a database of car seat measurements that have been gathered by members of car-seat.org . We’ve used their internal seating heights on all our picks.
