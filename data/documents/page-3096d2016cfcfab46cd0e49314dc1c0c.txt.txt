Humor, heartbreak highlight Fairbanks arts & entertainment in 2011 By Suzanna Caldwell / scaldwell@newsminer.com Fairbanks Daily News-Miner newsminer.com  |  0comments  FAIRBANKS - It’s always a little overwhelming to look back on a year of arts and entertainment in Fairbanks. There’s so much — so much of it great — that it’s hard to narrow down to the best. However, each year there’s always that one that seems to stand out among the rest, only waiting to get topped by something bigger and better in 2012. Best local album Brandon Reid, ‘Stuck in the City’ Fairbanks is a small place, but as a whole, sometimes Alaska seems even smaller. When talking about “local” music, I consider it broad. Local, to me, includes Anchorage songstress Marian Call and even Portland, Ore.-based but Wasilla-bred rockers Portugal. The Man. It’s fair to say that any Alaska connection is a local connection. In going through those records, the one that always comes back to me is Brandon Reid’s “Stuck in the City.” Reid was raised in Fairbanks but has toured across the world while calling Interior Alaska home. Reid held a special album release party for Fairbanksans in September. The community had a chance to grab the record before it was released on BandCamp or any other digital sharing device. It was a treat. A mixture of Reid’s church hymnal roots (he first played guitar for his grandma’s church) and stomp-folk rock ’n’ roll style, the album opens with attention-grabbing songs such as “Dead Bones” and the ultra-catchy “Wandering Man.” It then delves into the more serious, relationship-reminiscing of “If I Fell” and “Love Me Yesterday.” It’s a raw and honest account of Reid’s evolution as a musician and a man. Reid is now touring the U.S., hoping to make a go of things. If this album is a mark of things to come, then I can’t wait for more. Best show Brandi Carlile For a town the size of Fairbanks, we sure are lucky. How many places this small, and this far away from “civilization,” can claim to have seen acts like Portugal. The Man, Wait, Wait ... Don’t Tell Me and k.d. lang all in the same year? I doubt many. For me, Brandi Carlile was the show of the year. She came out blazing to a packed house at the Loon in July, performing spirited Carlile classics like “The Story” and “Dreams.” Carlile’s unplugged acoustic rendition of “Dying Day” may not have had the oomph needed for the Loon stage, but she more than made up for it with rocking’ takes on The Beatles (I’ve Just Seen a Face) and the most impressive Johnny Cash mash-up I’ve ever heard. “Jackson” never sounded so enthusiastic paired with “Folsom Prison Blues.” However, I would dare you to find a dry eye after k.d. lang’s comeback cover of “Hallelujah” at her September show at Hering Auditorium. Wait, Wait was full of quirky, delightful current events humor, but it was Paula Poundstone’s quick warm-up act that stole the show before it even started. Her quick take on Fairbanks life, specifically the coffee huts, was spot on. Obviously, I wasn’t the only one delighted. UAF Summer Sessions is bringing Poundstone back for a stand-up show in March. Best theater ‘Macbeth’ No one uses space better than Fairbanks Shakespeare Theatre. Whether outside, dodging rogue squirrels on the Jack Townshend Point stage or perching witches above the audience in the Empress Theater, the experience is guaranteed to be visceral and full-bodied. No production embodied that more than this fall’s “Macbeth.” It was utterly frightening and totally enthralling. With witches lurking in corners and ghosts parading on stage — with blood, swords, daggers, paint and potions abounding — it was hard not to get swept into the eerie fullness of it all. Rebecca Eddy played a hopeless Lady Macbeth to Ray Parshall’s staggeringly tragic Macbeth. However, it was the seven witches who stole the show with their phantom presence, empty eyes and tweaking gestures. Waiting for the hurly-burly to end was never so unnerving. In equally frightening and sad parts was Fairbanks Drama Association’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” Betsy Robertson’s manic Martha was paired painfully perfect with Shannon Luster’s worn-out George. The production was — as it was supposed to be— miserable, booze-filled, awkward and yet thoroughly cathartic — the sort of performance that lingers with you for days. On a lighter note, it was lucky for Fairbanks that Anchorage playwright and director Schatzie Schaefers was able to bring up “Fourplay,” re-titled “Big Wild Comedy,” to the Empress for one weekend in November. Lucky for us to get a chance to see two original Tom Moran pieces, “The Big Guy” and “Duo,” the latter a last-minute addition when the fourth Fourplay show couldn’t make it. Both were irreverent, a little meta, unabashedly nerdy and totally full of side-splitting, belly laughs. Best art show Kes Woodward, ‘New Work, Small Pleasures and a Personal Collection’ In its final year, The Annex Gallery was home to a fantastical collection of works from Fairbanks artists, including a spectacular reshowing of Rachelle Dowdy’s faux animal mounts in “Juggernauts.” But its last show, an exhibition of works by Kes Woodward, not only filled the high, open space of the gallery but also gave viewers an ethereal glimpse of the world we see every day. “New Work, Small Pleasures and a Personal Collection” was a welcome walk back through stages of Woodward’s career. While not a retrospective, many singular pieces were representative of an entire series of the longtime Fairbanksan’s work. Highlights included two of Woodward’s newest snow paintings, including the stunning “Harbinger,” a 5-foot-wide glimpse into Denali National Park. The snow technique offered a frosty, colorful view into the world as seen through Woodward’s eyes. Other highlights included “Solstice Sun,” an “epiphany” painting of downtown Fairbanks, seen through the glare of the sun during the shortest day of the year, and the only once-shown “Chatanika Freeze Up” and “Chatanika Break Up,” two, 6-foot-wide paintings that highlight a classic Woodward style — abstract from close up but realistic from afar. After taking in the mountainous landscapes, colorful birch trees and flowing water, it’s hard not to see the beauty that Woodward sees in the Fairbanks around us and to not be inspired by it. Best new eats Fuji When Wok n’ Roll closed in March, I was surprised and sad. The menu may have been typical Americanized Chinese, but it was fast, mostly tasty and had some killer crab rangoons on the menu. When I heard a Japanese steakhouse was going into the location on College Road, I was a little suspicious. With plenty of great Asian places in town, I figured another couldn’t fill the already full Asian food space in my heart. Well, count that space as filled. Fuji has completely renovated the small space, which once before was the Chinese food equivalent of a hamburger stand, into fully modern, minimalistic space, filled with high-backed black leather chairs and dark wood tables. It is thankfully devoid of florescent lights. The menu is equally impressive, with a wide selection of rolls at reasonable prices. The dinner box special, at $19.99, with its overwhelming array of food — shrimp tempura, miso soup, salad, teriyaki choice, rice and California rolls — is easily one of the best dinner deals in Fairbanks. It’s helped by perfect preparation, a friendly waitstaff and just plain deliciousness. For those looking for a little more, if that’s even possible, the Fuji Love Boat for Two offered up a dozen different fish, plus sushi, sashimi and several special rolls for under $50 and easily could have fed three. Sourdough Take-Home Chef was a blip on the Fairbanks food radar that would have been my top pick if not for its sudden closure this week. It moved inside the Homegrown Market this October after spending the summer season at the Tanana Valley Farmers Market. Having everyday access to locally raised pulled pork sandwiches on Jessica Aldabe’s fresh baked baguettes, with local microgreens and chipotle mayo, was something close to divine. She said on Facebook that she plans to return to both the Farmers Market and the Downtown Market in summer 2012. Hopefully with those sandwiches and some honey garlic bread to boot. It will be a long winter without them. Contact features editor Suzanna Caldwell at 459-7504.
