What They Do -&gt; What Producers and Directors Do About this section Theater directors give instructions to actors and dancers. Producers and directors are in charge of creating motion pictures, television shows, live theater, and other performing arts productions. They interpret a writerâs script to entertain or inform an audience. Duties Producers and directors typically do the following: Select scripts Audition and select cast members and the film or stage crew Approve the design and financial aspects of a production Ensure that a project stays on schedule and within budget Approve new developments in the production Large productions often have associate, assistant, and line producers who share responsibilities. For example, on a large movie set an executive producer is in charge of the entire production, and a line producer runs the day-to-day operations. A TV show may employ several assistant producers, whom the head or executive producer gives certain duties, such as supervising the costume and makeup team. Similarly, large productions usually employ several assistant directors, who help the director with tasks such as making set changes or notifying the performers when it is their time to go onstage. The specific responsibilities of assistant producers or directors vary with the size and type of production they work on. Producers make the business and financial decisions for a motion picture, TV show, or stage production. They raise money for the project and hire the director and crew. The crew may include set and costume designers, a musical director, a choreographer, and other workers. Some producers may assist in the selection of cast members. Producers set the budget and approve any major changes to the project. They make sure that the film or show is completed on time, and they are responsible for the way the finished project turns out. Directors are responsible for the creative decisions of a production. They select cast members, conduct rehearsals, and direct the work of the cast and crew. During rehearsal, they work with the actors to help them portray their characters better. Directors work with designers to build a projectâs set. During a filmâs postproduction phase, they work closely with film editors to make sure that the final product comes out the way the producer and director want. Although directors are in charge of the creative aspects of a show, they ultimately answer to the executive producer. &lt;- Summary Work Environment -&gt; Work Environment About this section Producers and directors audition and select cast members.

Most producers and directors have a bachelorâs degree and several years of work experience in a related occupation, such as an actor or writer. Education Producers and directors usually earn a bachelorâs degree. There are no formal training programs for producers or film directors, but some major in writing, acting, journalism, or communication while in college. Some producers earn a degree in business, arts management, or nonprofit management. Many stage directors complete a degree in theater, and some go on to receive a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree. Classes may include directing, playwriting, and set design, as well as some acting classes. The National Association of Schools of Theater accredits more than 150 programs in theater arts. Work Experience Producers and directors usually have several years of work experience in a related occupation. Many directors begin as actors, writers, film editors, or choreographers, and over the years they learn about directing. Many begin as assistants to successful directors on a film set. For more information, see the profiles on actors , writers and authors , film and video editors and camera operators , or dancers and choreographers . In nonprofit theaters, most aspiring directors begin as assistant directors, a position that is usually treated as an unpaid internship. Producers might start out working in a theatrical management office, as a business manager, or as an assistant or another low-profile job in a TV or movie studio. Some were directors or worked in another role behind the scenes of a show or movie. Advancement As a producerâs or directorâs reputation grows, he or she may work on bigger and more expensive projects. Important Qualities Communication skills . Producers and directors must coordinate the work of many different people to finish a production on time and within budget. Creativity . Because a script can be interpreted in different ways, directors must decide how they want to interpret it and then how to physically represent the scriptâs ideas. Leadership skills . A director instructs actors and helps them portray their characters in a believable manner. Management skills . Producers must find and hire the best director and crew for the production and make sure that all involved do their jobs effectively and efficiently. &lt;- Work Environment Pay -&gt; Pay About this section Producers and Directors Median annual wages, May 2010 Producers and Directors $68,440 Entertainers and Performers, Sports and Related Workers $37,290 Total, All Occupations $33,840 Note: All Occupations includes all occupations in the U.S. Economy. Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics The median annual wage of producers and directors was $68,440 in May 2010. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $32,140, and the top 10 percent earned more than $166,400 in May 2010. Some producerâs and directorâs income is earned as a percentage of ticket sales. A few of the most successful producers and directors have extraordinarily high earnings, but most do not.

Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment Projections program Employment of producers and directors is projected to grow 11 percent from 2010 to 2020, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Job growth in the motion picture and video industry is expected to stem from strong demand from the public for more movies and television shows, as well as an increased demand from foreign audiences for U.S.-produced films. In addition, production companies are experimenting with new content delivery methods, such as mobile and online TV, which may lead to more work for producers and directors in the future. However, these delivery methods are still in their early stages, and their potential for success is not yet known. Employment of self-employed producers and directors is expected to grow 16 percent, faster than that of those in the motion picture industry, as the number of independent films grow. In broadcasting, some producer and director jobs may be lost as radio stations continue to consolidate; however, this loss will be slowed by the publicâs increased desire for local programming in both TV and radio. Producers and directors who work in small and medium-sized theaters may see slower job growth because many of those theaters have difficulty finding funding as the number of performances decline. Large theaters, which usually have more stable sources of funding, should provide more opportunities. Job Prospects Producers and directors face intense competition for jobs because there are many more people who want to work in this field than there are jobs available. In film, directors who have experience on movies sets should have the best job prospects. Producers who have good business skills will likely have the best prospects.
