He was accompanied by frequent sidekick Rande Gerber, the husband of model-actress Cindy Crawford. A-lister co-stars Sandra and George are in Italy for the premiere of their film &#8216;Gravity&#8217; at the 2013 Venice Film Festival. Billed as a techno-thriller, the movie features Bullock and Clooney as a medical engineer and a veteran astronaut stranded in orbit during a Space Shuttle mission. Sandra won an Academy Award for &#8216;The Blind Side&#8217; in 2010.  Her marriage to former &#8216;Monster Garage&#8217; host Jesse James disintegrated shortly thereafter, leaving the actress to raise her adopted New Orleans baby Louis Bardo as a single parent.  He turned 3 in January.

Adam Lambert hit Twitter in support of the &#8216;We Can&#8217;t Stop&#8217; singer, &#8220;Listen, if it wasn&#8217;t your cup of tea&#8211;all good but why is everyone spazzing? Hey, she&#8217;s doing something right.  We&#8217;re all talking.  She was having fun-cut her some slack.&#8221; Lambert made waves of his own by kissing a male bassist on stage and grabbing the crotch of another during the 2009 American Music Awards.  ABC banned the entertainer from appearing on their network for several years &#8211; eventually lifting the ban in 2011. Another advocate speaking out on behalf of the former Disney star is Rolling Stone magazine.  Their kind words so impressed Cyrus that she tweeted a couple of quotes: Billboard executive Bill Werde totally &#8220;got&#8221; the Miley-Robin act, &#8220;Guys, Miley Cyrus is an all-star hot mess for a hot mess pop moment.  She doesn&#8217;t care what you think and that&#8217;s her brand and she just delivered.&#8221; Viacom Media Network&#8217;s president Van Toffler, who owns MTV, had this to say, &#8220;Performers turn it up like athletes on game day.  Did Miley do every move in rehearsal that she did the night of the show? No.  We knew her performance was going to be provocative the way her video is.  But on live TV, the performers turn it up a couple of notches.&#8221;  Ya think? A photo of a decidedly shocked Will Smith family received some major traction on Twitter yesterday, with most sources reporting the fam was reacting to the Miley Cyrus bump and grind performance.  We were deeply disappointed to discover that their collective astonishment was captured on audience cam when Lady Gaga revealed her shell bra and thong. In any case, we loved the image and felt compelled to add it to our very last bit of discourse on the 2013 VMAs.  Carry on&#8230; Photos:  Twitter-Adam Lambert, Video Screen Grabs, Twitter Posted by Meg at 10:25 am Tagged with: adam lambert defends miley cyrus , miley cyrus vma performance fallout , rolling stone defends miley cyrus , viacom president defends miley cyrus Kate Gosselin Files Federal Lawsuit Against Jon Celebrities , Jon Gosselin , Kate Gosselin No Responses &#187; Aug 27 2013 After a period of civility, former reality star Kate Gosselin has put the gloves back on and will be dragging her ex-husband into a Philidelphia federal courtroom to face charges of hacking her computer and phone records, wiretapping and invasion of privacy. Jon Gosselin , a former IT guy, reportedly stole a hard drive from Kate&#8217;s residence and used other illegal means to supply information to a tabloid reporter who was writing a tell-all. Robert Hoffman launched  &#8216;Kate Gosselin: How She Fooled the World&#8217; with Amazon and several other distributors last year but the project was quickly shut down after Kate&#8217;s legal team got a court injunction claiming the controversial details within the book was obtained illegally. Not long ago Jon&#8217;s ex-wife uncovered enough damning evidence to pin the hacking rap on him &#8212; and so she has. Kate Gosselin is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, along with court fees and actual damages.  This is almost laughable since her ex recently described his living situation as a small cabin in a farm community and noted that their parental relationship is &#8220;transportation and logistics.&#8221; Two weeks ago PEOPLE wrote a fluff piece titled &#8216;Kate Gosselin: Her Life After Reality TV.&#8217;  In the article she acknowledged that the family is living very carefully these days and added, &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve lived two lifetimes already.&#8221; Photos:  WENN, PEOPLE, FACEBOOK-Jon Gosselin Posted by Meg at 8:26 am Tagged with: jon gosselin hacking , kate gosselin federal hacking lawsuit , kate gosselin federal lawsuit , kate gosselin sues jon gosselin We Read It On the Internet: Link Love Links No Responses &#187; Aug 27 2013 Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas set to divorce? &#8211; Celebitchy Dave Chappelle poses for the cover of Prince &#8216;s latest song &#8211; Celebrity Smack Simon Cowell and Lauren Silverman cozy in St. Tropez &#8211; Daily Stab Brooke Shields on Hanna Montana Miley Cyrus performance &#8211; Stupid Celebrities Adam Levine developing TV show based on Adam Levine &#8211; Celeb Buzz Neil Patrick Harris set to host 2013 Emmy Awards Show &#8211; Right Celebrity See which celebrities made it to the Scientology Celebrity Centre Gala &#8211; The Superficial Have you ever wondered what would happen if you brought a 6-year-old into a recording studio with expectations of recording a cover song.  Bitten and Bound writer/owner Missy Germain did just that yesterday with Olivia.  Watch the video below to see how that worked out.  Keep in mind the goal was to record a cover of the Katy Perry  single &#8216;Roar.&#8217; Photo Credit: WENN Posted by Missy at 7:23 am Tagged with: Celebrities , Celebrity News , entertainment news , Funny Kid Video , gossip , Hollywood Gossip , Missy Germain Media Watchdog Group Blasts MTV for Miley Cyrus Sex Demo Celebrities , Miley Cyrus , Robin Thicke No Responses &#187; Aug 26 2013 On the day after the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, social media emphatically suggests that Miley Cyrus didn&#8217;t just blur the line Sunday night&#8211;she blatantly crossed it with her controversial performance. Watchdog group, the Parents Television Council, blasted MTV Monday for &#8220;marketing sexually charged messages to young children using former child stars.&#8221; PTC&#8217;s Advisory Board Member Paul Porter contends, &#8220;The Miley Cyrus-Robin Thicke &#8216;Blurred Lines&#8217; performance simply substituted talent with sex.  Heads should roll at MTV.&#8221; Twitter went crazy the moment the pair ended their public grinding, a fact that wasn&#8217;t lost on the 20-year-old who caused the firestorm.  She seemed particularly pleased when she tweeted: The former Disney star&#8217;s parents are also in denial.  Tish Cyrus jumped to her feet after the performance and applauded like a proud mom.  Billy Ray Cyrus tweeted, &#8220;Thanking God for so many blessings tonight.  Continue to pray for world peace. More love &#8230; less hate.&#8221; Neither Robin Thicke nor his wife Paula Patton have updated their Twitter pages.  We can&#8217;t wait to hear what they have to say on the subject.  His racy &#8216;Blurred Lines&#8217; music video raised eyebrows in July because of the sexual content.  When asked about it, he told reporters, &#8220;I can&#8217;t even dignify that with a response.&#8221; One of the common themes we&#8217;ve seen today, suggests that Cyrus was channeling Jim Carrey&#8217;s &#8216;In Living Color&#8217; character Vera De Milo.  We took the opportunity to add his mug as an inset up top for your inspection.
