Its angular silhouette, unconventional edges and distinctive rooflines were all purposefully executed. Every aspect of its design has been crafted with a keen eye for detail. LED TAILLAMPS Signature vertical LED taillamps are longer lasting and more energy efficient than conventional bulbs and create a subtle fin that is pure Cadillac. WIDE STANCE The CTS Coupe displays an assertive, wide stance that gives the coupe an aggressive bearing. More than a mere design statement, a wider stance achieves greater balance and increased responsiveness on the road.   INTERIOR  [if IE 7]> <div id="placeholder-interiorlightingInterior"></div> <![endif] flash Ambient Interior Lighting In the CTS Coupe, thoughtful touches abound. One of the many examples is available Ambient Interior Lighting.

PERFORMANCE  [if IE 7]> <div id="placeholder-powerfulenginePerformance"></div> <![endif] flash Powerful 3.6L Engine There is no overlooking the aggressive power of the CTS Coupe. However, the efficiency with which that power is dispersed is where the true engineering genius can be felt. A powerful 3.6L direct-injection engine delivers 318 HP while the 6-speed automatic transmission provides smooth and effortless shifting. Reduced emissions are achieved through the use of direct-injection technology when compared to engines without it. /content/dam/Cadillac/Global/master/nscwebsite/en/home/Vehicles/2014_Vehicles/2014_CTS_Coupe/Model_Overview/01_images/2014-cts-coupe-performance-engine-thumbnail-88x50.jpg 2014 CTS Coupe Powerful 3.6L Engine video http://brightcovegm.download.edgesuite.net/336226144/336226144_1727418461001_Gunner-50-50-CTSTheChallenge.mp4 Track-Tuned Chassis While horsepower often steals the spotlight, engineering a truly great driver’s car is a careful balancing act.
