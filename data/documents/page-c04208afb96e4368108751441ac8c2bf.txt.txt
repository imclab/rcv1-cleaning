The funeral for William “Bill” Stibor is at 11 a.m. Monday at First-Plymouth Congregational Church, 20th and D streets. Stibor was found dead in his home June 17. He was just 49. His death comes on the heels of that of Jerry Johnston, a longtime producer at NET Radio, who passed away in February. Stibor had been at NET Radio (KUCV 91.1 FM in Lincoln) since 1989, an eternity in the radio business. He hosted the weekday classical music program “Morning Concert” as well as produced and hosted “Friday Live,” the weekly arts and entertainment series that featured music, theater and performance events from across Nebraska. It was in his latter position that he made the most impact. He tirelessly promoted people and events from performing and visual arts organizations that didn’t have large budgets to spend on a bunch of publicity. And Stibor never played favorites, giving as much airtime and attention to the smaller organizations as he did the bigger ones. The out-state organizations really appreciated his efforts to let folks know about their events as well. His listeners grew to know his voice, but many of them may not have known how well he could sing. He boasted a sweet, melodic tenor. He didn’t showcase it often, but when he did, it was quite something to hear. Many of Stibor's friends last week said how hard it would be for NET Radio to replace him. I agree. He had his finger on the pulse of the arts communities in Lincoln and beyond. He will be sorely missed. Around the dial * TVNewsCheck, an online trade publication, recently reported that Gray Television has signed an affiliation agreement with Me-TV Network for its newly acquired station KSNB in the Lincoln/Kearney/Hastings market. Messages left for Jason Effinger, Gray’s general manager in Nebraska, were not returned, but my guess is Gray plans to use Me-TV for its second digital signal, the same way KETV uses the network in Omaha. KSNB also has an affiliation agreement with MyNetwork TV, as previously reported. Me-TV airs reruns of classic TV series, including “M*A*S*H,” “I Dream of Jeannie,” “The Odd Couple” and “The Dick Van Dyke Show.” * Sounds as if veteran broadcaster Dick Janda no longer is with KFOR (1240 AM) and ESPN 1480 (KLMS 1480 AM) at Three Eagles Communications. Messages left with General Manager Joy Patten were not returned. All references to Janda have been removed from both stations. A veteran of both TV and radio in Lincoln, Janda worked in the KFOR newsroom, hosted a sports talk show on ESPN 1480 and handled play-by-play duties for several high school games while at Three Eagles. * Kudos and congratulations go to KLIN’s Kevin Thomas, who recently received a 2013 Edward R. Murrow Award for sports reporting in a small market for his work on the story about Jack Hoffman, the 8-year-old suffering from brain cancer who gained national attention for his appearance in the Nebraska football team’s spring game.

Reply Report Abuse Get it right - June 24, 2013 11:28 am Maybe for making announcements before they were to be released to the public? Just guessing. Reply Report Abuse jimomaha - June 24, 2013 6:58 am Why wouldn't KFOR say a good-bye, on air, to Dick if he was leaving? Unless KFOR got rid of him on their own. But why would they? What could Dick have possibly done to deserve a boot out? Reply Add Comment You must Login to comment.
