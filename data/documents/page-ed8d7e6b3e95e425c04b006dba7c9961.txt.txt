After researching almost every car seat, I finally decided on this car seat to protect my first child. All car seats meet or exceed the national highway safety administration requirements IF they are installed correctly. As a firefighter I installed hundreds of car seats and upon arrival at the fire station, I would estimate that 99% of them were installed incorrectly. If a car seat even moves just slightly on the seat, it is not installed correctly. It should be installed so tightly that the entire car shakes when you try and move the car seat. Overall, I'd recommend this product to my patients. However, because of the price, I recommend trading in you old car seat during one of Toys R Us or Babies R Us' trade-in events to get 25% off of the car seat. I'd also recommend getting an extra base for each additional car you own. I chose this car seat because of the base that is installed once and is used for both rear and forward facing positions. That means less chances for error and improper installation. The base is much easier to install. Older car seats installed in a vehicle with w/o latch anchors require 2 people to install correctly. I was able to easily install this in my 1992 Honda Accord by myself. The installation into my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee w/ anchors was 10x easier. Once the base is installed, the seat can be easily adjusted to keep it at the correct level. Furthermore, the seat is rated for up to 40 lbs for rear facing infants which meets the American Academy of Pediatrics new recommendation for rear facing until 2 years old. In addition, the car seat has a steel frame which greatly increases the strength of the seat. If you have more than one vehicle, I would definitely recommend this car seat with additional bases. CONS: Because of the steel frame, the seat is heavier than most seats and the large size makes it difficult to move from vehicle to vehicle. In my 1992 Honda, the passenger seat needs to be moved up all the way. However, when installed in the rear center seat of my 2004 Jeep Cherokee and 2005 Dodge Ram, the both front seats can be adjusted easily. However, my wife has not had any difficulty moving the seat from my Honda to the Jeep and vice versa."

I am so pleased with this seat! I love that it's convertible, it's cushy, it reclines, and it's safe. My son loves it too. He usually gets a little fussy in his old carseat, but not this one! Yes it's a little bulky. It's three carseats in one! It's a little heavy, but it's reinforced with steel bands! Some reviews made it sound like it was 700 lbs. I highly recommend this seat. I have yet to purchase anything from Graco that doesn't exceed my expectations!" In my new seat!

It was as SIMPLE making a peanut butter sandwich! EASY AS 1-2-3! My front passenger seat is NOT moved all the way up, in fact its almost pretty far back and I even tested it (at 5'9&quot;) with the carseat reclined and in upright position. I don't understand the reviews on here, maybe some of you don't read English (or Spanish) well, or are just NOT mechanically inclined, because my DOG could install this seat, blind folded! YES, the seat is on the bigger side, but my LONG, 30&quot;, 21LB 9Month old fits in it PERFECTLY, LIKE A GLOVE.. I feel that this seat is sturdy, well made and S_A_F_E, just what it SHOULD BE.. I don't understand all the bad reviews and whining complaints about it- clearly if you have a SMALL CAR this seat is NOT the one for you.. Don't knock the GOOD QUALITY of this product just because you drive a compact (Honda Civic, etc) non-SUV vehicle.. This Graco Seat is safe and will protect your precious bundle on the road. I recommend this to all of my friends and family members with children as the first or next step carseat.. I purchased an extra base, for my Husbands truck, a 2011 Chevy Silverado, with extended crew cab and I will most definitely NOT have a problem installing it in his truck either. Our first purchase was a Chicco KeyFit30 travel system and it was easy to carry a newborn in, however she has gotten so heavy that we had to move up to the next convertible carseat.. You will NOT be disappointed with this product.. Stop with the bad reviews already!!"

I love how it converts 4 different ways, and has a recline handle to change how far your child reclines as he/she grows. It is very comfortable for my child, and very sturdy and safe. I especially love how this seat has a head rest handle that allows you to adjust the harness straps with out having to undo the straps from under the seat as your child grows. All you do is with one hand pull up and the harness belt is instantly bigger, no hassle! Also, this seat has a sign that tells you that the seat is securely latched to the base. Also, I love that this seat is a convertible seat with xtra bases avail for easy transition from one car to the next. The seat is 40 pounds, so it is a bit heavy, but I can lift it just fine. I do wish that they had made the latches to the crotch belt as big as they made the Graco Snug Ride 35's, they are a bit small and tend to fall down in the seat and get &quot;lost&quot;, but its not a big deal. Also, I don't recommend this seat for a vehicle any smaller than a Jeep liberty, bc it is a rather large seat, but I like that about it. All in all, this seat is by far the best car seat for all the right reasons, and I recommend it to all parents who have a vehicle capable of accommodating it."

It also gives you an opportunity to see it in person versus only online. There were some brands that I was &quot;sold&quot; on just from the images but once I got to BRU they were totally taken off my list. Some were too long in height, too wide, not enough padding, cheap fabric, etc. So if you can go to the store, look at all the car seats, play around with them, put your child in it and most importantly test it in your car. I have a 2012 Jeep Cherokee and tested the Graco Smart Seat before buying it (I honestly don't know how this would fit in anything other than a SUV but if you can, more power to you). The only thing I did not do was put the driver and passenger seats back with the BRU floor sample in the back. It was 90 degrees outside so we basically rushed it. Do not rush, take your time, have the sales associate install it, ask questions but move your seats back to the positions your normally use. YOU NEED TO DO THIS as it plays a big part in decision making and location of the car seat in the back seat. This car seat is wide and big so it will take up a lot of room. -Latch system only allows for you to put the car seat behind the passenger or driver side. If you want it in the middle you have to use the seat belt. So it becomes the parent 's choice of latch system but on the side or seat belt but in the middle -No matter where you put the car seat, middle or side (in rear facing), it will eat up a lot of the driver/passenger leg space -I have the car seat in RF in the middle back seat and am comfortable since I'm 5'2&quot;. My husband is 6'2&quot; and can't drive with it in the middle in RF. In forward facing, yes, but RF no. He would have to move it behind the passenger side just to have enough room. So play around with it in your car to see what works best for you -I find the harness and clips very easy to undo and they do not tangle easily. If they do for you then I suggest investing in some Lula clips as they help. -I did have to move the crotch strap to the second position and it was difficult at first. But when you remove it from the first position tilt the clip up towards your face and push through. I originally tilted it down away from my face and it kept getting caught. After realizing that it took my less than a minute to move it to the second position -Locking the car seat into the base can be very tricky but the lock/unlocked indicators help. Just make sure that all four indicators are too locked. I almost forgot once and the back ones were not locked but the front were. Luckily I double checked it and fixed it. -My son is very comfortable in this car seat and even though it is reclined back more (due to the level indicator) than his infant car seat was, he is higher up and can see more out the window. -With the deep recline in RF I don't have to worry about his head slumping forward when he falls asleep -The SIP padding by his head is very soft and not hard like other brands. I don't have to worry about his head hitting hard plastic covered in cloth. -The arm rests and cup holder provides him with some entertainment when he gets tired with his toys -Even in the middle back seat I still have plenty of room on the sides if I have passengers -This car seat is a beast and very durable so I have the peace of mind knowing my son is safe in it -I would have given it 5 stars but the size of the car seat can make it difficult for the driver and passenger Again, try and test it in your car as the Graco Smart Seat is wide and even taller with the base. It is along the more expensive car seats but look out for the sales or coupons that don't exclude Graco and use it! Get the protection plan too since Graco will reimburse you the cost for any wear and tear or damages to the car seat. The protection plan is good for 15 months."

My daughter is almost 1 1/2 and is still rear facing. A drunk driver rearended us going 40-50 miles an hour. My daughter was sleeping in this car seat at the time and when i pulled her out all she had sustained as far as injuries was an abrasion on her chin.I truly believe this car seat saved my baby girl from serious injuries. YES IT IS HEAVY. Parents who cares if its heavy when your moving it from car to car. I understand but im telling you coming from a mom who was in a car accident with her child you want to make sure you have the most safe and secure thing you can find and if it happens to be heavy then take the good with the bad. I also understand that its large and for some cars doesnt fit. But we have a altima and fits fine i put her in the middle because why would you want them anywhere else unless you have no other choice because you have other children. But i can tell you that when that man hit us, it moved our WHOLE back set up and because this car seat is so BIG AND BULKY AND HEAVY it protected our daughter. We are now buying the car seat for a SECOND time since once your car seat is in a accident it is no longer safe to use. So the guys insurence is covering to buy our daughter a new one and yes were buying the exact same one. After looking at reviews just to make sure this was the right decision this is still the best i see. Two things kept my daughter safe that day number one GOD and his Grace and THIS CAR SEAT! Dont be cheap on your car seats. One of the most important things you might buy for your baby. Play it safe!"
