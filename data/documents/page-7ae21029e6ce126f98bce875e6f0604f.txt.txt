Humor, skill displayed in art by hospital employees By Ryan D. WilsonNews Editor Clay Center Dispatch  |  0comments  Artwork on display in the dining room of Clay County Medical Center show that hospital staff aren’t just talented in their profession, they also bring artistic ability to the table. Submitted works include a set of six photographs by assistant director of radiology Justin Begnoche, who started his own photography business; photography by hospital CEO Ron Bender; oil painting, watercolor and a pen and pencil drawing by Tyce Young, clinic representative in the hospital’s IT department; paintings by Lori Beikman, who’s employed in planning and development department of the hospital; and three cross-stick pieces by Linda Yarrow, dietitian at Clay County Medical Center. Young, who oil painting is titled “Jesus Chris Super Car” said he enjoys art “that displays an obscure sense of humor.” His pen and pencil drawing portrayed the famous “Big Boy” restaurant icon in a new job working for the circus. “I really enjoy illustrations of children’s books,” Young said in the artist statement accompanying the artwork. Beikman, who took art classes at Kansas State University, said in her artist’s statement said her favorite art styles are expressionism and impressionism and names sever post-impressionist artists as her favorite artists, including Picasso and Van Gogh. Her paintings emulated styles of those artists. The four on display are large paintings titled  Waiting, Coffee Break, Two Women and Last Call. One of Linda Yarrow’s cross-stitch pieces is a wedding portrait of her in-laws that Yarrow designed herself and took 240 hours to stitch. Yarrow has cross-stitched for 30 years. The Lord’s Prayer on display is one of her favorite pieces and the “Susan Singleton” piece is a reproduction of a piece stitched by 12-year-old girl in 1760. “The types of designs I like change through the years,” Yarrow said her artist statement. “My current focus is on historical reproductions and primitive and Adam and Eve samplers.” The employee art show runs until Aug. 12 and will be followed by the employee family art show, which starts Aug. 13, Lorene Peterson’s watercolors on display beginning Sept. 3; Keath Meyers’ photography starting on Oct. 15; and Fleta Hanlon’s artwork starting Feb. 10.
