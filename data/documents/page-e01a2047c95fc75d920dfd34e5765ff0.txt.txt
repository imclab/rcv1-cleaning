LARSEN: Anthony Jeselnik’s ‘Caligula’ overplays offensive humor Andrew Larsen Daily Nebraskan  |  0comments  “I’ve been searching for my girlfriend’s killer for two years, but nobody wants to do it.” That’s actually one of the tamest jokes on “Caligula,” Anthony Jeselnik’s latest stand-up comedy album. The first track is titled “Rape,” and the closer is “Shut The Fuck Up.” About a third of the way through he even tells the audience, “If you didn’t know who you were dealing with, now you know.” What we’re dealing with is a comedian who has built a clever — but ultimately tiring — persona, as a man who will say literally anything to get a laugh. It’s not a lowbrow, “Blue Collar Comedy Tour” barrel scraping; it’s more a gross George Carlin tribute. He starts off talking about rape, “So I know what kind of audience I’m dealing with.” Rape is a subject from which many comedians try and fail to generate laughs, but Jeselnik’s arrogant milieu makes it work. He’s like a very confident lounge lizard who says the first dirty thing that comes to his mind. Jeselnik grew to fame by appearing on Comedy Central’s annual roasts. At first he was the generic-looking guy that the more “famous” comedians viewed with ambivalence and puzzlement. He quickly proved himself as one of the only consistently funny roasters, never pulling punches no matter how honored the guest. After two full-length albums, it feels like his vulgar, punchline-dependent comedy works better in the quick-burst format rather than the 45-minute special. That’s made clear when some of the biggest laughs of the night come from his questions and subsequent slams of the lucky folks in the front row. When he interacts with real people — audience members or roasters on the dais — his barbs have an extra sting. Unfortunately, most of his jokes on “Caligua” start off in generics. Many of them use the placeholder “my girlfriend,” “my ex-girlfriend” or “my friend.” Most comedians play on these subjects, but Jeselnik’s jokes are transparently crafted to come up with the nastiest punchline possible, rather than getting at some sort of funny collective truth. Louis C.K. is incredibly filthy as well, but his jokes seem to come from a real place. He is raw and offensive while still remaining a real, funny person. Jeselnik, rather, seems to speak as a constructed comedian, which makes it hard to enjoy him on anything more than a surface level. There is absolutely no taboo Jeselnik won’t poke a giant stick at. He mows through necrophilia, burn victims, bulimia, child abuse, spousal abuse, alcoholism, divorce, pornography, mental disabilities, abortion, atheism and of course, the Holocaust. A few of these jokes in a rapid-fire format work well, but placed successively, they tend to have a numbing effect. The more outlandish and vulgar he gets, the more desensitized we become. He’s a funny guy who’s excellent at setting up a joke, but on “Caligula,” his offensive routine wears out its w come. arts@dailynebraskan.com on twitter @dnartsdesk More about Larsen ARTICLE : LARSEN: 26-hour technology fast evokes ‘excitedly naked feeling’ ARTICLE : LARSEN: Springtime depression rears its ugly, pre-graduation head ARTICLE : LARSEN: Lack of structured plans evokes pre-graduation fury ARTICLE : LARSEN: Writer takes on his prisoner: a Love Library bathroom stall [if IE 6]> <link media="screen" href="http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dailynebraskan.com/content/tncms/live/components/core_social_share/resources/styles/social_share_ie6.css?_dc=1375260413" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> <![endif]  Discuss Print  Posted in Arts and entertainment  on  Wednesday, February 13, 2013 12:00 am.
