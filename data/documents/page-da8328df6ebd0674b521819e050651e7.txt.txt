It wasn't boredom making people anxious, though. It was the anticipation of hearing Pulitzer Prize-winning humor columnist Dave Barry pontificate on politics, men and women, and a variety of other topics completely unrelated to retail merchandising. The meeting took place at the Richmond Hyatt. After a meal of surf and turf, the association chairman, Steve Barnett, got down to business with the announcement of the 1999 distinguished Retailer. The recipients this year were Andrew Thornton and Sarah T. Paxton, owners of LaDiffĂŠrence , the international home furnishings store in Shockoe Bottom. Next up was Richmond Times-Dispatch Editorial Pages Editor Ross Mackenzie, who introduced Dave Barry. Then Barry, who looks like the guy next door, took the stage. He faced a crowd full of business people begging for a good laugh. Barry delivered. His 30-minute talk was exactly what you'd expect from the man who wrote these lines in a column called "Dave Barry on Meetings": "The modern business meeting might be better compared with a funeral, in the sense that you have a gathering of people who are wearing uncomfortable clothing and would rather be somewhere else. The major difference is that most funerals have a definite purpose. Also, nothing is ever really buried in a meeting." In his brief talk, Barry somehow touched on everything from scandal in the White House to baby poop. And to his credit, he tried really hard to relate his often hysterical anecdotes to the retail industry. For instance, his conclusion to a story about the Oregon highway department resorting to dynamite as a way to remove a beached whale from the shoreline was, "If in business we have a problem to solve, this isn't the way to do it." His most valiant effort to make a connection with the merchants in the room was by referring to himself as the "retail merchant of humor." The main difference, Barry said to the audience is "you go to work and take care of customers, and I sit at home in my underwear and make stuff up." Not talking about retail wasn't a strike against Barry - the crowd's constant laughter was proof of that. In fact, Barry captivated the audience so much that he was able to even poke fun at Richmond's most beloved retailers, the Ukrops, without being thrown out of the hotel for blasphemy. Turning to Bobby Ukrop's table in the ballroom, Barry said coyly: "I'm going to offer you this slogan for free. Ukrop spelled backward is Pork U."
