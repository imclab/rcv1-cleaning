The museum&#39;s collection represents more than 6,000 years of human history, with new exhibitions popping up every few months. In addition to an acclaimed collection of fine art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, also schedules a number of performances, workshops, and lectures that add depth to the many pieces displayed in the museum. The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston is one of the premier museums in the nation, and has become popular with art lovers around Houston. In addition to being the largest museum in Texas (and one of the largest in the US), the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston is also the oldest in the state, opened in 1924. The museum is more of a complex than a single building, comprised of four separate buildings and the Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen Sculpture Garden. The Caroline Wiess Law Building features most of the pieces currently on display, while the Audrey Jones Beck Building showcases the rest. The Glassell School of Art is also located on the &quot;campus&quot;, and schedules most of the lectures, classes, and workshops for students and aspiring artists. The Central Administration and Glassesl Junior School of Art Building is fairly self-explanatory, housing the administrative staff and providing art classes for children. A schedule of performances, events, classes, lectures, and workshops is available above, so stop by one of the most prestigious museums in Texas for an unforgettable fine art experience.
