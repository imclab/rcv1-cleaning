Lamar Odom -- The NBA Drug Trail  Robin Thicke&#039;s Wife NOT Mad at Miley CyrusFor Molesting Hubby At VMAs 2 Chainz Arrest -- Cops Say Rapper&#039;s Friend Waved Around Constitution Lady Gaga -- ASS ON PARADE for Joseph Gordon-Levitt Pippi Longstocking Star Sex Tape Being Shopped -- She&#039;s Coming Into Your Town Alright CELEBS VIDEOS PHOTOS SPORTS TV 8/25/2013 12:20 PM PDT BY TMZ STAFF Lamar Odom Missing Family &amp; Friends Worried Exclusive Lamar Odom has vanished and everyone in his life fears the worst -- that he's off somewhere on a drug binge ... TMZ has learned. Sources connected to the NBA star tell us people on Lamar's side, and on the Kardashian side have not been able to find Lamar or contact him for nearly 72 hours -- and we're told the main concern is he's hiding out while doing crack cocaine. As TMZ first reported ... Khloe Kardashian threw him out of the house Wednesday after attempting an intervention which Lamar squarely rejected. We've already told you Lamar's been battling addiction for at least 2 years -- and even reluctantly agreed to go to rehab in San Diego a year ago ... although he bailed after 3 weeks. Our sources tell us Lamar has gone off the hinges since basketball season ended and he became a free agent. We're told his drug addiction is the core reason why his marriage to Khloe has fallen apart. Short story ... everyone's worried. 3:00 PM PST: We spoke to a rep for Lamar who says Lamar is fine, however he would not say anything about his whereabouts.

TMZ has learned.&#160; TMZ broke the story ... Lamar has gone off the rails with drug use ... which is the principal cause of the crisis in his marriage to Khloe Kardashian .&#160; As we reported Lamar went to a rehab facility a year ago this month and stayed for 3 weeks before bailing -- and we're told the problem was crack. Sources say Lamar's crack use was extreme before he went to rehab, but he cleaned up his act during the basketball season that just ended.&#160; Sources say shortly after he hung up his jersey, he started again with a bang. As we reported ... Khloe threw Lamar out of the house a few days ago after he rejected an attempt at an intervention. It's unclear how Lamar's problem will affect his basketball career. We made calls to Lamar's reps.&#160; So far, no comment.

It all went down at Taylor's concert in L.A. Saturday night. The pretty-straight-laced singer has been inviting a slew of guests to perform with her on tour: Sara Bareilles , Ellie Goulding , Tegan and Sara ... acts that fit the Taylor mold. But Saturday she threw that out the window and brought out Jennifer Lopez instead to sing " Jenny From the Block " as a duet ... and even tried to rock some fly girl moves. FYI Taylor fans: fly girls were dancers on " In Living Color ."&#160;You probably weren't born yet.

Because I&#039;m Freaking Tired Exclusive Tyrese straight up FAINTED inside a nightclub Friday and was sent to the hospital -- but don't worry he's fine now ... he just needed some shut-eye, ASAP. Tyrese made an appearance at The Park nightclub in D.C. -- along with new TGT bandmates Ginuwine and Tank -- when things took a turn for the worse and Tyrese PASSED OUT in the middle of partying, hitting the floor so hard he injured his arm. A rep for Tyrese tells TMZ ... everything is okay, the whole ordeal was due to pure exhaustion. The rep explains "Tyrese has been going non-stop since July promoting his new TGT album." Tyrese posted a pic of himself in the hospital afterwards, along with Tank, sporting an arm sling ... ramifications from the fall. We're told he's already back in L.A. Hopefully napping.

Or Else Exclusive Riff Raff doesn't take too kindly to pictures of him allegedly masturbating being plastered all over the Internet ... and is now using his legal goons to make sure they disappear for good. Riff had his lawyers fire off a cease and desist letter to TheDirty.com ... after the website posted pics of the rapper on a bed, holding his penis ... allegedly masturbating in front of a female hair stylist. In the letter, Riff is pissed ... he says the story is B.S. and by using the pics the site is damaging his reputation. He says if the site doesn't take the snap shots down he'll sue their pants off.

Tyler -- famous for his bloody Lindsay Lohan art, among other things -- sold the piece to Scott Patterson ... known to people with TVs as Luke from "GG". The sale did more than just line Tyler's pockets. We're told he specifically created the piece with the intention of using it to finance his first film " The Outlaw " (which he wrote, directs and stars in). In fact, the models in the pic are two of the flick's stars. FUN FACT: the $500,000 pic is bigger than it looks on your tiny computer ... 16 feet by 9 feet ... i.e. the size of a wall in your house.
