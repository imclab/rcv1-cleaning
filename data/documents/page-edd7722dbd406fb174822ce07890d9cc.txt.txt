Welcome to the LA Auto Show Photo: ANDREW ENGLISH By Andrew English 4:49PM GMT 18 Nov 2010 Comments As Arnie the governator bows out in favour of his replacement, Jerry Brown, California is facing tough economic conditions and some stark financial choices &ndash; just like the rest of us, then. For the motor industry, the darkest days, where the lights were literally turned off at the LA Auto Show, seem to be receding. With a 14.6 per cent rise in the first nine months of 2010, California&rsquo;s new car sales have bounced off the recession faster than the rest of the US. Top selling cars are still Hondas and Toyotas, but the Japanese have made heavy going of maintaining their position, and Toyota&rsquo;s latest 1.5 million strong recall for brake-fluid leaks has helped the US domestic industry to fill the gap. Volkswagen is hoping its $4 billion investment in products and its new Chattanooga plant to build the mid-sized sedan will allow it to fill some of that gap. No surprise that new VW USA boss, Jonathan Browning, was in bullish mood. VW America&rsquo;s top job has been something of a poisoned chalice in the past, but Browning says he&rsquo;s confident that the VW board are determined to &ldquo;make VW a significant volume player in the US market.&rdquo; He denies that he&rsquo;s buried the chalice under the basement of his new Washington home. Reflecting the financial climate, is a new reality on electric cars. VW has always been cautious and Dr Ulrich Hackenberg, board member responsible for research and development, remains so. &ldquo;Electric cars will need to be affordable and practical and in widespread daily use before we can state that we are in the electric age,&rdquo; he said. VW&rsquo;s two electric contenders, the tiny Up and the Golf, will not be on sale until 2013 and Hackenberg confirmed that the battery Golf will be based on the Mark VII model rather than the current Mark VI.

These figures are predicated on a stable oil price, which as we all know is something of a unicorn state of affairs. While US gas prices remain at around $3.20 a US gallon (58 pence per litre) there&rsquo;s a big memory loss about the days of $4 plus a US gallon. And while the Nymex price of West Texas Intermediate remains at under $85 a barrel, it doesn&rsquo;t take much for the market to run scared. Whether that&rsquo;s for genuine reasons of supply and demand or not is immaterial - the fact is the oil price is a momentarily slumbering giant and when it wakes again we&rsquo;ll all be looking at the myriad alternatives. And the one prediction you can take to the bank is that they&rsquo;ll all be more expensive. Looking for more information on a specific car? Order a brochure or test drive some of the latest cars.
