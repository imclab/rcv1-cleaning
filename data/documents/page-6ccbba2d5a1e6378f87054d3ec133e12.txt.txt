On Tuesday the downtown theater company announced it will mount two full productions in 2013-14: the New York premiere of David Adjmi’s &#8220;Marie Antoinette,&#8221; and &#8220;An Octoroon&#8221; by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. &#8220;Marie Antoinette&#8221; (Oct. 9-Nov. 3) is Mr. Adjmi&#8217;s (&#8220;3C&#8221;) modern take on the doomed French queen. The show had its premiere last year at Yale Rep in a coproduction with American Repertory Theater. Reprising their roles from that production will be the actors Marin Ireland as Marie, Steven Rattazzi as Louis XVI and David Greenspan as a sheep. Rebecca Taichman will direct. The play is Ms. Ireland&#8217;s first role at Soho Rep since her heralded turn in Sarah Kane&#8217;s &#8220;Blasted&#8221; in 2008. Other cast members include Marsha Stephanie Blake, Karl Miller and Jen Ikeda; additional casting is to be announced. In his review of the show at Yale Rep , Charles Isherwood called it a &#8220;cursory comic strip of a play&#8221; that echoes the Marie depicted in Sofia Coppola&#8217;s anachronistic, punk-infused movie starring Kirsten Dunst.

Everest Expedition to Show at London Festival By DANIEL MCDERMON Prakash Mathema/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Mount Everest, center. A newly restored version of a film documenting an early attempt to climb Mount Everest will be shown as part of this year&#8217;s BFI London Film Festival, the British Film Institute announced on Tuesday . &#8220;The Epic of Everest,&#8221; directed by the British explorer Capt. John Noel, followed the 1924 expedition led by George Mallory, in which both Mallory and another climber, Andrew Irvine, died . It remains unknown whether Mallory and Irvine  made it to Everest&#8217;s summit before they disappeared &#8212; if they did, they would have beaten Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay by nearly 30 years. The 1924 attempt was the third British-led expedition to Everest. Noel also filmed and photographed the second expedition, in 1922. For the 1924 effort, according to a report in The Times , Noel used four cameras, aiming to capture &#8220;the fascination of those secluded, lofty, divinely beautiful mountains of Tibet and the implacable majesty of the supreme mountain herself.&#8221; In a statement, Robin Baker, the film institute&#8217;s head curator, said &#8220;The Epic of Everest&#8221; portrayed &#8220;a key moment in the history of mountaineering and remains an enduring monument to Mallory and Irvine.&#8221; After the Oct. 18 premiere of the restoration at the festival, &#8220;The Epic of Everest&#8221; will also be released in British theaters. The restoration includes a new score composed by Simon Fisher Turner, who will perform it live at the premiere. The BFI London Film Festival runs  Oct. 9 to Oct. 20. August 27, 2013, 2:50 pm Q. &#038; A.: Cassandra Clare on &#8216;The Mortal Instruments&#8217; By BLANCA MELENDEZ Rafy/Screen Gems From left, Jemima West, Robert Sheehan and Lily Collins in &#8220;The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,&#8221; adapted from Cassandra Clare&#8217;s novel. “City of Bones,” the film adaptation of the first book in Cassandra Clare’s young adult fantasy series “The Mortal Instruments,” opened last week. In a recent phone interview, Ms. Clare spoke about the film, her forthcoming middle-grade series, writing with Holly Black (author of “Doll Bones” and “The Spiderwick Chronicles”) and what readers can expect from “City of Heavenly Fire,” the final novel in the “Mortal Instruments” series, due  next May. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation: Q. Was there any scene or character you were particularly excited to see in the film? A. Magnus Bane, who is a trickster figure. I was worried they would cut him. I had to tell them he was a very important character who becomes more important. I was excited to see his scenes in action. Q. Are there any specific things you had a say in during the adaption process? A. I had a lot of say in casting. They definitely invited me into the casting process and showed me audition tapes, and every person cast was a conversation about the pros and cons and how they fit in with the larger puzzle of the character.

Read more&#8230; August 27, 2013, 10:40 am Make It Funky: James Brown Biopic Finds Its Leading Man By DAVE ITZKOFF Hans Edinger/Associated Press The hardest-working man in show business: James Brown. The producers of a planned biographical film on the Godfather of Soul,  James Brown,  are feeling good &#8212; good enough to move forward with the movie now that they have an actor to play Brown and a green light from Universal on the project. Variety reported that the as-yet untitled film will star Chadwick Boseman, who portrayed Jackie Robinson  this year in &#8220;42,&#8221; as Brown, the pioneering R&amp;B singer who died in 2006 . Chris Pizzello/Invision, via Associated Press Chadwick Boseman The biopic, which is being directed by Tate Taylor (&#8220;The Help&#8221;) and written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (&#8220;Fair Game&#8221;), will chronicle Brown&#8217;s life from his impoverished upbringing in the South to his cape-wearing , can&#8217;t-get-him-off-the-stage heyday. No release date was announced for the film, which is being produced by Imagine Entertainment and Jagged Films, the film company of Mick Jagger, a man who surely knows a thing or two about sweaty stage theatrics. August 27, 2013, 8:00 am In Performance: Sarah Lemp of &#8216;The Cheaters Club&#8217; By ERIK PIEPENBURG &#8220;The Cheaters Club,&#8221; a new play from Derek Ahonen, is a dark comedy set at a haunted inn run by a mysterious family in Savannah, Ga. In this scene , Mama, played by Sarah Lemp, talks about the ghostly happenings in Room 305.

August 26, 2013, 8:36 pm Zajick Pulls Out of &#8216;Dolores Claiborne&#8217; By MICHAEL COOPER Dolora Zajick will not be Dolores Claiborne after all. With less than a month before the San Francisco Opera is to present the world premiere of “Dolores Claiborne,” a new Tobias Picker opera based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, the company announced on Monday that Ms. Zajick, the acclaimed mezzo-soprano who had been set to sing the title role, had withdrawn from the production. Ms. Zajick said in a statement that she was “devastated” to be unable to continue, citing knee problems and explaining that “the opera proved to be more challenging physically and vocally than I had anticipated.” Read more&#8230; August 26, 2013, 5:17 pm Weekly Ticket Sales Drop Under $1 Million for Broadway&#8217;s &#8216;Spider-Man&#8217; By PATRICK HEALY Sara Krulwich/The New York Times A scene with the original cast of &#8220;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&#8221; at the Foxwoods Theater. For the first time since performances began in November 2010, the Broadway musical “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” took in less than $1 million for a standard eight-performance playing week, with last week’s gross totaling $966,952. While ticket sales have been softening since last fall for the $75 million musical, the most expensive in Broadway history, a spokesman on Monday linked last week’s total to “fallout” from a well-publicized foot injury suffered by the cast member Daniel Curry during the Aug. 15 performance. The record-low $966,952 gross is notable because, over the last two years, the &#8220;Spider-Man&#8221; producers have explicitly pointed to their seven-figure grosses as a sign of audience validation for a musical that critics widely panned. The producers have also been optimistic about earning back the show’s $75 million capitalization, but that feat would require weekly box office grosses in the $1.5 million range for several years. Last week’s gross was below the show’s weekly running costs, which are in the low seven figures, and far below the $2.94 million that the show grossed for nine performances during the New Year’s holiday week in the 2011-12 season. That week set a record for the highest gross ever on Broadway. Read more&#8230; August 26, 2013, 3:57 pm New York Film Festival to Showcase Documentaries on Science and Democracy By DANIEL MCDERMON Movies  about science and democracy and a series devoted to cinematic portraiture will anchor the documentary portion of the New York Film Festival, the Film Society of Lincoln Center said on Monday . The Applied Science series will present three films about technology: Mark Levinson&#8217;s &#8220;Particle Fever&#8221; tells the story of the physicists at CERN and the search for the Higgs boson; &#8220;Google and the World Brain,&#8221; directed by Ben Lewis, recounts the search giant&#8217;s efforts to digitize the collections of the world&#8217;s libraries; and &#8220;Tim&#8217;s Vermeer,&#8221; directed by Teller, investigates the techniques used by the 17th-century painter. Another series, How Democracy Works Now, will focus on films by Michael Camerini and Shari Robertson. They set out in 2001 to track efforts to overhaul immigration in the United States, following advocates and legislators in Washington in efforts to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. The filmmakers plan to complete 12 films in total; 10 are to be presented in the festival. Motion Portraits, the last series, will include eight features that take decidedly different approaches toward the portrait. Among them are Nancy Buirski&#8217;s &#8220;Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq,&#8221; which illuminates Le Clercq&#8217;s role as the wife and muse of George Balanchine, and &#8220;The Dog,&#8221; directed by Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren, which recounts the tale of John Wojtowicz, whose attempt to rob a Chase Manhattan Bank in Gravesend, Brooklyn, inspired the film &#8220;Dog Day Afternoon.&#8221; The festival opens on Sept. 27. A full list is at the film festival&#8217;s Web site . August 26, 2013, 2:10 pm MTV Awards Show Prompts Familiar Complaint By JAMES C. MCKINLEY JR. Eric Thayer/Reuters Robin Thicke and Miley Cyrus at the Video Music Awards show on Sunday. MTV has once again outraged an advocacy group that wants to reduce the level of adult content and profanity on television. The Parents Television Council , a nonprofit group known for criticizing shows, including &#8220;Family Guy,&#8221; for explicit content and adult jokes, took the network to task for airing condom ads and staging performances with skimpy costumes and sexually suggestive dancing during the Video Music Awards on Sunday. Some viewers have said that Miley Cyrus&#8217;s performance , which included miming coitus with Robin Thicke and rump-shaking among dancing bears, was in particularly poor taste. The Parents Television Council&#8217;s complaint about the show, which echoes similar statements it has made in years past, took on greater weight this year because Ms. Cyrus&#8217;s father, Billy Ray Cyrus, sits on the group&#8217;s advisory board . Representatives for Mr. Cyrus did not respond to requests for comment, but he may have made his opinion known on Twitter last night, writing : &#8220;Thanking God for so many blessings tonight. Continue to pray for world peace. More love &#8230; less hate.&#8221; MTV rated the program TV-14, which means the program &#8220;contains some material that many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years of age.&#8221; But the Parents Television Council said the show crossed a line and that the network should have warned parents against letting 14-year-olds &#8212; eighth graders, typically &#8212; view it without supervision. They also complained that the ads for birth control and R-rated movies during the show were aimed at an adult audience.
