Sports coupes are fun to drive, stylish coupes or hatchbacks that pack lots of features into a compact footprint at an affordable price. Most sports coupes are powered by four-cylinder engines and have front-wheel drive. A few have V6 engines and offer all-wheel drive as an option. They range in price from $15,000 to about $30,000 and have back seats that are generally only comfortable for children. A few have reasonably roomy rear seats, but that&rsquo;s the exception rather than the rule. Some sporty coupes are posers, meaning they are stylish but don&rsquo;t have a lot of guts. Others have enough muscle to match their sleek exterior and push the envelope toward sports cars. Either way, almost all of them get great fuel economy. Aside from the small rear seats and tricky entry and exit, sports coupes also tend to be expensive to insure and have poor rear visibility. They aren&rsquo;t for everyone, but do offer style and, in some cases substance, at a very affordable price point. You can find the following sporty coupes on display at the 2013 Chicago Auto Show or at the Vehicles on Display section of the auto show Web site.
