Courtesy of Jen Lancaster Bestselling Humor Author Jen Lancaster Comes to Richmond Jen Lancaster, author of 'Bitter is the New Black' and My Fair Lazy,' will be in Richmond on Wednesday night.  Posted: Monday, May 2, 2011 1:00 am Bestselling Humor Author Jen Lancaster Comes to Richmond Stacy Ruble Richmond.com Jen Lancaster , New York Times Bestselling Author of five humorous memoirs including " Bitter is the New Black " and " My Fair Lazy ," is coming to Richmond’s Fountain Bookstore May 4 during the tour for her first novel, "If You Were Here." Publisher’s Synopsis : If You Were Here follows Amish-zombie-teen- romance author Mia and her husband Mac (and their pets) through the alternately frustrating, exciting, terrifying-but always funny-process of buying and renovating their first home in the Chicago suburbs that John Hughes's movies made famous. Along their harrowing renovation journey, Mia and Mac get caught up in various wars with the homeowners' association, meet some less-than-friendly neighbors, and are joined by a hilarious cast of supporting characters, including a celebutard ex- landlady. As they struggle to adapt to their new surroundings- with Mac taking on the renovations himself- Mia and Mac will discover if their marriage is strong enough to survive months of DIY renovations. Excerpt here . ----- This will be Jen’s first visit to Richmond and Richmond.com wanted to take an opportunity to interview her about her new book, her transition from memoir to novel writing, and her upcoming visit. We are excited this book tour is bringing you to Richmond. What made you decide to include Richmond in your schedule this year? Every year I have done a contest where I ask people where I should come on tour, and Richmond is always in the top 15. My fans have a little bit of that southern sensibility. Richmond seems to get me. Last year there was a requested dress code. What should Richmonders wear this year? No dress code this year. I am a little bit at loose ends this year. Every year I have had a theme and this year is fiction, but Mac and Mia - their characters - are so similar to how Fletch [my husband] and I are, so, just wear what you would wear to see me. Up until now you have been writing memoirs. In fact, you had been working on a memoir and then started house hunting. What made you decide to take your house hunting experiences and write a novel instead? When we moved in [to our new house], I had a completely different book due. We had sold this group of three novels, but I still had another memoir due. I had spent an entire year working on this book about volunteering and waiting to have this big "a-ha" moment. My big a-ha was that charities are much better having me lend my name to them or writing them checks than me actually working for them. I was struggling with this book and we moved into our house and every day funny situations happened. So a month before that memoir was due I switched gears and said I want to write the novel now. A lot of things you’re going to read in this book are directly out of our real lives. Fans are going to have a good time figuring out what is and isn’t true. So your novel "If You Were Here" is based on your and your husband Fletch's experiences. Did you find it easier or more difficult to write a novel as compared to a memoir? Now that I’ve done both, I have to say I prefer novels, but the novel is still pretty new. The difference is there wasn’t that much dramatic happening with our house search and I thought this is not going to make a very good memoir. But with fiction I don’t have to live through unpleasant s**t. Do you know how nice that is? While I was writing this book we had painters here [at the new house]. They showed up every day, did a spectacular job, and came in on time and under budget. [Meanwhile] I am writing about these idiots falling through floors and toilets crashing through ceilings [in Mac and Mia’s house]. It was awesome! You’ve talked a little bit elsewhere about the kindle/nook/tablets changing publishing. What is your take on how they have changed the world of publishing, your personal take on them? You know, for the most part I think they are good. I have one. I love my Kindle. I use it all the time. It is annoying with my books. The footnote thing [that characterizes my memoirs and novel] is an annoyance, so either the technology needs to catch up or I’m going to have to start doing something different for Kindle book versus traditional books. But I think… I do hate what the Kindle has done to book stores, so I’m glad that places like Barnes and Noble have come out with their own version so they can still get the business. But I find that I buy a lot of books that maybe I wouldn’t have given a chance. You know, it’s $24 in the store but it is $9 on an electronic reader? I’m more likely to take a chance. So I am hoping it gets people to read more because people don’t always have a book with them but they almost always will have some kind of electronic device with them. Right and you’re more likely to be like "sure, why not, I’ll just go ahead and download that" kind of like you would if you were going shopping online versus being in a store. Yeah, exactly. The first time I had my Kindle at the beach and I had finished everything I had read and I thought here I am sitting at the ocean and I can just get a book right now. This is a brave new world. What are your thoughts on self-publishing? You know, well, I’m not a fan. I’m not a fan for a couple of reasons because I think it is very hard to get your message out there. That is changing. It’s not as bad as it was five years ago. This is something that… a model, that more people are going to. I think it’s better for more business-type books. I don’t think it’s a great way to publish novels right now. And memoirs. But the space is changing so far that this could be something that I could be very wrong about in the next couple of years. About your visit – you are here only one day. What are you hoping to do while you are in town? It depends on what my publisher has planned for me. Usually during the day I sleep, because often I don’t get more than three hours a night during tour. I’ll go to the event, get done around 10:30, go back to my room and eat dinner. I never get to do anything fun. Every time I go on book tour I’m like oh, this is a really great city; I’d like to come back here sometime when I’m not working. Is there is anything else you want Richmonders to know before they come and see you? Just Richmond, please be warm. [And for die-hard fans] no dress code this year. Every year I have had a [tour dress code] theme, but Mac and Mia’s characters are so similar to Fletch and me, just wear what you would to see me. And I’m excited to be in Richmond. Have people show up because you guys keep telling me to come there! Richmond.com scoop on RVA connection to Jen : The mother of Jen’s publicist, Craig Burke, lives here in Richmond.
