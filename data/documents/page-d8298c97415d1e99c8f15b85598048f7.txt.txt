WHY QCERTIFIED? There are certified cars and then there are QCertified cars. Whatâs the difference? Plenty! Let's start with this: 1. Reconditioning Every vehicle must meet or exceed exacting inspection and reconditioning standards in order to become â QCertified .â Each vehicle undergoes a 128-point inspection. And, only ASE Certified Technicians who have completed QCertified training may perform this service. 2. Quality Control To make sure that each QCertified vehicle is in strict compliance with our tough standards, a nationally known independent third party randomly evaluates QCertified dealerships â just to be sure. 3. Peace of Mind As part of the QCertified process, each vehicle is put through a comprehensive vehicle history evaluation from AutoCheck, by Experian Automotive. In addition, every QCertified vehicle owner receives a QUltimate Limited Powertrain Warranty to protect your vehicle. ...And More QCertified owners receive a one year membership to Road Americaâs Auto Assist program, providing roadside assistance, towing, emergency travel expense reimbursement, gas delivery, tire hazard protection and lockout benefits.
