The Accord Type-R has been relegated, and the B7 A4 Avant is now the primary daily. Please excuse me for posting a German car on Japanese Tuning Culture!

As such, I thought I&#8217;d put together a little gallery of my favorites!

It was half a day of Ali messing around in the passenger footwell whilst I helped where I could, but I&#8217;m very happy with the finished article.

I opted for an ARK Design Advanced Boost Controller, Rev Shift Timer, and Multi Function Dash.

In short, the performance increase was staggering; it&#8217;s like driving a different car.

This meant car geeks across the land, including myself, took their projects (read: moneypits ) out of hibernation to remind themselves of that weird love/hate relationship they share with their vehicles.

I plan to change that this year; the parts stockpile is growing, and I&#8217;ve got some plans to make sure the 200SX is driving exactly how I want it to by the end of the season. Today is the first day of spring, and the car is officially out of hibernation and back on the road.

The sun is out and competitive British drifting is about to start, with the British Drift Championship&#8217;s first round on the 22nd of April, and JDM Allstars first round on April 25th. To celebrate, here&#8217;s some photos I never published from JDM Allstars Wembley 2010.

Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t get an opportunity to get any good snaps of his car (why do I always neglect the car I arrive in?). Despite this, his FD is pretty much a big deal. Subtle on the outside, savage where it counts. Riding in cars like this often makes me think that I got enthusiastic about the wrong chassis! Anyway, I&#8217;ll be pushing Ryan to invest in some RPF1s, and hopefully there will be a full photoshoot on the cards ASAP.

This one was bigger and better than February&#8217;s, and the sun was blazing for what was a very enjoyable and chilled out static meet. Lots of BMWs, VWs, Nissans and other machinary in attendance.

I decided to check it out with a few of the Drifted.com guys. It was a great meet, showcasing both Japanese and European machinary. This meet definitely holds potential for the future, I can&#8217;t wait for the next one!

There were some insanely clean Hondas, and a few really nice VWs too.
