Artists introduce surprise, humor to Greenwood Avenue and central waterfront  By KOMO staff Published: Sep 6, 2012 at 6:00 AM PDT Last Updated: Sep 6, 2012 at 8:14 AM PDT Share this story Comments print email Story Photos Photos &raquo; Greenwood art 1 Greenwood art 2 Greenwood art 3 Greenwood art 4 Wander along Greenwood Avenue North and the Central Waterfront in Seattle and find Art Interruptions , a series of artworks on city sidewalks and in parks offering a brief interruption in the day with a moment of surprise, beauty or humor. Twelve artists have created temporary art installations on street and park infrastructure, furniture and trees. Depending on the type of artwork, most pieces are on view through Sept. 21. Greenwood Avenue North Projects (from North 67th to North 87th streets) A.K. &quot;Mimi&quot; Allin will walk along Greenwood Avenue North, between North 65th and North 85th streets, embracing telephone poles three to five times a week, two hours a day, during morning or evening rush hour, for the project Surrogate. Where there aren't telephone poles she will hug lampposts or signposts. After an &ldquo;appropriate amount of time&rdquo; expressing affection for each pole, Allin will compose a handwritten love letter and attach it to the pole. Barbara DePirro has installed a series of chrysalis sculptures clustered together in four trees at Phinney Center at 6532 Phinney Ave. N., Greenwood Library at 8016 Greenwood Ave. N., and The Fiber Gallery at 8212 Greenwood Ave. N. For chrysalis plastica, DePirro used recycled plastic product packaging, bags and banding to create hand-sculpted wire that form each chrysalis, ranging in size from 12 to 24 inches. Joanna Lepore created mini-gardens with recycled plastic bottles, drip irrigation and twine for Tightrope Gardens. The gardens contain all edible plants, vegetables, flowers and herbs that continue to grow on site in two areas&mdash;in Greenwood at7818 Greenwood Ave. N. and at Alaskan Way and Wall Street near the Central Waterfront. Chris Papa created a site-specific wood sculpture with salvaged wood from shipping pallets, produce crates, discarded furniture and other waste wood. The sculpture wraps around a mature street tree like a vine. The work is located on the southeast corner of North 85th Street and Greenwood Avenue North. Carolina Silva created Tree Houses&mdash;miniature reproductions of five select houses along Greenwood Avenue North hung in trees like birdhouses near the original homes. The tree houses are located between North 67th and North 80th streets. Central Waterfront Projects (Alaskan Way between Marion and Wall streets) Peter Bjordahl created Leave.Take, a series of 20 to 30 handmade bricks, each with a USB interface protruding from the surface. Stacked together and arranged on Pier 62/63, the artwork appear as a collection of bulky and heavy USB memory sticks. Passersby can plug into the bricks or take them home to realize they are fully functioning memory sticks. (Note: Due to the nature of the work, the piece is no longer at the location.) Mary Iverson created Flip&mdash;an animated mural on the Marion Street pedestrian bridge heading towards the Seattle ferry terminal. Twenty-nine illustrated panels describe a story of a container coming off a cargo ship at port. Jennifer and Allan Kempson created a series of birdhouses out of wood, metal, paint, found materials and mini-LED-display scroll signs. Mounted on light poles along the Pike Place hill climb adjacent to the Central Waterfront, Tweethouse captures the experience of urban wildlife with birdhouses that provide a network of homes for urban birds. The artwork doubles as a continuous feed of information to people on the web through Twitter and on the street through digital signage that relays the Twitter feed. The Twitter handle is @mktmockingbird. Ingrid Lahti created a site-specific, hanging installation with moving, reflective mirrors attached to a framework at Waterfront Park on the west side of Elliot Way. The design was inspired by images of galaxies taken by the Hubble telescope and the ferris wheel next to Waterfront Park. The final design is a 6-foot-high by 6-foot-wide image of rectangles within rectangles. The mirrors move in the breeze and reflect ambient light. As the mirrors create multiple reflections, the installation creates an illusion of three-dimensionality for visitors who are close to the work. Nickolus Meisel hung a banner with the text &quot;begin&quot; beneath the pedestrian bridge on Alaskan Way to First Avenue on the southern corner of Marion and Western avenues. The artwork offers the word to serve as a marking point for the beginning in time that you passed through the space. Ellen Sollod created a series of 32-inch-wide by 48-inch-high vinyl banners printed with photographs that encourage watching Elliott Bay. Precious Water: Baywatching is installed on the western fence on Piers 62/63. Brian Benfer created a series of vertical chalk rubbings on the curved staircases in Waterfront Park. The stair riser has color fields that change over time with weather conditions to create a new landscape on the horizontal sections of the staircase. ( Note: Due to the nature of the work, the piece is no longer visible ).  0 comments Get Livefyre FAQ Sign in   + Follow  Post comment      Link   Sort: Newest | Oldest  Send Feedback Powered by Livefyre  Most Popular  Your Photos YouNews      Last of the Golden Sunset Meadows       By seattlenatvmike Published: Aug 27, 2013 at 9:42 AM PDT Last Updated: Aug 27, 2013 at 9:42 AM PDT Had a chance to visit Rainier earlier in the month as the flowers were peaking.
