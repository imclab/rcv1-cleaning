On this page you'll find some tips for avoiding being scammed and other tips to follow as you are selling your car. PROTECTING YOURSELF AGAINST SCAMS AND FRAUD Only log-on to view or change your ad via a News Limited URL or address such as https://sell.carsguide.com.au/offer/doSelectReach.action?pillar=carsguide or https://privateads.carsguide.news.com.au/processLogon.do Never log on to your ad via an link contained within an email (even if the email appears to be from Carsguide.com.au If you receive an email asking you to click on a Carsguide.com.au link please call our customer representative on 1800 026 705 (Monday &ndash; Friday: 8.30am &ndash; 5.30pm) If your ad has been accessed and details of your ad changed by an unauthorised person immediately call our customer representatives on the number above. Never transfer money to a potential buyer. This could be a scam. For more consumer information on scams click through to our information page. When a potential buyer comes to inspect the vehicle make sure you Find out their contact details such as name, phone number and if possible adress or drivers licence number Ring the number you are given to check it is this person&rsquo;s real number Check with your insurer your insurance covers the person test driving your vehicle When you agree to a test drive always write down the driver&rsquo;s licence details Check the driver&rsquo;s insurance details as they may not be covered for test driving other vehicles Obtain something of value such as their current vehicles car keys Accompany test drive yourself If have you doubts about the person looking to buy your car don&rsquo;t rush into the test drive or sale If you take a cheque as payment ensure all the drivers licence details of the seller are on the back of the cheque. Before finalising exchange, request a second form of identification, preferably from a government agency such as a medicare or passport number or original utilities bill (ie Electricty, Water or gas bill) Remember, if you doubt the person offering to buy your vehicle is authentic don&rsquo;t be pushed into a sale, as you may regret it. ADVERTISING If you decide to sell your car yourself, the best ways of doing it are with a newspaper ad and on the internet. But no matter what method you choose, you'll get more attention if your advertisement is clear, concise and correct. Carsguide.com.au offers exceptional exposure , click through to find out more. WRITING THE AD Be precise in your description of your car, detailing the make and model, year of manufacture, engine and transmission details, major options and its general condition. Include odometer reading, and highlight if it is low for the age. Avoid abbreviations and jargon that might make it hard to understand for the reader. Keep the words to a minimum, 20 to 30 should be enough to get your message across. HOW MUCH SHOULD I ASK Putting an unrealistically high price in your ad will almost certainly mean you'll waste your weekends waiting for the phone to ring, but put too low a price in it will have you rushed off your feet by tyre kickers hoping for a bargain. In the weeks leading up to running your ad scan the classifieds and websites and get an idea of the prices being asked for similar makes and models as yours.

PREPARING FOR SALE To create a good impression on a potential buyer you need to prepare your car so it's looking its best when the buyer arrives. Consider having it detailed by a professional detailer. For a couple of hundred dollars you can have your car cleaned from top to bottom in a way that would take you a couple of weekends. If you opt to clean it yourself make sure you clean in all the hard to get at areas, like door openings, boot openings, engine bay. Never leave anything lying around the interior or boot making them look untidy in the eyes of the buyer. Loose items can rattle and bang around and create a poor impression on a test drive. If you're a smoker clean the ashtray and make sure the interior doesn't smell of cigarette smoke. There's no better way of putting a buyer off than to show them a car that smells of tobacco. If it does smell get a deodoriser and leave it in the car for a week or two before advertising it in the hope the smell will go away. Don't leave the deodoriser in the car when showing it to a potential buyer. Wash and polish the exterior including the wheels, windows and all chrome or stainless trim. Clean up any residue of polish after you're finished to avoid giving the impression you've just cleaned the car up to sell it. Consider having the engine oil changed a week or two before selling it so it looks nice and clean if the buyer pulls the dip stick. Doing it a week or two before will mean it won't look too fresh on the day. Make sure the windscreen washer reservoir and radiator are topped up to the marks so it looks like you have cared about your car. Take the time to inflate the tyres to the correct pressure. There's nothing worse than going on a test drive and being shaken and shimmied because the owner didn't set the tyre pressures. Have the car's service record on hand to show the potential buyer that you have had the car serviced regularly. It's another way of demonstrating you've looked after it. Also have the car's title on hand to show that you are the owner of the car you're selling. Consider investing in a vehicle history report. Checkitout.com.au will supply you with a full vehicle history check and certificate for around $30. Share this article (what is this?)
