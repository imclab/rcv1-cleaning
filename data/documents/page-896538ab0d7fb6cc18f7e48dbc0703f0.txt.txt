"MUSIC ON MAIN" is where literally hundreds of performers give it their all on three stages along the streets of downtown, rockin' and rollin' for four days at Fort Worth's largest music festival.  Check back in February when we announce our entertainment headliners for our 29th year! Sundance Square, University of Texas at Arlington and Bank of Texas are graciously sponsoring our three stages, bringing you some of the best entertainment from our own local community, as well as from across the country and around the world.  We're also very pleased to have the Dallas-Fort Worth Professional Musicians Union Trust Fund as a supporter of our daytime entertainment, providing direct funding for most of our daytime musician stipends.   The excitement is building along with our incredible entertainment lineup!
