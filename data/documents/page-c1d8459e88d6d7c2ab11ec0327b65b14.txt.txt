And nothing says #PrePartay like Smirnoff Ice on ice, an artisanal cheese flight someone thought would class it up a little, and getting your annoying friend to stop tweeting everything you guys do.      

Next time you're spending all night safety-pinning yourself into that dress or agonizing over which eyeshadow really projects your wild energy the best, get #StraightPrimpin with Smirnoff Ice and make your pre-game count.  Cheers, girl.
