This is something so horrible, so terrible that its rapid proliferation signals the likely end of intelligence on our planet. Two words: “Reality television” — with such priceless gems as “Dance Moms,” “Storage Wars,” “Cupcake Wars,” “Real Housewives of (wherever),” “America’s Top Chef/Model/Yodeler/Stoner/Whatever,” and so many more. Any visitors from another planet should, upon receiving a transmission of “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo,” feel they are doing our galaxy a favor by immediately vaporizing our planet. These shows put on for display some of the worst in human behavior. And an increasing number of Americans eat it up like so much candy (I know this is true, because I read it on the Internet). Five minutes of watching the horror known as “Jersey Shore” was sufficient for me to consider tearing out my eyeballs. The behavior of the cast, ranging from total selfishness and outright nastiness is at the same time appalling and rewarded with bigger ratings and more money for the cast and executives (who likely do not care a hoot about quality, as long as the shows make money). I sat through “Top Chef” (or whatever it is called) once. Sorry, Mr. Voltaggio, but I just cannot see the excitement in competing to create the best dessert in 10 minutes in which the only allowed ingredients are Jell-O, bread crumbs, a teaspoonful of Blue Bonnet and seven Tater Tots, then sitting through the post-loss interview with faux sadness and regret (“I cooked the Tots too long”). My wife has coerced me to sit through several episodes of the tragicomedy “Dance Moms,” in which semi-talented children are embarrassed by their selfish, domineering, step-on-everyone-to-get-to-the-top parents. I wonder how severe these children’s neuroses will be in the years to come. How shall we keep up with the Kardashians today? (At first, I thought that “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” was a show about jogging.) These three women (or however many there are) are famous for being famous and nothing else. The air they breathe is wasted. What lies ahead for us in the wonderful world of television? I anticipate fine entertainment such as “America’s Got Gas,” with host Larry the Cable Guy on a nationwide tour of county fairs. Perhaps future shows will feature competitions among refuse collectors (“Garbage Wars”) or the exciting life of the American couch potato in “American Idle.” Perhaps we’ll be able to crack open cans of Keystone Light in front of our big-screen televisions and drink in fine entertainment such as “Redneck Organ Donors,” “Bowling With The Stars,” “Bachelorettes of Dundalk,” “Tattooed Grannies” and “Project Potty Training.” Is there any hope for us? There are some decent shows on television — shows with plots, acting, character development, suspense and drama. Shows with real value. I would watch those, too. But not right now, for I must go — “Dance Moms” is coming on. It’s like a train wreck — one cannot look the other way.

Even the weather channel has reality crap ruining it.Thank god I have DVD's of movies I actually like. Pretty soon, I 'll dump satellite TV and comcast and just catch the local digital feeds for free. TV just isn't worth paying for any more. If only we could get our politicians who are supposed to be representing us to compel the broadcast cartels to offer ala-carte - pick and choose the channels we want to pay for - I wouldn't care so much about what the networks are promoting.

Well except maybe Duck Dynasty, there is no doubts that they are really red necks, but there may be one of them in congress next time. When I think about that possibility, I have to believe it will be an improvement over a lot of the ones in there now. Link soule1061 posted at 7:43 am on Thu, Aug 15, 2013. Posts: 323 The thing that kills me is that the people in the reality shows make A LOT of money. I read somewhere (on the internet) that the Duck Dynasty guys make $200-grand per episode. So yes, dance moms are catty because a lot of money is involved and it's a dog-eat-dog world. These shows are in the same intellectual range as professional wrestling. Back in the days before television, a pro wrestling show in town was guaranteed a full house. The advertising people know the potential and pay out money hand over fist to get next to the action. Me, I watch Ice Road Truckers. My wife likes the Louisiana gator-hunters. Go figure. Link kingesquivel posted at 3:06 am on Thu, Aug 15, 2013. Posts: 523 They aren't 'reality' shows. They are completely scripted. Even soap operas have more reality to them than these programs. That's why I'm addicted to the crime documentaries on the ID channel. I now how to commit the perfect murder from learning the mistakes of criminals so watch out dressthebird.
