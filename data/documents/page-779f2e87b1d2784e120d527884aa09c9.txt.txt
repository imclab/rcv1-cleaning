Yahoo! Autos receives Estimated Market Pricing from Automotive Information Center (AIC). Invoice Invoice, also commonly known as &quot;Dealer Invoice&quot;, is the price that the vehicle manufacturer charges a dealer to purchase a new vehicle from the manufacturer. The Invoice price includes the base price plus any equipment installed on the vehicle, and it also can include destination charges that the dealer incurs when purchasing the vehicle from the manufacturer. Dealers generally mark-up the invoice price and seek to sell the vehicle at its Manufacturer&#39;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). Manufacturer&#39;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) The Manufacturer&#39;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), also commonly known as the &quot;Sticker Price&quot;, &quot;List Price&quot;, or &quot;Window Price&quot;, is a price that the vehicle manufacturer suggests that the dealer sell the car for. The MSRP shown for a vehicle includes the base price plus any equipment installed on the vehicle, but excludes fees and taxes, transportation and destination charges that the dealer commonly includes in the final price. It is important to know that a dealer may choose to sell the vehicle above, below, or at the listed MSRP. The MSRP is only a &quot;suggested&quot; or recommended price that the vehicle manufacturer provides to the car dealer. Total Cost To Own The Total Cost to Own is an estimate of what it will cost you to own the vehicle over the next 5 years. More detailed Total Cost to Own information is provided at the yearly level (years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 after purchase) on Yahoo Autos&#39; trim and car comparison pages. The Total Cost to Own uses numerous data elements to calculate the typical price a consumer pays to own the vehicle in a specific market (such as Texas, California, Florida, etc). Included in the Total Cost To Own price are projected depreciation costs, fees and taxes, financing costs, fuel costs, insurance costs, maintenance costs, repair costs, and opportunity costs. The vehicle&#39;s market price, destination charge, and current rebates and incentives are factored into the Total Cost to Own price.  provided by Total Cost to Own $44,540 5-Year National Average View details Rebates and Financing No rebates available Calculate payments Engine 2.0L I4, 16 valves, 274 hp @ 6000 rpm 8 speed automatic transmission 17 mpg city / 27 mpg hwy Green Rating Learn more about the green rating User Reviews Model Rating Overall 4 stars 26 User Reviews Trim Rating Overall 5 stars Appearance 5 stars Comfort 4 stars Performance 5 stars Reliability 5 stars 2 Trim User Reviews Write a Review Trim User Review Pros: A REAL SPORTS CAR..
