If there's something out there that involves cars and we think our readers will think it's cool, we'll research it, interview the players involved, and write about it. Features tend to be some of the more entertaining pieces on Edmunds, intended more for the automotive lover like us than simply the car buyer. And a huge part of the world of the automobile involves its place in pop culture. We're talking movies, television, sports and all forms of entertainment. And since we're based in Los Angeles, the entertainment and car culture capital of the world, we are at ground zero for access to Hollywood's love of cars. From The Dukes of Hazzard to The Fast and the Furious , from Transformers to Smokey and the Bandit , if it's about cars and their place in our pop culture, we want to be there. We want to know what cars are featured in the movies, who's driving them, and how they're modified. Our writers and photographers go to the set and talk to the guys who built and modified them, who drove them in what stunts, and then look at how that impacts our culture at large. But Features are so much broader than show business. We'll take a look back at a classic supercar and write what it's like to drive it today. We'll send a writer out with a budget of $5,000 and ask for a list of cars he would buy with the money. We'll take a ride with Rhys Millen in his latest drift car and follow him as he tackles Pikes Peak. We'll talk to a designer at General Motors and get a firsthand look at the company's upcoming product portfolio. When an important new car is announced, we?ll take a thorough look at the details in a feature story. Features take you deep into the world of the automobile, in all the ways it affects our lives and our culture.
