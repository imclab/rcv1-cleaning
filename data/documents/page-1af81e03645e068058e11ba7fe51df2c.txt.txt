The culture in the office is amazing and there is plenty of room for advancement and growth. Cons &ndash; There are no negatives at this specific location. At the operation center with regular collections/sales jobs it appears to be a usual call center type of position. Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend &ndash; I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company DriveTime Automotive Group 2013-08-20 09:11 PDT Was this review helpful?

Promote people based on performance and recognize when you make a mistake if you promote the wrong person. Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend &ndash; I'm not optimistic about the outlook for this company DriveTime Automotive Group 2013-08-25 06:14 PDT Was this review helpful? Yes | No Add Employer Response Flag Review  Aug 14, 2013 Culture & Values Comp & Benefits Career Opportunities Work/Life Balance Senior Management Approves of CEO &ldquo; Its a good entry level career opportunity. &rdquo; Sales Advisor (Current Employee) Memphis, TN I have been working at DriveTime Automotive Group full-time for less than a year Pros &ndash; The pay is good considering you get base salary plus commission. It is a good entry level position, currently I'm a Sales Advisor which is a good learning role. Cons &ndash; If you dont hit budget its always something you didnt do right or something you could have done more of, and the calls can get tedious. I can make calls but after a while you get irritated. Advice to Senior Management &ndash; Stop being so critical, other than that its a cool place to work.

Cons &ndash; Hours, life balance, Car Detailing at time of your sale. Advice to Senior Management &ndash; Non. Great Company. DriveTime Automotive Group 2013-08-13 06:41 PDT Was this review helpful? Yes | No Add Employer Response Flag Review  Aug 21, 2013 Culture & Values Comp & Benefits Career Opportunities Work/Life Balance Senior Management &ldquo; Chew you up and spit you out &rdquo; Anonymous Employee (Former Employee) Phoenix, AZ I worked at DriveTime Automotive Group for more than 3 years Pros &ndash; Pay, good start up for someone that wants to build their resume. Cons &ndash; Culture is fake executives truly care less about you, it has even been heard executives state management won't leave on their own because they won't get paid and not capable to do so elsewhere though that is true for most frontline management there, assistant directors don't know how to manage people just numbers and they jump when told to, most managers only know how to manage process. Advice to Senior Management &ndash; Balance managing process with people and build a team with true business acumen. Do what you say you will do. No, I would not recommend this company to a friend DriveTime Automotive Group 2013-08-21 20:42 PDT Was this review helpful? Yes | No Add Employer Response Flag Review  Aug 5, 2013 Culture & Values Comp & Benefits Career Opportunities Work/Life Balance Senior Management Approves of CEO &ldquo; This is a decent company to work for - Not long term career potential for most. &rdquo; Loan Advisor (Former Employee) Fort Worth, TX I worked at DriveTime Automotive Group full-time for less than a year Pros &ndash; The pay is decent for call-center type of job, also there is a small monthly bonus potential. The monthly bonus is not as much as they make it out to be when you interview and depends on your performance and company performance. You can get your foot in door here and they have a great family culture among the DOPS Loan Advisors. Drivetime makes money by selling repaired low-value cars for much more than its value at high interest rates. This means they have plenty money to pay us all and is a great well known profit model = Drain money from poor/bad credit/dumb. Cons &ndash; Highly micromanaged, promotions based on who is liked, different standards for different employees, immature team supervisors, high turn over. Advice to Senior Management &ndash; Clean the above cons. No, I would not recommend this company to a friend DriveTime Automotive Group 2013-08-05 13:14 PDT Was this review helpful?

Yes | No Add Employer Response Flag Review  Jul 5, 2013 Culture & Values Comp & Benefits Career Opportunities Work/Life Balance Senior Management &ldquo; It can be a little micromanaged at times &rdquo; Anonymous Employee (Current Employee) I have been working at DriveTime Automotive Group Pros &ndash; The pay is decent you're salaried and commission.You can make at least $50,000 annually as a sales advisor. For the most part they usually hire people who are friendly so most of your teammates are good to get along with. Cons &ndash; At times it can feel like they are micromanaging you. Always over your shoulder and make you do extra tedious work when your main focus should be to sell Car. Even though they say they give you a WORK-LIFE balance. IT IS NOT! You can work all day pulling bells for multiple days and not even sell a car. The hours are very long and at times there's nothing to do so management begins micromanaging. Advice to Senior Management &ndash; Need a real work-life balance and have faith in your employees that they can and will get the job done without you being over their shoulder all the time.

Not many places to go &rdquo; Customer Service (Current Employee) I have been working at DriveTime Automotive Group full-time Pros &ndash; Pays decent Good starting Job Desires employees to grow with company Cons &ndash; Company is poor at developing quality leadership Requirements for promotions are inconsistent Company states they requires 4 yr degrees for most jobs and advancement but consistently promotes those who do not have a degree.

Yes | No Add Employer Response Flag Review  Jun 17, 2013 Culture & Values Comp & Benefits Career Opportunities Work/Life Balance Senior Management Approves of CEO &ldquo; Best employer I've worked for as a web developer / developer &rdquo; Distributed Applications Developer IV+ (Current Employee) Phoenix, AZ I have been working at DriveTime Automotive Group full-time for more than a year Pros &ndash; It seems like an extremely unlikely place to find it but this place is a fantastic place to be a software developer. I've worked here a year and have liked it so much that I've referred 2 developers. There are extremely fun, diverse, challenging projects built on some of the latest technologies here. Management listens, provides a great environment, anything you need to do your job well and greatly encourages your growth and promotes a really awesome culture. The vast majority of your time as a software developer is spent on new development. New technologies like KanBan, Azure, TypeScript, LESS, HTML5, .net 4.5, are all used and promoted. Also, there is an awesome group of very talented developers to collaborate and hang out with. I personally love working here and know a bunch of other developers that feel the same way. I've been working for over 10 years at 6 different businesses as a web developer and so far this is the best place to work out of all of them. Cons &ndash; Like with any software development shop, there is crunch time leading up to a release but that's normal and it is a very minor thing here. Advice to Senior Management &ndash; Keep up the great work, maybe look into expanding the office? Yes, I would recommend this company to a friend &ndash; I'm optimistic about the outlook for this company DriveTime Automotive Group 2013-06-17 22:50 PDT Was this review helpful?
