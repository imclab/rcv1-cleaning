INSURANCE.html  Things To Do Enter the Forum Paying Cash Whats your best Price When a consumer enters a dealership, an experienced professional salesperson with a high closing ratio will have the buyer qualified inside of a few minutes and will know the direction to pursue to close the deal. One of the key questions will be, "Are you financing?" The smart consumer will answer " HAVE NOT DECIDED " Answer the question in any of the following ways and the dealership is on it's way to a huge profit: 1 ) " I AM PAYING CASH "- A dealer profits from the lender when you finance but when you are paying cash, there is no gain. I cant recall a week going by selling cars that a buyer would not make the statement, "Paying cash. What's your best price?" That question always put a smile on my face as I realized that I was dealing with someone who didn't have a clue about how to buy a car. During the negotiation process, if the deal is tight showing little or no profit, the dealership will be more likely to accept if you are financing and they will be realizing a profit from the lender. 2 ) " YES, I WILL BE FINANCING !"- When shopping at a dealership and inquiring about available financing, you're considered a 'payment buyer' and you could end up with the short end of the stick. A dealer can, with some lenders, stretch the term to make monthly payments suit your budget. 3 ) WHAT'S YOUR INTEREST RATE ?"- You are telling the salesperson that the interest rate will come into play in your decision making. Some lenders will allow for a dealer to buy down the rate and if a point or two below average triggers your emotions, you are hooked. " example " the dealer pays $800. towards the Interest to the lender up front and the rate now drops 2 points. The $800. will be hidden in the negotiation stage, in other words had the Interest rate not been a factor to close the deal then there would be $800. more on the table that could be negotiated. " SUMMARY " Cash , If you are a cash buyer you are not being rude by saying " have not decided " , what you have accomplished is the dealership during negotiations may still realize a profit from financing and will allow a maximum discount into the negotiation process. Financing , If you tell the salesperson your budget is around $300. a month the whole process will shift into which vehicle will allow the longest term, price of vehicle now becomes secondary and the dealer will maximize. Interest Rate , you dont ask the dealer what their Interest rate is before having finalized a price, you have a rate in mind and it now comes time for dealer to match your expectations or you shop for your own financing. How To Surf the Internet to Get Valid Information Too much info can lead to total confusion.
