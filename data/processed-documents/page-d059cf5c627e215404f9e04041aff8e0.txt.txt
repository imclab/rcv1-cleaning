DeGeneres to host Oscars for second time View Photo Gallery  Oscar hosts through the years:Ellen DeGeneres will take on the high-profile role in 2014 of hosting the Academy Awards. Heres a look at other hosts.  By Emily Yahr , E-mail the writer So long, Seth MacFarlane. A year after the Family Guy creators crude brand of humor drew widespread criticism, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided to go with a much safer name to host next years Oscars telecast  daytime talk-show favorite Ellen DeGeneres .

You know what they say  the third times the charm. Known for her cheery demeanor and love of practical jokes, DeGeneres has a style that sharply contrasts with MacFarlanes often controversial frat-boy shtick. During this springs ceremony, MacFarlane described Django Unchained as the story of a man fighting to get back his woman, whos been subjected to unspeakable violence  or, as Chris Brown and Rihanna call it, a date movie. He also put on an elaborate chorus number about actresses in nude scenes, titled We Saw Your Boobs. DeGeneres also breaks the cycle of three years of headline-making host choices, starting with the unfortunate pairing in 2011 of James Franco and Anne Hathaway. The next year, producer Brett Ratner stepped down after a fury over homophobic comments he made, with his host, Eddie Murphy, abruptly quitting, as well. I think this year there really may have been a desire not to make an inflammatory choice and to let the news about the Oscars be the movies, said Mark Harris, author of Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood, who covers the Oscars for Grantland.com. Plus, having a female host could make up for the thrashing that MacFarlane received for his jokes about women in Hollywood (Lot of beautiful women here tonight. And for those of you who gave themselves the flu two weeks ago to get there, it paid off.), which many derided as misogynistic . I would really not underestimate the degree to which the academy took seriously the backlash to MacFarlane from women last year, Harris said. It wasnt just bloggers or journalists, it was a number of women in the industry who publicly said, I have a problem with the movie year being represented by this tone. ... [The academy] really listens to that kind of stuff. The MacFarlane-led broadcast didnt hurt for ratings despite (or perhaps because of) the controversy: About 40million people tuned in to that ceremony, in which Argo won best picture, making it the most-watched entertainment program in almost three years. When DeGeneres hosted, the same number watched The Departed take home the top prize. Given the viewers, some dont think the academy, or ABC, which broadcasts the show, would deem MacFarlane a failure. But the executives are probably eager for the comfortable but fun choice of DeGeneres, said Dave Karger, chief correspondent for Fandango, because the show can easily capitalize on her huge following on TV and Twitter. And the diversity factor is always crucial. I think the fact that you have an openly gay host this year, its really keeping with what is shaping up to be a very diverse list of potential nominees this year, said Karger, pointing to an unprecedented number of African American potential best actor nominees, including Forest Whitaker in  The Butler  and Michael B. Jordan in  Fruitvale Station . The Oscars, airing March 2 on ABC, will be produced for the second year in a row by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron (the minds behind NBCs Smash ), who will have to brainstorm new ways to make headlines with a much safer host. Its safe to say Ellen DeGeneres wont be singing, We Saw Your Boobs, Karger said.
