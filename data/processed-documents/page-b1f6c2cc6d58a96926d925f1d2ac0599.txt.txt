FTV 130 Introduction to Visual Storytelling, is an intense, handson production course in which students work with exploratory exercises, in assignments crafted to encourage risktaking and creativity. In FTV 140 Introduction to Film Aesthetics ( FTV 247 , History and Aesthetics of Digital Arts for Digital Arts majors), students begin the scholarly examination of films both as expressions of culture and models of rhetorical style that can then inform students own work. Together these classes form the gateway experience for every Dodge College student. From there, the curriculum continues to encourage creative and intellectual exploration throughout the undergraduate course of study. In every semester students are expected to develop both fluency in expression through the media arts (through courses in the major) and an understanding of the broader cultural context in which they participate (through courses in general education.) As students proceed into upperdivision courses, the degree paths become more distinct. More emphasis is put on the business of the business, whether the business is the film industry, film scholarship, public relations, advertising, television, or broadcast journalism.
