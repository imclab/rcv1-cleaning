We took it on a road comparison test next to the similar Infiniti G37 Coupe. By Larry Webster Email Comments Share  February 26, 2009 12:00 AM Text Size: A . A . A  Rosamond, Calif Hyundais new Genesis Coupe returns rear-wheel-drive handling dynamics to budget-minded enthusiasts. Yes, theres the new 2010 Ford Mustang in this class too, and in six-cylinder form it does undercut the Hyundai. But, starting at just $22,750, the two-door Coupe packs a modern 210-hp turbocharged four-cylinder engine, a six-speed manual transmission and a fully independent suspension. So in the low $20,000 range, theres not much that can match this Hyundai. But theres more. For another $3000, the Genesis coupe is available with a 306-hp V6. Fully optioned with a six-speed automatic transmission, sunroof, heated leather power seats and an iPod hookup, it costs just $31,750. So not only does the new Hyundai Genesis Coupe resemble the Infinitis G37 Coupe in designit packs much of the same equipment too. Hyundai has a habit of undercutting established players. This year, the automakers Genesis sedan earned the North American Car of the Year Award . To see if this upstart can in fact take on a more expensive luxury manufacturer, we rounded up both coupes for a romp through some of the twistiest roads in Southern California. Lets see how they stack up. The Specs These two cars are stunningly close when the technical specs are examined. Dimensionally, theyre within inches of each other. The Hyundai has a slightly bigger truck (10 cubic feet versus 7.4) and the Infiniti is slightly more roomy in the backseat. Under the hoods, the Infiniti appears to have a slight edge. Its 3.7-liter V6 employs variable valve timing and a lift system and cranks out 330 hp at 7000 rpm; 270 lb-ft at 5200 rpm. The car is rated at 18 mpg city and 26 mpg highway. A six-speed manual is standard, but since we wanted to test these cars in the configuration most people buy, we opted for the seven-speed automatic. The Genesis Coupe uses a 3.8-liter V6 that doesnt rev as high as the G37sit redlines at 6500 rpmbut it makes plenty of power, 306 hp at 6300 rpm and 266 lb-ft of torque at 4700 rpm. Hyundais V6 is also rated at exactly 18 mpg city and 26 on the highway. The automatic gearbox has six gears and, like the Infiniti, steering-wheel-mounted paddles for manual control. The Genesis Coupe is not simply a two-door version of Hyundais Genesis sedan. While they share a name and are built in the same factory, little of the structure and none of the sheet metal is shared. This is good because the Coupe isnt saddled with the sedans weight. Our V6 coupe weighed in at 3480 poundsless than the sedanand nearly 300 less than the Infiniti coupe. But because the two Hyundais are so different, it means that the sedans burly, optional 375-hp V8 wont fit in the coupe. We ordered both cars with the optional performance handling packages. In the Hyundai, the Track package adds 19-inch wheels with summer tires, Brembo brakes with larger rotors, sport-tuned suspension, aluminum pedals, a limited-slip differential and rear spoiler. At a mere $500, its nearly free. The Infinitis Sport package runs $1850 and includes much of the same equipmentlimited-slip diff, 19-inch wheels and tires, larger brakes, and slightly stiffer suspension. Obviously, one of the most significant differences between these two cars is the price. The Hyundai stickered at $31,750 and the G37S ran $45,045. To be fair, the Infiniti has several features not included in the Hyundai, such as the $2200 navigation system, and theres some clear evidence that Hyundai has saved some money. For example, the Hyundai has a manual tilting steering wheel that doesnt telescope. The Infinitis wheel adjusts both ways and is power operated. The Hyundais power seats have manual backrests that are power-operated in the G37. In addition, the overall finish of the materials was higher in the Infinitias one might expect. Its tough to perform an exact feature-to-feature comparison here. But even if we disregard the G37s navigation system, the Hyundai is still about 10 grand less expensive. The question is, does it feel that much less expensive from behind the wheel? The Drive With 280 fewer pounds, an extra cog in the transmission, and only slightly less horsepower, we expected the Hyundai to have an edge in the acceleration tests. The opposite proved true, and the Infiniti was two-tenths quicker to 60 mph (5.69 seconds versus 5.89) and faster through the quarter-mile (13.90 at 101.2 mph compared to 14.06 at 99.82 mph). But in the real world, away from our test gear, we noticed essentially no difference in acceleration between the two cars. Both offer crisp throttle response, an eager, snarly exhaust note, and more than enough power to get in trouble with the law. We ran the pair on the fantastic, sinewy, mountain roads around Ojai, California on the highway and through L.A.s city streets. Our test loop was well north of 300 milesneither car seemed to have the performance edge over the other. In fuel economy alone, the two were separated by less than one mpg, the Infiniti at 23 mpg and the Hyundai at 22.7 mpg. On the twisty roads, we could confidently dive into a corner in the Infiniti and the Hyundai would be filling our rearview mirror with a big chrome H. The same was true when we switched carsthe Infiniti would be tail-grabbing the Hyundais bumper. On the surface, these Coupes appeared to be equals in handling. But we noticed some subtleties that separate the two. For example, the Hyundais steering had a slight but perceptible dead spot on center. The Infinitis steering was a tad more fluid, and maybe a tick more directcall it an overall edge in refinement. But the G37s steering effort was on the high side compared to the Hyundai. And when we got the Hyundai buried deep into a tight bend, it felt every bit as natural as the Infiniti. The braking performance too was nearly identical. The Hyundai had a slight edge in our 60-to-0 mph braking test (112.44 feet versus 119.37) but both cars offered stellar braking feel. The brake pedals of both cars are firm and you can effortlessly brake right up to the threshold of the antilock system and gradually ease off at turn-in. These may be sports coupes but the Hyundai and Infiniti both have true sports car brakes. Neither one of these coupes is billed as an outright sports car. Yet they have tremendous handling prowess. They both felt eager, tossable and, thanks in part to the rear-drive layouts, less prone to the usual dominant understeer. But sports carlike handling usually comes with a price. And there certainly is a ride penalty paid for each one. Both cars felt a bit stiff over the big bumps and potholes. If you live where potholes are common, you may want to avoid anything called a sport package. There were areas were the Infiniti had an edge. In particular, the G37 had an extra layer of overall refinement. This is a hard area to quantify, but quite a few of the G37s details were simply better. The dash looked and felt like it was crafted of a more expensive material. The Infinitis shifter glides through its gate with Teflon-coated slickness. And the steering-wheel shift pedals are fit for a Ferrari. On the long ride home from our 300-plus-mile comparison test, we noticed the Infiniti is quieter and offers more comfortable seats for long-distance touring. The Bottom Line Do the Infinitis extra refinement and features warrant the extra dough? That depends. If the pricing spread were closereven by $5000we might give the edge to the Infiniti. But if judged purely on mechanical traits and test numbers, the extra $10,000 on the price tag of the Infiniti doesnt seem quite worth it. The Hyundai wins by a nose.
