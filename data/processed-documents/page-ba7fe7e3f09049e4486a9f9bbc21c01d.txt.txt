 Voices Home Selling a Car to CarMax My Experience Selling a Vehicle to CarMax Zanna B. , Yahoo! Contributor Network Jun 14, 2010 "Share your voice on Yahoo! websites. Start Here ." More: Carmax Flag Close Post a comment CarMax advertises itself with a no-haggle guarantee. Meaning whether you buy or sell your car at CarMax, there is no deviation from the offer they give you. They're in control when it comes to naming prices, but the friendly service and ease of the process may make CarMax a good option for you if you need to sell a car quickly. Appraising Your Car At CarMax : I found out quickly that it doesn't matter how clean or dirty your car is when they appraise it, or if there are a couple dings on the bumper (guilty!) ... CarMax is looking for structural damage, mileage, general condition of the interior/exterior and other sellable factors like how cold the a/c is and how well it runs. They then take that information and compare it to their database of how well cars similar to yours sell at auction or on the lot. This figure will definitely be different than if you did an internet estimate through Kelly Blue Book or Edmunds . If you need to get KBB or Edmunds pricing on your car, CarMax probably isn't going to give it to you. You're better off selling the vehicle yourself. Paying For Convenience : The CarMax appraisal only takes about 20-30 minutes depending on how busy the dealership is. I was helping my grandparents sell a car valued by Edmunds at about $4000, CarMax offered about $2500. Why the difference? Because customer demand for a Ford Focus isn't especially high, even with only 43,000 miles, good interior/exterior and super cold air conditioner. The offer CarMax gives you is good for 7 days. Deciding To Sell a Car To CarMax : Once you decide you'd like to accept the offer, you are told where to drive your car (usually over to the service area). You need to have on-hand the title to the car (if you own it), car registration and your photo ID (driver's license) . The CarMax representative will check the vehicle again, draw up the paperwork and then you'll start signing over the title. It takes about 20 minutes total once you get going. They will give you a draft check that you will need a bank account to deposit into in order to cash. You will not be able to just cash the check without depositing it into a bank account. I was told by the customer service folks there is no difference in appraisal value if you trade-in for a new car off their lot or if you are just there to sell your car to CarMax. All-in-all, selling to CarMax could be your best option if you don't want to deal with the hassle of selling a vehicle yourself. There's a danger involved with screening and test driving potential car-buyers from the internet. Published by Zanna B. Law student and journalist with experience producing documentaries and TV news.
