Add the first question. User Reviews The first hour is good...  2 February 2003 | by aramo1  (Ireland)  See all my reviews Based on R2 DVD 87 min. Gossip starts off well, an interesting premise, pretty people a suggestion of a good thriller to come. Alas somewhere around the 60 minute mark the script writer must have run out of pencils. The story takes a witless fantasy turn that left me feeling cheated. The so called alternate ending is just a longer and more unrealistic one. 5/10 catch it on TV  5 of 6 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?
