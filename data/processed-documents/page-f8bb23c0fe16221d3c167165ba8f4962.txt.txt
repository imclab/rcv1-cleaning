This is too late, probably for most people, and thats my fault. I view this situation as one big lie that I repeated a lot of times.Its not as if I said no and moved off it. While Ive lived through this process, I know the truth. The truth isnt what I said and now its gone.A cancer survivor who inspired millions, Armstrong said he did not believe he could have achieved what he did without breaking the rules due to the culture of drugs in cycling.Not in that generation. I didnt invent the culture, but I didnt try to stop the culture, he said.Its hard to talk about the culture. I dont want to accuse anyone else. Im here to acknowledge my mistakes.He said he never considered himself to be a cheat and thought he could get away with it until competition tests were introduced and testing procedures dramatically improved.I looked up the definition of a cheat to gain an advantage. I didnt view it that way. I viewed it as a level playing field, he said.Armstrongs admission came just months after the US Anti-Doping Agency released a detailed report describing him as the ringmaster of the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen.Tags: armstrong, oprah2013 Golden Globe Awards Winners  Posted in TV | Comments Off While not as prestigious as the upcoming Oscars, the Golden Globes Awards are often looked to as indications of likely winners for the following Academy Awards.

Reid is leaving the show and will not be in the next season. He is chairman and CEO of Epic Records and told Hollywood Access, I have decided that I will not return to The X Factor next year.

I love Simon. We have a great relationship, says Reid. We have fun together, we talk, we laugh, we do bad things, were friends.

The other current judges are Britney Spears and Demi Lovato.Australian Radio Station Donates $500k To Family Of Nurse In Royal Prank  Posted in News | Comments Off The Australian radio station that played the royal prank phone call that may have led to the death of the British nurse who put the call through has donated about $500,000 or around 320,000 British pounds to her family.2DayFM announced that it will donate all proceeds from its advertising profits for the rest of the year to Jacintha Saldanha in a fund set up for her 2 teenage children and husband.2DayFM has been under fire from all quarters after it pulled a prank to call Kate Middletons hospital room  with one of its DJs pretending to be Queen Elizabeth.
