 Automotive industry From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search The automotive industry is a term that covers a wide range of companies and organisations involved in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and selling of motor vehicles , towed vehicles , motorcycles and mopeds . It is one of the world's most important economic sectors by revenue . The term automotive industry usually does not include industries dedicated to the maintenance of automobiles following delivery to the end-user, such as repair shops and motor fuel filling stations . The term automotive was created from Greek autos (self), and Latin motivus (of motion) to represent any form of self-powered vehicle. This term was proposed by SAE member Elmer Sperry .

Jeffery automobile factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin, c.1916 Citroën assembly line in 1918 The automotive industry began in the 1890s with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the horseless carriage . For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929 before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons. [ 2 ] After World War II , the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. By producing 19.2 million units in 2012, China produced almost than twice the number of automobiles made in the U.S. second place with 10.3 million units, while Japan was in third place with 9.9 million units. [ 3 ] Safety [ edit source  | edit ] Main article: Automobile safety Safety is a state that implies to be protected from any risk, danger, damage or cause of injury. In the automotive industry, safety means that users, operators or manufacturers do not face any risk or danger coming from the motor vehicle or its spare parts. Safety for the automotives themselves implies that there is no risk of damage. Safety in the automotive industry is particularly important and therefore highly regulated. Automobiles and other motor vehicles have to comply with a certain number of norms and regulations, whether local or international, in order to be accepted on the market. The standard ISO 26262 [ 4 ] (_See also main article:_ ISO 26262 ) for instance is considered as one of the best practice framework for achieving automotive functional safety . [ 5 ] That is, to ensure that motored vehicles meet all requirements for safe manufacturing and operation for end-users. In case of safety issues, danger, product defect or faulty procedure during the manufacturing of the motor vehicle, the maker can request to return either a batch or the entire production run. This procedure is called product recall . Product recalls happen in every industry and can be production-related or stem from the raw material. Product and operation tests and inspections at different stages of the value chain are made to avoid these product recalls by ensuring end-user security and safety and compliance with the automotive industry requirements. However, the automotive industry is still particularly concerned about product recalls, [ 6 ] which cause considerable financial consequences. Economy [ edit source  | edit ] See also: Automotive industry by country Around the world, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road in 2007, consuming over 260 billion US gallons (980,000,000m 3 ) of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly. [ 7 ] The automobile is a primary mode of transportation for many developed economies. The Detroit branch of Boston Consulting Group predicts that, by 2014, one-third of world demand will be in the four BRIC markets (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Other potentially powerful automotive markets are Iran and Indonesia . [ 8 ] Emerging auto markets already buy more cars than established markets. According to a J.D. Power study, emerging markets accounted for 51 percent of the global light-vehicle sales in 2010. The study expects this trend to accelerate. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] World motor vehicle production [ edit source  | edit ] See also: List of countries by motor vehicle production For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929 before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the US automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons. [ 11 ] After WWII the U.S. issued 3/4 of world's auto production. In 1980 the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. By producing 18.4 million units in 2011, China produced more than twice the number of automobiles made by the U.S. in second place with 8.7 million units, while Japan was in third place with 8.4 million units.

The table is ranked by 2011 end of year production figures from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA) [ 27 ] for the parent group, and then alphabetically by marque. Joint ventures are not reflected in this table. Production figures of joint ventures are typically included in OICA rankings, which can become a source of controversy. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Note: This section does not include the selling of other products in a region example; CAT sells commercial vehicles in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Australia, and New Zealand. But sells its other products worldwide. If the table(markets) says that a brand is available in example North America, it doesn't include Territories controlled by countries on other continents.
