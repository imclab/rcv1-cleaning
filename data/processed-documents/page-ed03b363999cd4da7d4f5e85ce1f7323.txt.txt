Put it forward on the rack so you can stand on the door sill to pack it.Best used with large rolling duffels since there is only 36 x 36 of area. Pack it full, having a corner flapping will make noise, and wear a hole.

I feel so much safer driving knowing that I can actually see through my windows. My only complaint is that the pivot head moves a little too easily. It makes it a little tricky to clean in a quick smooth movement. Once you get it going though it's perfect.Also, seeing some of the other comments about it leaving things on the windshield...

However, I decided to give it a shot. When I was at store, I smelled the mats and they were just ok. When I installed them, which was easier than anything, I did not notice that strong rubber smell in my car. I am kind of smell or odor sensitive person. If you are really not that much sensitive, I would recommend you to buy these mats. However, please try smelling them before you make your final decision. The reason I take one star out is the front seat floor mats are symmetrically identical. So, they might not give you the exact fit. However, this is exactly the same in these sort of somewhat cheap floor mats.

At these times the Wagan is a God send, providing enough amps to turn over the engine after only 10 minutes. I especially appreciated having one during those bitterly cold days. No need to get out of the car and attach jumper cables between two cars. No need for another car to give you a jump. Just get into your car, wait ten minutes, start it up and you are on your way.

On pure function, will it blow up a tire, I have to give it a 5. Even if a car tire is likely to take a long time, it will get there.Seeing the review about it turning off and CB about turning the dial all the way (BTW - Thanks CB for that) I was a little worried it might not work well. I found that once it hits pressure and turns off, you need to turn it off and back on again with the power switch, this is a safety device so you don't accidently leave it on. You can use the trick CB suggested going to max pressure, the only thing is you really need to keep your eye in the pressure as that more or less defeats the over-inflation protection. Personally I would suggest putting it no more than 5 psi over the pressure you need and turn it off manually once you get the pressure you want, the issue with going to max pressure is if you go way over the right pressure for the tire there is a major risk of it or item being inflated exploding. Don't be fooled by its small size, pressure is pressure, if you have a tire blow and you are near it you can easily get hurt.Another tip -- as long as it is attached to whatever is being inflated, it will show the current pressure, if that is the same as the dial it will not turn on again, the safety will not allow as you are already at your dialed in pressure. To start it again just turn up the pressure dial or remove it from the thing you are inflating, cycle the power off then on and you are good to go.Last tip, I would go at least 2-5 psi over your real target pressure, you lose a little taking it off, then use a pressure guage to see where you are and let the air out yourself until it comes down to where you want it.All in all I am pretty happy with it, having AC and DC power is a real plus, I did not have 12VDC around my snowblower, just house power 120VAC.I also like how everything neatly packs away, my other little one has cords and the hose all over the place and no way to store it well. see less DIY Buyer Jan 27,11 add to compare Black  Decker Air Station Inflator compare Black  Decker Air Station Inflator  Advantage Truck Bed 4-Bike Rack quick info.

I use my car very rarely so having this tool is a necessity to jump start my vehicle if it has been sitting for quite some time. It will inflate your tires, can plug into your car lighter to charge while you're driving, and is very light weight.It has gauges to tell you how much battery power it has and when it needs to be recharged. It has 2 plug-ins to act as a battery for your laptop or other electrical equipment (great for camping) and 2 cigarette lighter outlets for other various pieces of technology you'd like to plug in.The only downfall is that you can't use the product right away when you receive it. It needs to be charged for 36 hours before it's first use...but after that it only needs to be charged every 3 months (plugs right into your wall at home). see less Spellweaver Nov 14,07 add to compare Wagan 400-Watt Power Dome compare Wagan 400-Watt Power Dome  PP3 Cover SUV/Pickup - Charcoal (Compact) quick info.

Woohoo!My package arrived in the mail today. The edges were frayed, the material felt flimsy, and the side pouches that are supposed to hold drinks don't hold bottles larger than 8 oz. For those of you who aren't math majors, that's a micro bottle. I'm pretty sure when I hit a bump, any bottle I place inside the pouches will either fall through the bottle or just jump out.Bottom line is that this is slightly less awful than throwing trash on the floor of my car.

Its a white 2011 Jeep fyi. Tried scraping off with my fingernail but wound not work and if it did would take hours. I Googled 'small rust spots on paint' and found this product. It works better than I would have thought. Spray the liquid on, rub it with the wax, and wipe off. It's amazing how dirty the car still was after washing it. It's hard work rubbing it in but worth it. Took an hour and some sweat. Cost [$] at Target and was actually the cheapest price I could find and was in stock. Won't let me paste a pic but trust me it works awesome! see less James Mar 30,13 5 of 5 stars overall Laborious, but highly effective.

I thought my paint job was screwed when my white car became pitted with these rust spots. A local body shop told me to try Meguiar's Clay Kit and I am very impressed with it's effectiveness. I could actually see the rust in the clay as it removed it from my car's paint. It did not harm my car in the slightest and after a post-clay waxing, my car looked brand new. I will be doing this on a yearly basis to ensure the life of the paint on all of my vehicles. see less Angela Mar 9,13 add to compare Meguiars Smooth Surface Clay Kit 16-oz. compare Meguiars Smooth Surface Clay Kit 16-oz.
