ART  ARCHITECTURE Early modernism in art, design, and architecture , which began at the turn of the century, continued through to 1940 and the war.In cities, Skyscrapers (first in 1870s) were erected and hundreds of architects competed for the work. The first successful design was the Woolworth Building in New York. In Chicago, the Wrigley building was designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst, and White while the Chicago Tribune Tower was designed by Howells and Hood. The Art Deco design was exemplified by the Chrysler and Empire State Building s (depression projects - the Empire State Building completed early 1931.) Frank Lloyd Wright was prolific during this period, designing homes in California and in Japan. The term Art Deco (1925-1950) is derived from the International Art Exposition in Paris in 1925. In the 20s and 30s art of that style was referred to as modern. Designers included Karl (Kem) Weber and Eliel Saarinen . Art movements included the modernist movement [ George Luks , Charles W. Hawthorne ], abstract expressionism [ Willem de Kooning ], surrealism, and dadaism [ Georgia O'Keeffe , Morgan Russell , Man Ray ], realism [ Thomas Hart Benton , Edward Hopper , Grant Wood , Leon Kroll ] and landscape [ Aldro Thompson Hibbard , N.C.

BOOKS  LITERATURE Following WWI (the war to end all wars), talented young authors, some expatriates in France, wrote about their feelings of disillusionment and alienation. A sense of rebellion developed and the victorian idea of decency was considered hypocritical. Writers began to write frankly about sexuality. Three important groups during this period were: The Algonquin Round Table , also called THE ROUND TABLE, informal group of American literary men and women who met daily for lunch on weekdays at a large round table in the Algonquin Hotel in New York City during the 1920s and '30s. Many of the best-known writers, journalists, and artists in New York City were in this group. Among them were Dorothy Parker , Alexander Woollcott (author of the quote "All the things I really like are immoral, illegal, or fattening", Heywood Broun , Robert Benchley , Robert Sherwood , George S. Kaufman , Franklin P. Adams , Marc Connelly , Harold Ross , Harpo Marx , and Russell Crouse.  Razors pain you; Rivers are damp; Acids stain you; And drugs cause cramp. Guns aren't lawful; Nooses give; Gas smells awful; You might as well live.

DuBois , Langston Hughes , Jean Toomer , and Alain Locke , who was considered the chief interpreter for the Harlem movement .  Southern gentle lady, Do not swoon. They've just hung a black man In the dark of the moon. They've hung a black man To the roadside tree In the dark of the moon For the world to see How Dixie protects Its white womanhood Southern gentle lady, Be good! Be good! Silhouette by Langston Hughes The Lost Generation, the self-exiled expatriates who lived and wrote in Paris between the wars. These writers, looking for freedom of thought and action, changed the face of modern writing. Realistic and rebellious, they wrote what they wanted and fought censorship for profanity and sexuality. They incorporated Freudian ideas into their characters and styles. This group included Ernest Hemingway , Gertrude Stein , John Dos Passos , Henry Miller, F. Scott Fitzgerald.
