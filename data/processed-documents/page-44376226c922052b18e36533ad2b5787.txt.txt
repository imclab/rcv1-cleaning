We have 4 of these car seats now. One for each kid in each car. They have updated the latch on the most recent one we bought and now I think this seat is perfect! These seats are going to last my kids until they no longer need boosters. Very cost effective! Also, we like the fact that they can be harnessed longer in this seat rather than just using a seat belt because the harness is safer. Ease of Installation Easy to install...but not as easy to get out. My husband has the seats in there so tight I can't get them out, but he can. Child's Comfort They love the cup holder and the cubby area where they can stash toys. **** This is car seat is wonderful Pros: 5 point harness to 65 pounds; Safety; Cup holder and toy storage; comfortable; easy to install Cons: heavy, bulky We love this car seat and the fact the straps go until 65 pounds and the seat will hold her until 100 pounds. I was a little gun shy about spending that much money on a car seat until I realized I will not have to buy another car seat or booster for my daughter. The car seat has a built in cup holder which has helped from having to find all the sippies. There are some little compartments on the handles of the seat the my daughter stuffs little toys in for while she is in the car. She likes that she is high enough that she can see out the windows and see everything going on. The car seat is heavy but worth the effort of moving because once it is in the car it is not going anywhere. The car seat is on the easier side to take apart and clean and I love that the straps come off so I can clean those too. ***** Love the Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 so much I bought 2. Pros: 5 point harness to 65 pounds; Safety; Comfortable; Cup holder and toy storage; easy to install; Affordable; Booster seat to 100 pounds and 57; Relatively inexpensive; grows with child; Converts to Booster; 65 lbs in the harness; Seat seems very comfy; 3 in 1 car seat system; can adjust level; Durable; Versatile; Comfortable cushions and straps; keeps tall kids harnessed; Easy to tighten and loosen straps Cons: heavy, bulky; doesn't recline quite far enough; Buckle gets stuck sometimes When my daughter outgrew her forward facing car seat at about 3 1/2, I knew she wasn't ready for a regular booster seat. I began the search for something that would allow her to stay in a harness until a higher weight. After many trips to the store and even buying one and returning it, I found the Graco Nautilus 3-in-1. I love the simplicity of it. It was relatively easy to assemble and it's easy to install. It is a little heavier than I expected, but I acutally like because when you decide to use it as a belt positioning booster, it doesn't move much or tip over when your child gets in and out, like some of the other boosters. I liked it so much for my daughter, I bought one for my son, even though he was still within the weight limits of his forward facing car seat. ****I really like this car seat! Pros: 3 in 1; Cup Holders; easy to buckle I purchased the Graco Nautilus 3 in 1 carseat for my (small) 3 year old a few month ago. We are really happy with it and plan to buy another one when our youngest gets a little older. The seat is really easy to use and I like the seatbelt buckle more than other carseats we've owned. It is easy to adjust the straps as well. My son seems to be very comfortable in the seat. He's fallen asleep several times. I did notice that his head seems to drop down when he falls asleep more than it did in his last car seat....but it clearly doesn't bother him and its not so bad that I feel worried for his safety. I am glad that we ended up choosing this seat. Plus, we shouldn't have to buy another seat for him since it will convert to a booster when he is big enough. **** Super safe  super comfortable, perfect! First and foremost, the safest car seat so far, yes its expensive but you get what you pay for, they is no other car seat that compares, especially with the side impact technology. Right now I feel that my son is safer in this car seat than any other, he use to use a Recaro before, also a great car seat. This car seat is comfortable, easy to get in and out of and the cup holders are a hit, he didn't have this in the Recaro. The fabric is wonderful, easy to clean and super cushiony. In booster mode is goes upto 120 lbs, I know my son will reach the height requirement before he reaches the 120lb capacity but I'm glad that it does harness upto 85 lbs. His sister in in the Britax Advocate and when she outgrows that she will use this. Yes its heavy but its a toddler, booster seat, its suppose to be heavy, I would be worried if it were light. ****I am VERY pleased! We purchased this product for our 3 year old son to use in our primary vehicle, and totally love it! We can go for long car rides and I know he is comfy and safe. I also like that he can reach his cup holder, and his head doesnt fall forward when sleeping. We are using the Britax Marathon for our 14 month old son and I plan on purchasing another Frontier as soon as he is big enough to face forward. :) **** Prefect fit Pros: Easy to transfer; Easy to install; Sturdy; Comfortable; Safe; LATCH System; Lightweight; Easy to Adjust; Easy to Clean Works great and helps my child to feel like he is a big kid. Hard for my son to buckle himself, but with time think he will be to do it. Allows him not to feel like a baby and more like a big kid. Bought one for both sets of grand parents for it is easy. They too love it *****I have bought this product again! Pros: Easy for my child to use; Safe; Easy To Install I bought this seat several years ago for my daughter. It was the best decision I ever made. We were involved in a triple roll over crash last year and while my husband and I were banged up our daughter came through without a scratch. We bought the same one again. Worth every penny you spend! We will be buying Britax seats for our second child who is coming soon! *****I will buy this item again Full review provided by CarSeatSuperstore.com Pros: Attractive Design; Easy To Assemble; Durable We use it to take our grandchildren to and from school and on trips. The booster seat he is able to get in and out by himself. I feel they are safer with a Britax. Posted by Lynda Tran at 9:12 AM No comments:  Email This BlogThis! Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Labels: Car Seats Booster  Best Car Seats for Babies & Toddlers - Car Seat Safety Toddlers When using an infant or convertible seat: Use your babys car seat rear-facing and semi-reclined no more than 45 degrees, so the babys head stays in contact with the seat and the babys airway stays open. Read the car seat instructions. Make sure the buckled harness straps that keep your baby properly positioned and secured in the car seat fit snuggly. Loose harness straps dont provide maximum protection. Be sure the harness is tight, so you cannot pinch extra webbing at the shoulder. Position the shoulder straps through the slots at or below your rear-facingbabys shoulders. Adjust the chest clip to armpit level. Use either the cars seat belt or LATCH system to lock the car seat into the car. Do not use both systems at the same time. Your car seat should not move more than one inch side to side or front to back. Grab the car seat at the safety belt path or LATCH path to test it. All car seats have an expiration date. Generally, it is six years, but contact the manufacturer of the seat to find out what the expiration date is for your specific seat. Never buy a used car seat if you do not know its full history and never use a car seat that has been in a crash. Do not use any products in the car seat that did not come from the manufacturer. Car seat fabrics meet strict fire safety codes. Add-on toys can injure your child in a crash. Find where the frontal airbags are in your vehicle by checking the owners manual. Never put a rear-facing car seat in front of an active airbag. Children are always safest in a back seat. Have your car seat checked by a currently certified child passenger safety technician to make sure it is properly installed. Never leave children alone in a car.

Pros: 5 point harness to 65 pounds; Safety; Comfortable; Cup holder and toy storage; easy to install; Affordable; Booster seat to 100 pounds and 57; Relatively inexpensive; grows with child; Converts to Booster; 65 lbs in the harness; Seat seems very comfy; 3 in 1 car seat system; can adjust level; Durable; Versatile; Comfortable cushions and straps; keeps tall kids harnessed; Easy to tighten and loosen straps Cons: heavy, bulky; doesn't recline quite far enough; Buckle gets stuck sometimes When my daughter outgrew her forward facing car seat at about 3 1/2, I knew she wasn't ready for a regular booster seat.

I liked it so much for my daughter, I bought one for my son, even though he was still within the weight limits of his forward facing car seat. I couldn't stand the twisted straps on his old seat. **** Best car seat for us Pros: 5 point harness to 65 pounds; Safety; Comfortable; Cup holder and toy storage; A brand I trust; excellent crash test rating; 65 lb 5 point harness; Safe for kids; 3 in 1 car seat system; 5 point harness goes to 65lbs; great colors; large weight limit Cons: Takes up a lot of room; Forward Facing Only; Misleading, not really for child under 2; isn't rear-facing; pricy; very heavy; Weight You can not put a price on the value of a child and their safety. We narrowed our search down to two seats for our 4 yr old that had high safety and parent reviews. Though our 4 yr old could be legally seated in a booster we chose to have a five point restraint seat for her safety, so she could sleep on long trips, and so that she could not be tempted to unbuckle herself to get a dropped toy. The cons were that the bottom strap/ buckle sits very close to her and is harder to buckle. The seat is very large and bulky and very difficult to install. We had to purchase another seat for the other car. **** very happy with this carseat Pros: 5 point harness to 65 pounds; Safety; comfortable; Cup holder and toy storage; Easy to install; Affordable Cons: I cant think of any!! After lots and lots of research I was torn on this and another car seat. The other was a bit more expensive than I wanted to spend and when I found this Graco on sale that is when I made up my mind. I am glad I did cause we love it. My daughter always falls asleep in the car and doesnt slouch forward like other reviews say. I also have a small backseat and dont find this too bulky at all. My daughter loves the compartments in armrests, she keeps snack in there and easy to reach :). It took her a while to be able to reach the cupholder but really before she could reach it I dont think she understood thats where cup goes. I love it and would buy again! **** awesome booster seat very nice booster seat. much more cushiony than prior models. **** Easy to install-Great seat My son loves his Sponge Bob seat. Prior to owning this seat I had to struggle with my son to get him in a car seat. Now he gladly rides with his Sponge Bob seat. My son is just shy of his 3rd birthday and weighs, 29lbs. **** Loving my Maxi-Cosi Pros: Fits great; Son loves the cup holder; Sturdy This car seat is great for my 1 1/2 yr old and my 4 yr old niece. I wish I would of had it from the time my son was born. I feel he's very well protected w/all the padding. It fits great in my GMC Accadia. Sturdy well made product that I will be sure to tell my friends about. **** Great carseat - better than Britax *This is our main carseat after replacing the Graco Snugride that we used from newborn - 10 months. *Very sturdy, high quality materials *Easy to install and adjust *Great fit for my 11 month old, looks comfortable *Not sure if it would work for smaller infants **** This is an exceptionally safe carseat Pros: Exceptionally safe; Reasonable to install; Comfortable for child Cons: Don't need cup holder This is a wonderful carseat, worth the investment. It's very well padded, especially on the side of the head -- I really like this feature, I haven't seen another carseat that protects our 1-year old's head so well. It's a very large seat, although since the base is recessed a bit we were still able to fit our sons' booster seats on each side, even in our narrow Forrester. Installation was not a problem.
