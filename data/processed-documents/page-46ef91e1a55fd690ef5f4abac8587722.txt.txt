Martin actually purchased a stock Muntz Jet in 1952, but sent it to Bailon for a new look. Bailon took the design and added a unique front end that included a new grille, air scoop and protruding fenders. The rear end continued the theme with prominent fenders finishing with Mercury taillights. It was painted two tone black and white with unique chrome accents. In this configuration it was featured in Motor Life magazine. In the 1990s, the car was discovered and restored by Frank Opalka and Lou Natenshon. Hemmings Classic Car followed the restoration for their December 2006 article and it was subsequently debuted at the 2006 Amelia Island Concours dâElegance. Later it was shown at the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours. It was sold by Bonhams at their 2009 Exceptional Motorcars and Automobilia Auction at the Quail Lodge Resort. They described the car as "With a few hundred miles on the odometer post restoration this unique automobile presents beautifully today. Standing as a great testament to three unique men their fields, Muntz, Martin and Bailon the car will always be a show stopper and talking point wherever it goes, even at among other Muntzâs for which there is a registry and gather biennially."
