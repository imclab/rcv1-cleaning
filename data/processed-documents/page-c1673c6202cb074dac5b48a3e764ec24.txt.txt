G  Masta Ace 3:25 $0.99 View In iTunes 19 Songs  iTunes Review Two rap veterans whose pedigrees reach back to the golden era, Edo G and Masta Ace are no strangers to fans of classic hip-hop. Boston's Edo found early success with Da Bulldogs, most notably with the positive single "Be a Father to Your Child," while Ace came up with New York's legendary Juice Crew and is known mostly for his epic single "Born To Roll" and a series of excellent concept albums. Though neither are household names, both have stayed busy over the course of two decades, consistently releasing quality material, mentoring new talent, and touring internationally. They join forces on Arts & Entertainment , crafting smart, witty, and thought-provoking rap music reflecting their deep experience in the game. Songs address the interchangeable nature of today's "hot" MCs ("Little Young"), reminisces on the way things used to be ("Reminds Me"), and life as an artist on the road ("Round and Round"). Limited but top-notch guest verses come from Large Pro, Pos, and KRS-One, while solid boom-bap production is provided by DJ Spinna, M-Phazes, and Double-O, among others.

Biography Born: December 4, 1966 in Brooklyn, NY Genre: Hip-Hop/Rap Years Active: '70s, '80s, '90s, '00s, '10s With an impressive resume in rap that includes membership in the legendary Juice Crew (along with Marley Marl, MC Shan, Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie, Roxanne Shante, and Craig G) and a verse on the 1988 classic posse cut "The Symphony," Brooklyn's Masta Ace is truly an underappreciated rap veteran and underground luminary. Two years after "The Symphony," Ace released his debut album Take a Look Around on rap's version of the Motown label, Cold Chillin' Records. While not a huge commercial success the...
