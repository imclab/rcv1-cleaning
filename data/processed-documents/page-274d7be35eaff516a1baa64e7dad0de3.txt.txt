Yes  Evenflo Featherlite 400 Travel System in Tangerine   Today  $181.09  it's just ok See All 4 Reviews Write a Review  Aug 4, 2013     tkitelinger    fromRochester, MN,  Rating: 4.0 The sunshade on the car seat and stroller are very cheaply made. The lack of quality in the cup holder is ridiculous. It's not really worth the money. The latch on the back of the car seat literally sticks to the base making it very hard to get out. It is made of cheap plastic as well and that makes me question the safety. i love the color combo, because you rarely see a yellow carseat. I also love the 5 point harness in the stroller, gives me peace of mind to turn my back for a split second. I give it 4 stars only because i rarely go out and use the car seat. I really do love the stroller though. How accurate was the sizing? very Please tell us about the quality of the product. the quality is fairly good. i love the swivel wheels and the adjustable handle on the stroller. Was the product free of any manufacturer defects? yes Would you recommend this to a friend?
