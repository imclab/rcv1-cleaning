Cruising along a country road on a sunny morning smelling the fresh grass, hearing the buzz of dragonflies and feeling the wind whip your hair is a pleasure that makes life worth living. Think Ferris Buellerâs Day Off . Think Thelma and Louise. Think about letting your adventurous spirit off the leash: Freedom. Think of all the fun times that can be had with rooflessness. Try driving a winding coastal road when the sky is deep blue: sea views are grand and salt spray is utterly invigorating. All the glamour of the 60s can be relived as you sweep around the bends. Add a gorgeous silk scarf and big sunglasses for the epitome of elegant open-top driving . Or, plan a short tour of the Lake District. The gentle winding roads and beautiful scenery are best enjoyed on lazy summer afternoons with the top down, listening to cool jazz. Stop for a picnic somewhere. Drive back at dusk, feeling and breathing the twilit world around you. Pull up at a country pub. Your loved one would need a heart of stone to resist such romance. Having a convertible car rental brings all of your dreams to life making your holiday better. Sixt wants to make sure everything goes perfect on your Holiday offering great convertibles at low rates .
