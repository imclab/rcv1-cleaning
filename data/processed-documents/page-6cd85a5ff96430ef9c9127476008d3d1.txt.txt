Extended, manufacturer-backed warranty coverage is the most financially valuable component of most CPO programs. In addition to a comprehensive vehicle inspection and extended warranty, CPO program benefits may include services such as roadside assistance and trip interruption insurance. Some CPO programs have a warranty deductible that amounts to a per-visit service charge for warranty work. For programs with a $50 deductible, warranty-covered repair work of $1000 would require $50 out of pocket. Many buyers say the CPO vehicle inspection is their top reason for choosing a CPO vehicle, citing added peace of mind. However, the actual number of items inspected is among the least important elements when comparing programs. advertisement  Search: Popular Topics Best Cars Car Classifieds Best Resale Value Awards 5-Year Cost-to-Own Center New Cars for 2014 Car Reviews & News Car Reviews Car Videos 2013 NY Auto Show Car News Car Infographics Help FAQ Site Map Find a New Car What's My Car Worth KBB SM Mobile Company About Us Contact Us Careers Corporate Information Industry Relations Advertising Media Center Linking Policy Business Solutions Follow KBB Facebook Twitter Google+ YouTube LinkedIn RSS Mobile Apps iPhone  Android Windows  Â© 1995-2013 Kelley Blue Book Co.  , Inc.
