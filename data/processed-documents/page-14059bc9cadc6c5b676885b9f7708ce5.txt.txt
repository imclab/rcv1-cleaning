 Shop The Amazon Warehouse for Automotive Deals and Discounts Cars For Sale This subject is something I know about inside and out. When I see cars for sale I see dollar signs. Anyone can make money with cars. The trick is to make the maximum amount per deal. This of course starts with the most basic sale principal of all time. Buy low and sell high. Yes this is easier said then done. I know people that have turned this into an art form. I wrote an article about my mentor and his unique used car business . I enjoyed a unique perspective that helped me learn from his mistakes and his success. I also learned from others. I am currently writing a book on cars for sale focusing on the buying low part. This book will take some time but I wanted to share some tips with you Today. Lets start with the product since the success of any business is directly related to the quality of the product. When first getting started only buy desirable cars. A good example, the 99 Infiniti Q45 above. It only comes 1 way (Loaded). Buyers will over look high mileage and many other things to wrap themselves in luxury! But you have to get the car cheap. How I started buying low was the mass low-ball offer on private cars for sale. A car buying trick I learned from a late night infomercial real-estate guru. Interesting sidebar: Many rich and famous people built their success on the back of buying and selling cars because you have to start somewhere. Best Time to Buy a Used Car Unlike real estate people with private cars for sale are almost always motivated sellers. Your job is to find out just how motivated they are. You know from your own experience, when you have cars for sale, you always want to get rid of that old car fast. People want to move on and that old car sitting around stops this from happening. You can use this to your advantage by being patient and realizing the seller needs you. However, to maximize this advantage you will need cash in hand. The power of a cash now offer can make sellers jump at the stack of bills and forget the original asking price. The mass low-ball offer helps you find the most motivated of these automobile sellers. It works like this; you go through the local car classifieds and look at model verses price. You then pick out the most popular models loaded with options (selling features) at the lowest prices. Circle all the good ads and build up a big list. If you need help on determining what a good price for a specific model car or truck is you can look up unlimited book values for free at Kelly Blue Book Bookmark or share this buying cars for sale resource page with a friend. Come back to use all the valuable tools on this website. Browse through Mark's Certifications and resume on Google+ . After purifying the list make the calls and go see the vehicles. You want to make sure the car "has eye". To turn a profit selling cars the inventory must have extreme curb appeal. "Eye" refers to the pleasant feeling someone gets deep inside when they're looking at something that brings an involuntary positive emotional response generating the words "I want". Luxury Infiniti, Acura, Lexus and sporty automobiles even with high miles sell much easier for this reason. Then make the insulting low ball offers. Thousands below the asking price. You must be firm and direct. Most people will say no way. Leave them your name and number and tell them to call you if they get stuck and need the money. You'll be surprised at how many calls you will get. Just do this over and over until you find the ultimate deal. Don't hesitate on walking away from a deal or making a counter offer even lower to cover any auto repair costs. Before the money changes hands check the vehicle out thoroughly. More on the subject on my how to buy used cars page. See how to check a vehicle with a used car inspection guide . Make Money Selling Cars Its time to repair the little tings like loose trim and broken taillights or any other small dollar repairs that attract attention. Then detail the car to the hilt. Do it yourself or spend money on it you can't go wrong with this decision. Either way this is the step that brings the dollars. It is also the big mistake that your seller has most likely made by not performing a full head to toe detailing.
