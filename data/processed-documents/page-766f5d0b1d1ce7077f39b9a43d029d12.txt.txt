For more information, check out the book below... eBay Motors the Smart Way: Selling and Buying Cars, Trucks, Motorcycles, Boats, Parts, Accessories, and Much More on the Web's #1 Auction Site In 2002, 300,000 vehicles with a total value of $3 billion were sold -- on one Web site.

From Mazerati to MoPed, Acura to Zamboni, if it runs on a motor, it'll take off on eBay! Customer Review: It got me the exact car I wanted. Without reading this book, I never would have thought to contact the seller and make an offer that would end the auction immediately. As a result, I was able to get the exact car I wanted, and the seller got his cash the next day, without having to worry about possibly flaky bidders. Win-win. That bit of advice - by itself - was worth five stars. But there's other good stuff in the book too.

I know what a waterpump is but could not change one if I had to. I know a muffler bearing is not a real part, and can change my own oil and perform routine maintenance items. I am a full blown motorhead and do all my own work on my vehicles.
