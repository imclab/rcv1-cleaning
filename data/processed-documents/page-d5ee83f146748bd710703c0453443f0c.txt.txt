He writes a nationally syndicated op-edcolumn and frequently appears on television and radio. He is afive-time Emmy nominee and recipient of seven consecutivenominations for the American Comedy Awards Stand Up of the Year.The New York Times called him  “quite possibly the best politicalsatirist working in the country today.” A prolific writer, he professes little need for material, havingit regularly delivered at 7 every morning in the five newspapers hereads daily. Durst said he is pleased by the amount of news he hasto work with lately, including “providing democracy to Libya bytaking it away from Wisconsin,” and mocking Sarah Palin for beingin Jerusalem at the Wailing Wall because “whaling is big inAlaska.” Durst’s comedy transcends party ties, having performed at eventshonoring former presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush aswell as at mayors and governors conferences. Durst heads for Augusta, Ga. the morning following his OperaHouse appearance to cover the Masters  golf tournament and writematerial for its website. “While I will be performing at the Opera House, I can promise Iwill not sing any arias,” he said. Durst also has been attemptingto move his work out of comedy clubs to more “theatrical”audiences, because: “usually they’re not drunk, they show up thereon purpose and they came to listen to the words.” View (0) Comments No Comments Posted.
