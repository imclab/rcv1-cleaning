I love my house, my garage, the lack of traffic, and the general relaxed nature here, but there are plenty of things I miss about living in Southern California. Being able to visit Cars  Coffee regularly is one of  them. It had been more than six months since my last visit to CC, so during my visit to Orange County over the weekend I made it a point to drop by the Mazda HQ in Irvine to catch up on the famous weekly car meet. Nothing had changed since my last visit to Cars  Coffee, and thats a good thing. It was still the same eclectic gathering of automobiles from every era and from every part of the world. Cars  Coffee is everything thats great about Southern California car culture squished into a couple hours every Saturday morning. As I walked over from the spectator parking area, I immediately noticed the vast number of Porsches that had come out to this weeks event. There tons of them at every CC, but this week there was even more than usual. It turns out the Porsche was the featured brand for this meet, and the southern corner of the lot was jammed full of 911s and other Porsche models. Among the standouts in the Porsche group was this 993 Carerra RS in all of its badass 1990s glory.  Just one of many mouth watering Porsches that had come out. Of course the Porsche section was just one small part of the whole event. The great thing about Cars  Coffee is that you could go every week and see different machines each time. Sure, come cars are regulars but you really never know whats gonna show up. Look in one direction and youll see a 68 Camaro that looks like a lifesize Hot Wheel. Look in another direction and youll see an understated Nissan Z33 with an intercooler tucked in the front bumper. There are even off road vehicles, like this jacked up Land Cruiser. No matter what sort of automobiles strike your fancy, there will be something to like at Cars and Coffee. If your tastes are as diverse as mine, it will be pure overload. One of my personal highlights from Saturdays event was this Sunbeam Tiger. An absolutely immaculate machine both outside and beneath the hood. Hey, who needs a Cobra? The great thing about Cars  Coffee is that its open to anything. Youll see million dollar exotics parked a few feet away from grassroots projects like this E30 sedan. Sometimes the low budget cars get just as much attention as the high dollar machinery. Few cars better symbolize the high point of Pontiacs history than the 1962 Grand Prix. Wide, stylish, and powerful. Sitting just a couple spaces away was the equally beautiful face of the E30 M3. Such is the variety that is Cars and Coffee. My last visit to Cars in Coffee in December of last year was actually the first time I saw the production version of the Scion FR-S in person. Now the FR-S and its Subaru BRZ cousin are on their way to becoming CC regulars. Another cars thats starting to pop up on the streets now is the Fiat 500 Abarth. Its so great to see such a solid selection of affordable and fun new cars hitting the US market. Heres a standard Fiat 500 looking tough with a drop and a set of Rotiform NUEs. If youve ever been to Cars and Coffee, Im sure you know the guy that comes out to serenade everyone with smooth jazz music from his car stereo. Stay classy. Being in Orange County, Cal Look VWs are found regularly at Cars  Coffee. Lovely little ragtop here. Sometimes you just want to cruise around in a vintage land yacht like this Caddy. Its big, slow, and gets terrible gas mileage, but who cares? Heading out for a little post-Cars  Coffee drive it seems? The unmistakeable lines of the Ford GT40, or at least a convincing replica of one When it comes to a meet like Cars  Coffee, you can choose to walk around the lot or you can simply claim a spot to sit and watch the cars roll in and out. Those of you who live in places where the Skyline GT-R was sold probably wouldnt understand the the excitement that occurs when a GT-R shows up at a car meet in the US  even a bone stock example like this R33. One of my somewhat realistic automotive fantasies is to pick an old Benz like this, drive it until it blows up and then do some sort of crazy swap. LS7? 2JZ? Who knows? Given its mild climate year round, there are few places on earth better for Miata ownership than Southern California. JDM fans will surely recognize an Infiniti M30, but I have a feeling many of the attendees at Cars  Coffee were wondering whats going on with this old, boxy Japanese machine. Then they glance at the RB25DET and under the hood and the discussions really start to get interesting This Mk1 Escort is an extremely rare vehicle to see in the United States. Im not sure exactly how many of these cars have made their way to the US, but the number has got to be low. Heres a Fox Body Saleen Mustang looking as good as new. Im curious to see what will happen to the values of cars like this over the coming years. Will these specialty cars from the 80s and 90s ever be worth the same as their counterparts from the 60s and 70s? This Honda S800 Coupe was originally purchased by a serviceman in Okinawa and he brought it back with him when he returned to the US. He also owned a Boss 302 Mustang and painted the Honda to match, complete with hockey stick stripes and all. The current owner purchased the car five years ago and got it running again. As of now though, the exterior remains unrestored. With that Ill go ahead and wrap up this post, but Ill return tomorrow with more of my findings from Saturdays edition of Cars  Coffee.

I'd never seen that Escort betore. Yep, I caught the Skyline as well, there's a photo of it coming up in the second post. share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  Robert   Leo CNCpics  Hey guys, thanks for the kind words about the Escort. It actually has a 250 HP Cosworth Duratec. Same motor as the Caterham CSR 260. I was going to pop the hood, but an English Ford purist once had a coronary thrombosis when he saw the swap, so I tend to play it low key now... ;-) Speedhunters (and CNC Pics) is the business, keep up the good work!  share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  Leo CNCpics 5 pts Damn, I knew it was one of those 4-cylinder motors just wasn't sure which one. I was going to ask you to pop the hood so I could take a quick shot but you seemed to be in a hurry to leave when I saw you. Oh and thanks for the compliment. :) share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  Robert   Leo CNCpics  Cool, I'll pop the hood next time before I slip away into the safety of the anonymous crowd... I'll just have to create a diversion when I leave so I can lower the hood and sneak away before someone blows a fuse for defiling one of the UK's finest... ;-) share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  Leo CNCpics 5 pts Robert I would like to take a bunch of pics of your car and feature them on my site. Would you be up for that? If so can you shoot me an email to leo@cncpics.com   Thanks :)Mike...you guys should feature his car too!

He was booking it. I'm pretty sure it was running E85. share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  zz   D1RGE EXE  Thats a Can-Am Car. Furious beasts of the late 60's and early 70's share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  KiwiMotoring 28 pts   D1RGE EXE  There's a rear-end shot of the same car on a previous Cars and Coffee post here: http://www.speedhunters.com/2011/07/event_gt_gt_cars_amp_coffee_7_9_11_pt_2/ share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  Brandon Motteram 15 pts I wish there was a desktop of the GT40 replica. That was a nice picture. share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  SloMo 7 pts How does that GT-R have cali plates? Its not legal is it? share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  NobodyFromOppo 6 pts   SloMo  You can import R33's but it takes a lot of work and money.  http://www.nicoclub.com/archives/the-facts-about-nissan-skyline-importation-into-the-united-states-1.html share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  Spaghetti 16 pts   NobodyFromOppo     Why are they illegal there? I thought the US was super easy to get anything registered! share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  NobodyFromOppo 6 pts   Spaghetti  It has to do with crash test and emissions regulations. I think we have stricter crash tests and the EPA doesn't recognize foreign emissions tests, so to import, you need to pay for crash tests and emissions tests. share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  Mike Garrett 249 pts   Spaghetti Quite the opposite the actually :( share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  CP9A Will 8 pts   Spaghetti It's not super easy but it's do-able. I live in New Jersey and own an Evo 6. share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  Spaghetti 16 pts   Mike Garrett So a car like "INTHE6S" the drag Corvette or the van in the other C thread with a roof chop, no roof panelling and a mid mounted and blown V8 can be registered, but an R33 GTR can't.....odd!!! share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  Mike Garrett 249 pts   Spaghetti Yeah once a car is titled it's pretty much fair game, and in California pre 1975 vehicles like the van can be modified in any way you please. It's getting imported vehicles legally titled that's the tough part... share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  Spaghetti 16 pts   Mike Garrett That's awesome, so rules are very relaxed for old school then. Pity it's not like that here! Thanks for the info! share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  EricSeanDelaney 58 pts One of the main reasons I will be moving to SoCal as soon as I can. share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  ding0tr0n what the f*** is in the background of the caddy picture? share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  zz Can-Am car.

Pretty crazy! share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like  SeanStott 11 pts C would be cool if 90% of the cars weren't gallardos, GT-Rs, corvettes, and mustangs.   share flag spam offensive disagree off topic Like   Official Suppliers  Speedhunters Team Executive Producer: Rod Chong Digital Product Director: Rob Bullough Business Development Director: Andy Barnes Editorial Manager: Suzy Wallace Production Manager: Annika Goksu Community Manager: Paddy McGrath Design Director: Jon Sibal Senior Editor Europe: Jonathan Moore Senior Editor Japan: Dino Dalle Carbonare Senior Editor Oceania: Brad Lord Feature Editor: Sean Klingelhoefer Editors at Large: Larry Chen Bryn Musselwhite News Editor: Mike Garrett Associate Editors: Ben Chandler Keith Charvonia Taryn Croucher Alok Paleri Camille Sebaoui Associate Product Manager: Arslan Golic Drivers: Fredric Aasbø Vaughn Gittin Jr Edward Sandström MADMIKE Whiddett Event Partners  Magazine Partners Merchandise Partners  Automotive Partners  Speedhunters Archives August 2013 (89) July 2013 (99) June 2013 (106) May 2013 (125) April 2013 (104) March 2013 (106) February 2013 (90) January 2013 (99) December 2012 (96) November 2012 (99) October 2012 (103) September 2012 (104) August 2012 (114) July 2012 (115) June 2012 (137) May 2012 (152) April 2012 (138) March 2012 (119) February 2012 (105) January 2012 (132) December 2011 (140) November 2011 (150) October 2011 (170) September 2011 (168) August 2011 (186) July 2011 (174) June 2011 (211) May 2011 (144) April 2011 (120) March 2011 (172) February 2011 (132) January 2011 (152) December 2010 (152) November 2010 (187) October 2010 (174) September 2010 (173) August 2010 (177) July 2010 (189) June 2010 (205) May 2010 (187) April 2010 (211) March 2010 (193) February 2010 (142) January 2010 (162) December 2009 (133) November 2009 (143) October 2009 (149) September 2009 (171) August 2009 (137) July 2009 (167) June 2009 (143) May 2009 (164) April 2009 (164) March 2009 (166) February 2009 (129) January 2009 (166) December 2008 (112) November 2008 (106) October 2008 (122) September 2008 (109) August 2008 (100) July 2008 (149) June 2008 (207) May 2008 (136)  Copyright  2013 Electronic Arts Inc.
