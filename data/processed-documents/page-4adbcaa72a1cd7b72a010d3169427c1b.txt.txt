OVERVIEW Motion pictures, television, performing arts, new media, museums... These creative industries, and others like them, belong to one of the fastest-growing economic sectors in the world. The tremendous growth of these industries has created a need for professionals who can combine both management and leadership skills with a thorough understanding of art, entertainment and media sectors. Drexel's Entertainment  Arts Management (EAM) program prepares students for this challenge by providing both a specialized curriculum through which students may choose an arts or media concentration and a nationally-ranked cooperative education component. Students in Drexels EAM program choose concentrations in media management, performing arts management, or visual arts management. However, unlike other undergraduate programs in this field, students are not required to choose a nonprofit or for-profit focus. This gives our students increased flexibility when choosing their career paths and a distinct professional advantage in todays ever-changing arts and entertainment industries. EAM Concentration in Sports Entertainment Incoming EAM students can also select Sports Entertainment as their concentration. Designed for students interested in the crossover between media and sports, the Sports Entertainment concentration will combine courses in film and television production with classes such as The Business of Sport, Sports Marketing, Promotion and Public Relations, Sports Information and a host of electives in Drexel's Sport Management program including sport law, agent and labor relations, venue management and tourism. The Sports Entertainment management concentration of EAM is a great foundation for careers in fields such as sports broadcasting production and management and media relations and athlete representation.

Career Opportunities A Drexel degree in EAM prepares students for a variety of careers in both for-profit and nonprofit organizations; from creative, hands-on positions to administrative and management roles. Nonprofit creative industries are typically funded through the government, corporations, foundations, and individuals. Americans for the Arts and the Foundation Center estimate the expenditures from these sources at $18.2 billion annually. In the for-profit arena, the movie industry alone grew 34 percent between 1998 and 2003, according to the Motion Picture Association, resulting in industry-wide expenditures of $14 billion. In addition, American television programs are broadcast to more than 125 international markets and broadband Internet is creating countless new opportunities for content creators and managers.
