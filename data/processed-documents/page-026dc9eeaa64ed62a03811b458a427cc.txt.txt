College is a place for higher learning and personal growth, self-expression and community building. Some of the people you'll meet at this prestigious university will be by your side for decades to come. Â  You can learn a little bit from every person you meet in this maze you've set out to navigate. The maze of life. Take, for instance, this dedicated young individual, standing out in the sun frying for some measly nickels and dimes in his pocket at the end of the day. But y'know what? He'll go to sleep tonight, sweat plastered to his forehead, body burnt from the harsh rays, feet sore and shoes muddied by the endless stream of fresh faces entering this fine institution, and he'll know what it means to work. He'll appreciate what it means to live. Â  Sometimes life gives you second chances. Like remember when you wanted to make that great joke to the first guy but couldn't think of the right wording in time? Well, now's your chance! Sometimes opportunities are missed. Life happens. And so what if the joke falls flat. What matters is that you went for it. You had the courage to commit, even if it was only the second time around. Here's a lesson for you, even if you fail, at least you've succeeded at trying.

Yay! I'm your RA. My name is Amun-Ra, but you can just call me Ra 'cause I'm chill like that. Let's break the ice with a little "Two Truths and a Lie." We'll say two true things about ourselves and one lie, and it's up to you to guess which one is not true. Got it? Okay. 1) I brought forth everything in creation by saying its secret name, 2) I have a falcon for a head, and 3) I'm lactose intolerant. What do you guys think... Wrong! It's the second one. I have a falcon's HEAD for a head, not a whole falcon. That would look stupid. That's also a lesson about language. We all need to be sure that we choose our words carefully and keep communication open. That way we'll all avoid conflicts. Also, avoid using "angry" words like "stupid" in public spaces. That was my bad, there. But that's also a lesson about me. Sometimes I make mistakes too. I'm a student just like you! I also just happen to have some administrative disciplinary powers, and the power of flight. And the power to create and destroy with a word.

But you know what else was out? The sides of them tigs. Sure, we got some awesome performances from the likes of Drake, Lady Gaga, and Macklemore. But the real star of the show was the Grade-A sideboobage on the red carpet. So let's skip the formalities and get to the good stuff, shall we? Â  15.

Even choosing which groups to audition for can be its own ordeal if you're not sure what to look for. Here are some hot insider tips that'll put you on the fast track to instrument-free success: Â  Often, groups will run open houses or meet-and-greets before auditions, and if you can successfully pretend to be a member of the group, there is no state or federal law requiring you to ever stop. Every group has its own traditions, like signature songs, year-end beach trips, drowning a freshman, or drowning a couple of freshmen. Plan to be drowned. Any group that performs in goofy hats or sings a semi-ironic rendition of Mulan's "I'll Make A Man Out Of You" is an absolute wellspring of fun and creativity and should be pursued relentlessly.
