Case Study #1 (OEMs): Brand Image, Market Position and Strategies to Broaden Appeal Challenge: A global OEM in the automotive industry wanted to expand product offerings and move brand image up-market in an effort to gain market share and attract younger, more affluent consumers. Solution: IHS Consulting produced extensive vehicle and market forecasts, undertook a highly detailed competitive benchmarking exercise and examined successful premium brand practices from the point of market entry to the present day. Based on this information, our research team identified current and future opportunities and made multi-pronged strategic recommendations on brand image, product features, specifications and advertising strategy. Results: The client was prepared to undertake a successful evolution of its brand image and products to increase market share and volume in a very challenging, mature market. Case Study #2 (Suppliers): Evolving Technology, New Value Proposition and Market Opportunities Challenge: A global tier 1-2 supplier found that its passive driveline technology was being made obsolete by brake-based anti-skid and stability control systems and, as a result, was threatened with the loss of its largest OEM customer. The client asked IHS Consulting to find new markets for its passive technology and to assess the business opportunities for advanced, active systems. Solution: IHS Consulting conducted extensive interviews with OEM suspension, braking and driveline engineering staff in the United States, Europe and Asia and a thorough review of technical literature to create an understanding of the advantages of active driveline applications. We recommended that the client develop active axle torque management systems for developed markets and enter the developing markets with the older technologies. IHS consultants organized a strategic partnership between our client and a tier 1 firm to develop and bring the technology to market. We recommended the engagement of a simulation firm to develop stage-one control algorithms which were used to develop video animations of the technology’s benefits. We then took the animations to the field for market validation through a second round of interviews. Finally, we introduced a third party to the strategic partnership to train our client’s engineering staff to work with OEM customers to integrate active driveline systems into new vehicles. Results: The client gained a first-mover position in the marketplace, retained business with its largest customer at a higher price point and gained new customers in overseas markets, extending the economic life of its capital investments.   To request a exploratory meeting with an IHS Consulting representative, please complete the following information.
