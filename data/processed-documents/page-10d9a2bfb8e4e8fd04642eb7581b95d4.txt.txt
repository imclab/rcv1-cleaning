For the 2006 model year, the G35 coupe continues to add refinements, including available Rear Active Steer; new bi-xenon headlights and revised taillights; additions to the Premium Package, including available Intelligent Key system and Bluetooth Hands-Free Phone System, a new exterior color; and new Sport Package styling features, including unique front fascia and side sills and revised optional rear spoiler. The rear-wheel drive G35 coupe is powered by an advanced, 280-horsepower* V6 engine mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission with manual shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching. The G35 coupe is also available with 6-speed manual transmission delivering 298 horsepower. The G35 coupe?s performance is enhanced by a 4-wheel independent suspension with lightweight aluminum components and highly aerodynamic styling. ?The G35 coupe offers driving enthusiasts everything they want in a sports car - a racing-inspired, driver-oriented, rear-wheel drive platform with a powerful V6 engine all draped under a sensuous, eye-catching two-door body, said Mark Igo, vice president and general manager, Infiniti Division. ?For 2006, the G35 coupe revs things up a notch with available interior, exterior and mechanical refinements. An Emphasis on Performance The G35 coupe is aimed at the true car enthusiast. Its advanced 5-speed automatic transmission features a manual mode function with Downshift Rev Matching, which revs the engine with each downshift to provide better response for the driver. Also available is a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission. Infiniti?s Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) system is standard on every G35 coupe. The foundation for all models is the G35?s standard 3.5-liter DOHC 24-valve V6 engine, producing 280 horsepower on automatic transmission-equipped models and 298 horsepower on the G35 Coupe 6MT. The advanced engine design, part of the award-winning VQ engine series, includes a long list of advanced systems, including a continuously variable valve timing control system, a ?noiseless timing chain for silent operation, a structurally reinforced aluminum engine block and an electronically controlled ?drive-by-wire throttle system. It also features a modular engine design, microfinished crank journals and cam lobes, and molybdenum coated lightweight pistons. For 2006, the G35 coupe is again offered with a standard, advanced 4-wheel multi-link suspension design with extensive use of aluminum-alloy components to reduce unsprung weight and incorporate special ?ripple control shock absorber technology for responsive yet comfortable ride and handling. The front suspension design minimizes alignment changes through use of two separate lower links and a long upper link. The rear design separates the shock absorbers and springs, locating the shock absorber inline with the wheel center to help reduce suspension friction and reduce the wind-up motion of the axle on acceleration. The suspension tuning of the Sport-Tuned Suspension Package (standard on the G35 Coupe 6MT) is more aggressive than the G35 Coupe model, with stiffer spring and shocks and larger diameter stabilizer bars. The handling and stability of the 2006 G35 coupe is further optimized by an available, new Infiniti Rear Active Steer system. Unlike passive rear steering systems, this design features motor-driven control. This system helps improve the vehicle?s handling performance by adjusting the rear suspension geometry according to steering input and vehicle speed. The system?s electronic control unit calculates the desired vehicle dynamics from a series of sensors, including vehicle speed and steering angle, and directs the system actuator to change rear geometry by moving both rear suspension lower links. The result is sports car-like agility, combined with luxury stability and ride quality. The Rear Active Steer system was first introduced on the 2006 Infiniti M45 and M35 Sport models. It is available on the 2006 G35 Coupe 6MT models with Premium Package and G35 coupe models with Sport and Premium Packages. In addition, the Rear Active Steer Package adds an enhanced vehicle-speed-sensitive power steering system with a 15.1:1 steering gear ratio. The 2006 G35 coupe also benefits from its use of the innovative FM (for Front Mid-ship) platform, which positions the engine behind the front axle. This results in a nearly optimized front-to-rear weight balance of 54:46, which factors in weight transfer during key handling maneuvers, such as entering and exiting corners. The FM platform also positions its large diameter wheels and tires out near the corners of the vehicle, providing an extra measure of handling stability. The G35 Coupe is equipped with standard 6-spoke, 17-inch cast aluminum wheels and P225/50VR17 tires up front with P235/50VR17 tires in the rear. Also offered are 7-spoke, 18-inch titanium-finish wheels and high-performance tires. The G35 Coupe 6MT and Sport-Tuned Suspension Package equipped models offer 5-spoke, 19-inch forged aluminum-alloy wheels with P225/40YR19 tires in front and P245/40YR19 tires in the rear. The Sport-Tuned Suspension Package also adds a standard Viscous Limited-Slip Differential (VSLD). All G35 coupes feature a standard Tire Pressure Monitor System (TPMS). Standard braking system components include 4-wheel ventilated disc brakes with large rotors, along with Brake Assist (BA) and Electronic Brake force Distribution (EBD). Sporty Exterior, Refined Interior The exterior of the 2006 G35 coupe offers styling that is both sporty and elegant. It features new projector-beam bi-xenon headlights, integrated fog lights, revised LED tail lamps, and body-color, dual power, heated, remote-controlled outside mirrors. An Aero Package is available, with a revised rear spoiler and rear side air diffusers. Also offered on all models is a dual sliding glass sunroof with one-touch open/close operation. The Sport Package adds a unique front fascia and side sills for 2006. The G35 coupe shares the G35 sedan?s long 112.2-inch wheelbase but is several inches shorter in overall length (182.2 inches versus 186.9) and height (54.8 inches versus 57.7). With its performance-oriented chassis, wider wheel openings and fenders, the G35 coupe is also slightly wider than the sedan (71.5 inches versus 69.0). A new exterior color is available for 2006 Liquid Platinum. The G35 coupe?s 4-passenger interior is equally attractive, combining a driver-oriented cockpit with an Infiniti level of luxury and design detail. The use of real aluminum on the center console and dashboard areas provides an added degree of authenticity and optional Rosewood trim adds a warmer feel for those who desire it. Leather-appointed seats (with heated front seats) are standard. The sport-contoured front bucket seats are 8-way power adjustable for the driver and 4-way power adjustable for the passenger. A power walk-in feature allows access to the rear seats. The rear seatback folds down for added cargo flexibility. An in-dash 6-disc CD changer, with mp3 capability, is standard, while a digital Bose premium audio system with eight speakers and a DVD-based Infiniti Navigation System with 7.0-inch wide power retractable monitor are optional. New for 2006, the Premium Package for G35 Coupe 6MT models adds Bluetooth Hands-Free Phone System and driver?s seat and steering wheel memory. The G35 Coupe model adds driver?s entry/exit assist to the Premium Package. A new Premium Package with Intelligent Key is available on G35 Coupe models. Other interior amenities include an Infiniti signature analog clock, Fine Vision electro-fluorescent gauge illumination and driver and passenger one-touch up/down power windows and door locks, tilt and telescoping steering, to name just a few. High-Level of Safety From a safety standpoint, every 2006 G35 coupe comes with a standard Advanced Air Bag System with dual-stage front supplemental air bags with seat belt sensors and RF occupant classification sensor, front-seat side-impact supplemental air bags and roof-mounted curtain side-impact supplemental air bags. Also standard are 3-point ALR/ELR seat belts (driver?s side ELR only) and front seat belts with pretensioners and load limiters and adjustable upper anchors, front seat Active Head Restraints and the LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren) system. The G35 coupe?s FM platform Zone Body construction is designed to help protect occupants in a collision by efficiently absorbing crash energy through use of front and rear crushable zones. In a high-speed frontal collision, for example, the crushable zone crumples while the engine is designed to move under the occupant compartment. This has the effect of expanding the crushable zone, thereby helping to reduce the deceleration g-force and simultaneously helping to minimize cabin deformation, especially in the lower leg area. In offset impacts, a strong body construction is needed to decrease the amount of cabin deformation. Other features also contribute to improved occupant safety, including the breakaway construction of the propeller shaft (connected with the engine-drop function) and the double-wall construction of the bulkhead. Models and Packages The 2006 Infiniti G35 coupe is offered in two fully equipped models, the G35 Coupe and G35 Coupe 6MT. A number of optional packages are offered, including the previously detailed Rear Active Steer Package and the Sport-Tuned Suspension Package. The Premium Package (available on the G35 Coupe 6MT only) includes power one-touch open/close sunroof, Bose audio system, power tilt and telescopic steering, dual HVAC controls, auto on/off headlights, HomeLink Universal Transceiver, Bluetooth Hands-Free Phone System, driver?s seat and steering wheel memory and automatic anti-glare rearview mirror. Also, new for 2006, a Premium Package with Intelligent Key (available on the G35 Coupe only) is offered with Intelligent Key and driver-side entry/exit assist added to the above mentioned Premium Package. Other packages include the Performance Tire  Wheel Package (G35 Coupe model only) with 18-inch wheels and tires; and the Aero Package with rear spoiler and side diffusers. Individually available options include the sunroof, Infiniti Navigation System (available with Premium Package), and genuine Rosewood trim (available with the Premium Package).
