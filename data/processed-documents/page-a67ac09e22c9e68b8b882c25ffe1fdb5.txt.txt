Myers built all of the furniture by hand with his fathers help. A 1947 Mercury coupe fitted with a 1946 Ford grille and a surfboard roof resembles a woodie wagon and acts as the reception desk, while a 1956 Olds 98 and a pink 1959 Cadillac have been made into couches. Myers fondness for the work of legendary custom painter and pinstriper Larry Watson was the inspiration behind recreating Watsons shop as his private office. Even his office desk is a tribute to Watsons candy-and-white pearl 1959 Caddy. Special Thanks to Marty Giles (a Tail Fins and Chrome viewer) for sending us the photos.
