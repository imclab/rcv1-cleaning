I wanted to create a place where I could provide what I think is the very best in veterinary care.” Dr. Levitsky shared. Healing Paws is a well-equipped, modern veterinary hospital offering general medicine, surgery, dental and preventative health services, but also provides holistic care including acupuncture, herbal therapy and homeopathy. Dr. Levitsky wanted to offer something more. “The missing component, in my opinion, was attention to the experience for both patient and their human companions. From the moment you enter Healing Paws Wellness Center my highest priority is the comfort and well-being for both patient and owner.”  At Healing Paws pets don’t have to deal with slippery floors, strange smells or sterile exam rooms. Instead, you and your pet are greeted by a water wall, soothing music, rubber non-slip flooring and custom exam rooms with fluffy dog beds and plush window seats for the kitties. The entire Healing Paws team is dedicated to ensuring each patient has a calm and positive experience.  Healing Paws focuses on your pets’ wellness and quality of life regardless of their age. Focus is put on client education so that every owner feels confident about caring for their pet through all of life’s stages. Our wellness visits include getting to know you and your pet, a complete physical exam and review of all health and nutritional issues. We wrap up our wellness visits with a comprehensive plan to improve your pets overall health and well-being.  Healing Paws Veterinary Wellness Center is open Monday – Friday 8:30am – 6:00pm and Saturday 9:00am – 1:00pm.

While the world is familiar with celebrity glitz and glam, actor and entertainer hopefuls understand the intensity of pressure and heartbreak that often comes with trying to break into the industry. Myx TV gives you a front row seat to follow a group of Filipino Americans in the quest for their ultimate dream as it launches its first and all-new reality series, Starcamp. Created by Grand Slam Productions, Inc., Starcamp premieres on Wednesday, September 4th at 8/7c.  The challenges will not be easy as candidates get the best yet most stringent training from vocal, acting, and modeling coaches and legends before they are put to the test. And as if competing against massive talent wasn’t difficult enough, watch them navigate through culture shock, language barriers and the nerve-wracking fear of performing on the big stage and on TV. With interesting personalities, the dramatic makings of primetime reality shows, and the mind-blowing talent and music of today’s biggest competitions, it is a must-see series where it all comes down to who will shine and who can survive.  California auditions brought together singer Jaron Liclican of Milpitas, model Tommy Esguerra of Long Beach, Jemimah Garcia of Avondale, Arizona, California State University Carson graduate Matthew Wong, model Rhobbyn Concepcion of Chula Vista, advance theater and TV hosting-trained Allen Mendoza from Vallejo, multi-awarded saxophonist, singer and composer Nathan Concepcion, singer and dancer Ian Baclig of La Puente, Australian-born Karen Cabrera, and aspiring actress Jennifer Habana from Garden Grove. Together, they leave the comforts of home for a shot at show business on the other side of the globe. An exciting twist also brings Renzo Vergara of Antique, Philippines into the mix.  The 13-episode series traces the stories of each contestant, their auditions, and their adventurous travel back to the Philippines, where they will immerse in rigorous training offshore, working hard to become Philippine entertainment’s next big stars. Starcamp is hosted by Filipino American entertainer Amber Davis.  “There is so much undiscovered talent in the U.S and showing how they get their first big break is a compelling story, said Miguel Santos, General Manager for Myx TV. “Taking Filipino Americans to the Philippines to make it in show business there makes it all the more interesting. Starcamp broadens our programming line-up as our first original reality show.”  Get ready for a one-of-a-kind reality series this fall.

The book is receiving rave reviews.  ”One of the most entertaining books that I have read in this genre. It is a coming of age story filled with laughter and tears, violent and brutal murders, unbridled sex, and of course, werewolves,” commented John Carl Beuchler, Director of the planned movie. Beuchler signed on for the direction of Hidden Valley after reading just a few pages of the screenplay and the book adaption, which he described as “…so right from a cinematic stand point…viscerally and dynamically to the page as it would play on the screen.”  Beuchler is most noted for his Direction on Paramount Pictures’ Friday the 13 Part VII: The New Blood (1988) and his design as Director of Special Effects for Troll (1986). Buechler’s work in cinematic monster-making is legendary and some of his creative monster work will be featured in a special theatrical show at the book release party August 20th.

It’s time for God’s stars to stand up on the stages of film, fashion, music and theater,” says Adam She, AMTC’s Executive Director.  Non-profit Christian ministry Actors, Models and Talent for Christ has been scouting the country, searching for actors, models, singers, dancers and comedians who are called to become positive role models in the entertainment industry.  Founded in 1982, by supermodel Millie Lewis and her daughter Carey Lewis, AMTC is a mission and a movement that provides aspiring performers with professional direction, industry introductions and spiritual preparation so they can shine for Christ in the entertainment industry.  This anticipated Winston-Salem event will be hosted by Carey Lewis, Chief Serving Officer for AMTC. Carey says, ‘In our first 24 years, AMTC became a power player, launching stars in film, fashion, music and theater, but something was missing.’ She discovered the ‘It’ was God. Lewis had a ‘come-to-Jesus’ meeting in 2006. She felt called to bring AMTC along. ‘People thought I was crazy, that AMTC could not exist as a boldly Christian company, but they were wrong,’ laughs Lewis. ‘When God appoints a person or a company to a mission, He will see it done and nothing on earth can stop it.’  Carey is thankful that AMTC has become a shepherd of God’s movement into media: the most influential mission field on earth. ‘God is preparing an army of performers.’ She says, ‘AMTC’s job is to find them and guide them up the mountains of arts and entertainment.’  AMTC teaches talented people what they need to know and connects them with an array of talent agents, managers and casting directors as the go-to” source who can create larger opportunities, as confirmed by corporate representatives.  Actors, Models and Talent for Christ Winston-Salem auditions are being held at the Winston-Salem Marriott/425 North Cherry Street /Winston-Salem, NC 27101/phone: 336.725.3500.

She is also offering a helpful meditations book with various techniques on Indiegogo.com—in efforts to fund and expand her site. The site’s purpose is to bring together both scientific and spiritual aspects of meditation, inspire others to meditate, and examine it as a potential root solution to our planet’s most pressing issues.  GammaGenius is committed to exploring meditation’s wide array of effects at the individual and collective level. It also seeks to present how the brain is affected by different factors, such as music and the environment. Essays and accompanying videos are meant to present concepts in a creative way. The site also offers free meditation sessions on its live page, and there are hopeful plans to expand it to include other live meditators.  Karuṇā believes meditation has unbounded potential in education. GammaGenius will also explore how this simple daily practice can positively affect education. She also wishes to look into the role it plays in enhancing creativity.  In her live sessions, she emphasizes two techniques: Breath Awareness and Clear Mind. These two methods in combination, proved effective after one month of three daily thirty-minute sessions. By anchoring her focus on her breath and then going into Clear Mind, she overcame harmful and stagnating effects of stress and ADD to promote mental clarity, creativity, productivity, and well-being.  She has observed people inspired to make positive changes from watching a documentary, reading a book, or listening to a talk—but sometimes revert. She shares that the way to create permanent change is by restructuring your own brain through daily meditation.  There is a sea of information regarding this subject that Karuṇā wishes to disseminate through GammaGenius—from the scientific to the mystical. The funding she seeks is to provide this information to the public in a creative way. To visit GammaGenius, please go to: http://www.gammagenius.com.
