Use A Photo A  good photo can improve response by 150% or more! Take one  with a digital camera or ask your local photo finishing  shop to make a few jpeg's (from a hard copy) for you on  a disk or cd. From within your account you can add up to  15 photos plus descriptions anytime. Be sure to take trunk  and engine shots, it's also best to come clean with closeup  shots of any damaged areas. 3. Set The Right Price You  know how much you want for your vehicle, but do you know  how realistic that price really is? The Canadian used car  price? Find out what your car is really worth using Â» The Kelley  Blue Book (US) . Check the price of used vehicles in  your area with Â» Edmunds  True Market Value (US) finder. Find the trade-in value  and suggested retail price at the Â» IntelliChoice  CarCenter (US) or finally Â» search through our website for vehicles matching yours and see what others are asking.  For  most Canadian's using the above means you have to do the  US exchange rate to guesstimate the value of the Canadian  used car price or you could compare Canadian Black Book  pricing. Our friends at GM Canada have direct access to appraised  used car values right here . These  links launch a new window which originates from www.canadianblackbook.com. State  in your description that the price is OBO (or best offer)  - this might convince buyers to call or email you if the  price is close to their budget. This will also give you  the opportunity to justify the price and negotiate the sale. 4. Disclose Vehicle History Show  potential buyers you are trustworthy and put their mind  at ease by giving them a Â» Canadian  CarProof Vehicle History Report or a Â» Carfax  Vehicle History Report on your vehicle. Prove to them  that you and your vehicle have nothing to hide! In  Ontario, for example, you will need to know  what  paperwork do I have to complete if I want to sell my used  vehicle privately?  Private sellers of motor  vehicles are legally obliged to provide buyers with a Used  Vehicle Information Package (UVIP). This package contains  the vehicle's registration history in Ontario, vehicle lien  information (i.e. whether there were any outstanding debts  on the vehicle in Ontario up until two business days before  the UVIP was purchased), average wholesale value on which  the minimum tax owed is based and other information dealing  with vehicle safety standards, retail sales tax and forms  for an affidavit and bill of sale. The Used Vehicle Information  Package costs $20. It is available from all Ministry  of Transportation Driver and Vehicle Licence Issuing Offices .  It is also available by calling the Ministry of Consumer  and Business Services, Personal Property Security Registration  Branch, which enables consumers to use their VISA or MasterCard  to order the package. From the Toronto area, call (416)  325-8847; from elsewhere in the province, use our toll-free  line -- 1-800-267-8847. There is also a TTY number, 416-326-8866,  for the speech/hearing impaired. For more information on Buying,  Selling or Transferring Used Vehicles , to order a  Used Vehicle Information Package (UVIP) , or for a copy  of the brochure Buying  and Selling a Used Vehicle in Ontario (*pdf) , visit  the Ministry of Transportation website at www.mto.gov.on.ca * Ontario  information from cbs.gov.on.ca Always check  your local Provincial website for similar regulations. 3. Lemon Check Determine  if your car has a lemon classification. If it has favorable ratings, then prove  it to potential buyers. This service has become the defacto  standard in doing a quick check on a used car Â» Carfax  Lemon Check! or Â» CarProof  vehicle history report !  5. Good Presentation Perceived  value goes a long way! Tidy up your car before you sell  it. First impressions are everything! Wash the entire body, clean the windows and give it a good  wax job. Clean ash trays and throw out garbage, vacuum   air freshen the inside  trunk, shine the rims, hub  caps and tires to a blinding glow. 6. Extended Advertising Even  though you want to sell your car online, another effective  option is to use your MotoSeller.com  Ad No. to market your vehicle beyond our website.  Buyers can be pulled to your online ad from other online  classifieds, as well as from traditional advertising like  in your local newspaper. Hold your description to a minimum  while leading buyers to more descriptive online details  and photos. You can measure your success by the number of  page views your ad receives. Newspaper  Example: 99  Ford Explorer, Exc Cond.  $19k/obo. Call 555-5555 or  MotoSeller.com # 55555 When  logged in use our metrics to see the number of times someone  has replied to your ad, the number of times someone has  viewed your ad and the number of times someone told  a friend about your ad. 7.  Maximizing Inquiries As  mentioned above, when you view your ad detail page, or log  into your account we show you the number of ad  views your ad has received since posted. This  information can be used by you to decide what changes might  be useful. For example, if the ad views show that a lot  of people have been looking at your ad, but you're not getting  enough inquiries, maybe you need to add a photo or the current photo needs to be replaced with a better  one, or maybe you need to adjust the asking price slightly - check the selling  price in your area (US only) and/or appraised  used car values right here . If the ad views are low  you may need to change your headline to attract more clickthroughs! 7.  Showing The Vehicle  If you try to sell used car online you'll still need to  show the vehicle. Meet in an agreed upon public  area and try to take someone with you. Safety  in numbers. Be honest with potential buyers about any serious  problems or repairs. Produce a  vehicle history report or show your regular maintenance  records. If your buyer wants to take a test drive, make  sure he/she has a valid drivers  license and proof of insurance . Dress respectably.  If you dont appear to take good care of yourself,  your buyer may feel that is how you treated your car as  well! 8.  Closing The Sale Write  a receipt for you and  your buyer with signatures on both copies. Include a statement  that the car is being bought as  is . Include all pertinent info on the receipt  so the terms of the deal cannot be misinterpreted. Keep  the receipt for your records.

Avoiding Scams Car, truck, boat and motorcycle buyers   sellers, particularly those in the market for used  vehicles, have flocked to the Internet in recent years to  search for killer deals on pre-owned wheels.  Market Research estimates that nearly 30 percent of the  42.6 million used cars that changed hands in the North America  last year were bought using the Internet. As most of us know, used-car buying is  a business that has traditionally created a bad name for  itself. But while consumers and ethical auto dealers have  benefited greatly from the Internet, so too have crooked  buyers  sellers. As such, you need to be aware of potential  scams. Here are some of the most common ones directed toward  buyers  sellers online:  Certified Check Scams - This scam  is often perpetrated on sellers of used cars over the Internet  thorough classified ads and auctions. A buyer indicates  that he wants to buy the car and pay with a cashier's check.  At the last minute, the buyer creates a reason why he needs  to write the check for more money and have the seller wire  him the difference. The check turns out to be a fake, but  it is often discovered long after the seller has wired the  money. In addition, the seller is responsible for covering  the money for the fake check. To avoid check scams, call  the issuing bank before you accept the check and wait for  the check to clear before you transfer the car into the  buyer's name. Bogus Escrow Services - Online  vehicle sellers often use escrow services, which collect  and verify payment from a buyer. The money is held by the  service until all parties are satisfied with the sale. There  have been some instances of phony escrow services operating  on the Internet. Make the transaction through a reputable  third party escrow service, perhaps an escrow account with  a law firm of your choice or www.escrow.com .  Some Fraud sites often claim they are recommended by eBay,  eBay Motors, or Yahoo! Auctions. You may see the list of  sites eBay actually recommends by clicking  here . Make sure you check out an escrow service with SOS4Auctions.com or escrowfraud.com .  They catalog the good and bad services. The best way to avoid most scams is to  make sure you never transfer ownership of your vehicle until  you have the cash in your hand. That means, you either get  cash from the buyer or wait for the cashier's check to clear.  Avoid buyers who will never meet you or never wish to see  the vehicle in person (overseas). Avoid taking personal  checks and allowing buyers to pay the car off over time.  If buying, always verify the seller actually has/owns the  item for sale and meet them face-to-face to view the vehicle  . If you follow these few precautions, your buying and selling  experience should go smoothly.
