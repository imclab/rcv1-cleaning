Abstract I: Picture Books â A Peek at Whatâs Out There! This session begins in the hotel where participants will be provided with e a brief introduction to the array of authors and titles that are available to the seminar participants if they wish to pursue the world of the picture book in their teaching. The aim is to give a taste of what can be found; look at some author and illustrator styles and hopefully motivate participants into furthering their relationship with one or other picture book. Â The session will continue in the Kinokuniya bookshop, where a number of picture books will be available on display and to purchase. The objective of this session is for the seminar participants to select a title which they think is suitable for their context to use in the workshop on Friday. Abstract II: Words and Beyond: The Texts in Your Context This workshop will enable participants to use the knowledge and information gained from the seminar to discuss and share ideas of how to exploit a picture book. Â We hope that together participants can discuss and justify the selection a particular picture book; devise a small number of tasks and activities; provide clear learning outcomes and outline how children will benefit from interacting with the said picture book. This will be the first step towards providing a small bank of ideas for educators to access online through the British Council. Maha Siripathy Maha Sripathy is a teacher educator and has been working with language and literacy teachers in Australia, Singapore, India and the region. Much of her work with teachers and with NGOs focuses on language curriculum development, empowerment through critical literacy and raising awareness of and sensitivity to language. She is also actively involved in the translation of literary works and has been invited to adjudicate in literary and creative writing competitions. As past president and secretary of The Society for Reading and Literacy she conscientiously promoted childrenâs literature and reading to children. In her present capacity as president of the English Language and Literature Teachersâ Association, Singapore(ELLTAS), she organizes regular professional workshops Â to develop English Language teachersâ knowledge and understanding of effective pedagogies. The use of literature to develop critical and creative thinking is a special strand the society has been actively promoting through its seminars and cluster forums. Abstract I :Picture Power: Literacy through Critical Engagement with Visual Texts Stories are generally assumed to provide pleasure and entertainment. This is especially true of stories for children. The fun element is an important feature and hence the significant role accorded to illustrations. While much attention is paid to the linguistic text in childrenâs literature, illustrations are viewed as mere appendages and therefore command less attentive analysis. And yet the ability to read the visual texts demands knowledge of cultures, histories and lived experiences way beyond the thoughts encapsulated in written texts. This session will walk delegates through the subtexts that run parallel in selected childrenâs literature to show how teaching children ways of reading the illustrations develops not just their linguistic knowledge but also their interpretative and analytical skills. The power of visuals to capture and convey the cultural, social and political situatedness of texts will be the focus.

Abstract I : Animating the Classroom with Picture Books By choosing to use picture books in the classroom, teachers have the privilege and pleasure of introducing a thoroughly enjoyable and magical route to learning. Picture books may be used in many ways and in every area of the curriculum, to meet a variety of goals and introduce a wide range of subjects and themes. As teachers, we are only limited in our use of these books by our imagination and the willingness of children to explore situations and worlds both familiar and new. In this session, Daphne Lee will share her experiences of using picture books in discussion groups, workshops and in the classroom, and discuss ways of turning children on to the magic of picture books as well as how to avoid turning them off. Abstract II : Letâs Talk About Books Book discussion groups are a great way to introduce children, of any age, to the joys of reading. In this interactive workshop participants will learn the basics of running such a group, including deciding on the number of participants; composition of the group; how to select books for discussion; and how to get participants to talk about the chosen books. This workshop will focus on the use of picture books in a discussion group. Participants should try to read Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak before attending this workshop, as this book will serve as the training model for this workshop.

Abstract II :Oliver and Stephanie Talk About Picture Book Perspectives Having heard how illustrators develop the story pictures on the page, this session will probe the illustrators' art from a socio-cultural perspective. A look at illustrations in different genres and the impact of cultural and personal experiences on what translates as pictures on the page will be discussed. To what extent does the illustration embellish the story? How does cultural aesthetics frame illustrations? How do illustrators deal with identity and popular culture? Has and will globalization diminish or displace the uniqueness of the personal in picture book illustrations? These and other questions will connect the illustrators' world to the print medium in order to explore the possible co-existence of different cultural perspectives on key aspects such as voice, humour and history.

Janet Evans Janet Evans is a Senior Lecturer in Education at Liverpool Hope University. Â Formerly an Early Years and primary school teacher she has written nine books on language, literacy and maths education for Early Years and Primary educators. Â Her last book, Literacy Moves On: Using Popular Culture, New Technologies and Critical Literacy in the Primary Classroom (2005) was published by David Fulton and Heinemann, whilst her latest book, Talking Beyond the Page:Reading and Responding to Picturebooks which focuses on the importance of responding orally to picturebooks is due to be published in April 2009 by Routledge. Â Janet is currently doing freelance consultancy two days each week. Her ongoing research interests include childrenâs literature, critical literacy, reader response and interactive writing linked to popular culture. Abstract I : Talking Beyond the Page : Â Reading and Responding to the Picture Books This presentation will be a blend of theory and practice and will enable delegates to take a closer look at picture books as a genre and to see how they can be used in the ELT/ESL classroom. Initially consideration will be given to what picture books are, their characteristics and how they 'work'. Different types of picture books will be considered and the picture book as an art form will be looked at. The presentation will then focus on who picture books are for and how they are an essential part of the primary curriculum, promoting oracy and literacy when used effectively. Â Picture books should be read to children for pleasure however they can also be used as a stimulus to make children think and talk about âbigâ issues in the world in which they live. Â Some childrenâs oral and written responses to particular picture books will be shared, along with a selection of their individual thoughts about picture books in general. Â This presentation will be visually multimodal and references to research will be made where appropriate. Abstract II :Talking About Books : Using Reader Response as a Way to Interact with Books This practical workshop will refer to some of the points made in the first presentation. It will consider why reading and responding to texts should be an essential part of a language rich curriculum. Delegates will be introduced to the term Reader Response and will be shown how to employ Aidan Chamberâs âTell Meâ model of responding to texts prior to sharing some work done by young children in relation to the picture book, Tusk Tusk by David McKee. Â Consideration will be given to how children can be encouraged to respond to texts (orally and in written format) in whole class and small group situations and reference will be made to research in relation to picture books and reader response.

Abstract I : Creativity Through Story and Drama This talk aims to show how an integrated approach to storytelling and drama can be a powerful vehicle for developing young learnersâ language skills and potential for creativity. We will start by considering the shared features of stories and drama. We will then experience and explore a detailed sequence of pedagogical activities which exemplify and illustrate classroom practice. The main focus of discussion will be on ways to scaffold â or support â pupilsâ learning, and engage them in exploring relevant issues through the social and communal experience of classroom drama. The talk will also consider the use of âdistancingâ strategies to guide children to think beyond the pictures and text and to develop creative thinking skills. We will also explore links from picture books to other areas of the curriculum and the shared, cultural dimension of storytelling and drama in promoting citizenship and fostering positive attitudes in todayâs world. Abstract II : Multiple Intelligences and Picture Books The main aim of this session is to show how Multiple Intelligence (MI) theory can provide a powerful pedagogical framework which maximises the benefits of using picture books in language lessons in different cultural settings. We will start off by briefly reviewing some aspects of the theory itself: the nature of different intelligences, the criteria for defining intelligences, the issues and problems the theory raises, the reasons for the strong appeal of the theory to primary educators, and the way it can be used to provide âentry pointsâ to childrenâs learning. We will then look at a practical example of applying an MI approach to working with a picture book and consider its potential for enhancing both literacy and language learning. Finally, we will experiment and discuss the potential benefits of applying an MI framework to a range of picture books in primary classrooms in different cultural settings.
