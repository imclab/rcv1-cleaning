   New England Car Culture     Monday, August 20, 2012 Mark's Auto Parts Cruise Night, Aug 20th Just as a heads up for everyone, I wanted to let you know that New England Car Culture will be in East Granby, CT browsing around at Mark's Auto Part's tonight, for their weekly cruise night. Mark's Cruise Night is the largest in New England, with over 700 cars regularly, every week. Wow. Tonight, Aug 20th, is Volkswagen Night, so be sure to show up. I'll be snapping pics, and looking for some new rides that I can showcase. I hope to see you there! If you need directions, just click here to go to Google Maps...
