We offer quality, brand name products only. We refuse to sell "No Name" or Low-End products because we believe the quality of what a company markets, illustrates the integrity of their business principles. That's why you won't find any second rate imported vehicle lifts, or other cheap foreign made product on this site no matter how much the profit margin may be. Be wary of cut-rate lifts  other items that will most likely need future repair sooner and more often. Imported lift parts can be difficult to find, even from the company that sold it in the USA, since many of them are companies that have no real substance. If something should go terribly wrong? Don't expect some obscure foreign manufacturer's lawyers or insurance company to be flying in from China right away to stand next to you in Court, if that's were it all ends up when somebody sues... They just won't show, there's little way to force them to stand by their products. Caveat Emptor - Let the Buyer Beware is the Golden Rule, so be careful. Some solely internet based companies that neither install equipment nor provide repair or warranty service on the equipment they sell, are often operating out of a Home or PO Box with no real Brick  Mortar warehouse/office location. Somesell cheaply made imported auto lifts as well as substandard lubrication equipment, low-gradeair-compressors with aluminum pumps instead of cast-iron pumps and various otherproducts that are unproven, non-certified, scrap. Manyhave absolutely no control over whether the product they are marketing gets re-designed by the Chinese Manufacturer when they're purchasing more of the foreign made products to sell to unsuspecting Buyers. So if you want to buy the same item you purchased previously only eight months later, it may have the same model number, but it also may not be the same actual design you bought previously. Furthermore, when it breaks down and you have to repair it, what then? Do they even make the parts for it anymore or has it been re-designed again? Who really made the product and how long have they been making them? For all anyone knows they may have been making cloths dryersbefore deciding to start cranking out their brand of auto shop equipment. We actually do have a few imported lift models available, their final assembly is performed in the USA where the lifts are matched up with a SPX Fenner USA made Power Unit and the lifts we offer have Solid Warranties from the American Company supplying them to us. Not the inferior product with some Chinese Made Power Unit you will find being sold by some other competing companies. Furthermore, repair parts for the items we offer, will always be available many years down the road, if and when you ever need them, because the imported lift models we choose to provide are designed by well established American Companies and built specifically to their own design and standards. The companies have names like Challenger Lift, Rotary Lift, Quality Lift and BendPak Lifts... Well known American Companies that have been providing Automotive Shop Equipment Products for many years and decided to provide a few imported models along with their traditional American Made Models to answer the cost-effective lift requirements some Customers want as a result of our current U.S. economy. We may not have the absolute lowest prices, like some other companies may boast about having... But the quality reliability of what we sell, more than justifies any negotiable difference intheir cost. That's somethingfew of our Competitors can boast about. Smitty DELIVERED on our website means NO HIDDEN FEES and we mean it! You will get no hidden fees or charges, the price you see is the price you pay when you purchase an item here that says Delivered. Use caution when purchasing from a company that adds shipping onto the items when you're checking out. A great example for instance, is that most Equipment Manufacturers include the shipping at a flat rate percentage, and there is simply no reason for a merchant not to include any delivery fee right in the cost of the equipment if it applies. Many disingenuous companies add on delivery fees after you decide to go ahead with a purchase so they can exaggerate the shipping cost and claim it's a legitimate delivery fee, but it's not. One exception to our Delivered Policy - BendPak / Ranger does charge an additional Rural Area Transportation Zone shipping fee depending on the Zip Code of the delivery address that will only affect the very rural area deliveries. We have no control over BendPak's RATZ Fees but we will pay part of the fee for you anyway. Here is the information so you can see for yourself ahead of time. Rural Area Transportation Zone DIRECT SHIPPING POINT NOTE TO CUSTOMER: RATZ Fees that are charged by BendPak/Ranger are not covered in the Free Delivery links on this website. Transportation and shipping to these remote and rural locations are non-direct shipping points with higher associated delivery costs. You can click the link provided and enter your ZIP code to check if your shipping address is included on the RATZ fee list. If it is on the list, the RATZ fee charged by BendPak is 5.0% but we will discount that fee to 3.5 % of the cost. Smitty LINK  Many items on our website offer an additional 2% off if purchased by check instead of processing a credit card.If you are purchasing a BendPak or Ranger product, and your ZIP CODE is on the RATZ FEE LIST, you can cut your RATZ cost by saving 2% more by paying by check instead of Credit Card. We pass the savings on to you, and that can be quite a bit if you plan on purchasing several lifts or air compressor and multiple items.
