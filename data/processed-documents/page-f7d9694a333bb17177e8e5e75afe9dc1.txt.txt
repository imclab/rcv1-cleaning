Details are limited, but Auto Express is reporting the coupe will be low, long, and dramatic. While this is a little vauge, we can expect a massive grille, a center-mounted exhaust and distinctive C-pillars which will mimic the legendary Capri. A variety of engines will be available, but the range-topping model will boast a turbocharged 2.0-liter EcoBoost with 250 PS (184 kW / 247 hp) and 360 Nm (265 lb-ft) of torque. This will likely enable the ST coupe to accelerate from 0-60 mph in six seconds, before hitting an electronically limited 155 mph (250 km/h). If that hasn't tickled your fancy, the car will also have a sport-tuned suspension and a torque vectoring system.

What's the point? a 3 Door Hatchback :) with the ST Badge would be nice to kick GTI's Ass... but a coupe? with a trunk? it's wrong, americans just don't get the hatchbacks, they prefer butt ugly fat cars, that's why you have the lincoln brand... make a lincoln MKWhtaever... and leave the focus alone, we don't need another flop, besides, the current american focus generation has already a coupe that is er...

I do agree with joelynn that they should return the type Capri again. And if Opel brings a new Manta... old days revive. 0 0 November 25, 2010 11:22 am report abuse | reply 9962 zeiar If it is a Capri revival it should be RWD and not some stupid 3 door hatch!!!
