It was half a day of Ali messing around in the passenger footwell whilst I helped where I could, but Im very happy with the finished article.

This meant car geeks across the land, including myself, took their projects (read: moneypits ) out of hibernation to remind themselves of that weird love/hate relationship they share with their vehicles.

I plan to change that this year; the parts stockpile is growing, and Ive got some plans to make sure the 200SX is driving exactly how I want it to by the end of the season. Today is the first day of spring, and the car is officially out of hibernation and back on the road.

Unfortunately I didnt get an opportunity to get any good snaps of his car (why do I always neglect the car I arrive in?). Despite this, his FD is pretty much a big deal. Subtle on the outside, savage where it counts. Riding in cars like this often makes me think that I got enthusiastic about the wrong chassis! Anyway, Ill be pushing Ryan to invest in some RPF1s, and hopefully there will be a full photoshoot on the cards ASAP.
