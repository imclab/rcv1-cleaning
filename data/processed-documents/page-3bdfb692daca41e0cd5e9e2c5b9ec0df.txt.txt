Top Speed: 149 mph The current Hyundai Genesis Coupe went on sale in United States dealerships back on February 26, 2009. It was a pretty cool sports car powered by a 2.0-liter DOHC inline four-cylinder that delivered 212 HP and 217 lb.-ft. of torque, but in 2011, Hyundai tried making it even better by adding a new version: the Coupe 3.8 R-Spec . This new coupe is powered by a 3.8 liter V6 engine that delivers 306 HP, which is obviously better than the previous model, but apparently, that addition simply wasnt enough for Hyundai. Now, theyve brought the facelift version of the Genesis Coupe to the 2012 Detroit Auto Show, in its American version. The new 2013 Genesis Coupe sports more aggressive coupe styling, complemented by an improved interior and design. It will be available with 4-cylinder and V6 engines, both of which benefit from significant technology enhancements, a 3.8-liter V6 engine with sophisticated direct-injection technology, and a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine that has been upgraded to a more precise twin-scroll turbocharger and larger intercooler. UPDATE 01/09/2012 : This review has been updated with the official images and specs of the Hyundai Genesis Coupe.

Exterior The Hyundai Genesis Coupe was the first model to adopt Hyundais new design language. However, for 2013, the company went a little bit further and have adapted a new design language that was initially offered for the Veloster in early 2011. The Genesis Coupe has received an aggressively redesigned front fascia, grille, headlights, LED daytime running lights, fog lights, and hood with heat extractor cues, as well as new taillights with premium LED illumination and new contours. Hyundai continued the redesign work by maximizing the depth between the fenders and the greenhouse and by adding enlarged openings in the front fascia that allow for better engine breathing along with a more aggressive look. The rear is now dominated by dual asymmetrical exhaust tips integrated with the blackout rear diffuser. Rounding out the exterior are new 18- and 19" alloy wheel designs with deeper dimensional sculpting. Interior The interior of the Genesis Coupe was also significantly improved for the new model year. The instrument panel crash pad now features a stitched-seam appearance for a distinctly upscale look with an electroluminescent gauge cluster for premium ambiance and superior readability. A new driver-side rear seat walk-in assist function has also been added for more convenient rear seat access from the driver’s side. The driver will take his mpg, torque level (3.8 models), or turbocharger boost pressure (2.0T models), and oil temperature information by using details from a center stack multi-gauge cluster. The parking brake lever has also been jazzed up with leather for the leather-equipped models. Engine The 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe will be offered with a choice of two engines: a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged engine and a 3.8-liter V6 engine. The base version delivers a total of 274 HP (a massive 30% increase) at 6000 rpm and 275 lb.-ft. of torque (an impressive 23% increase) at 2,000 RPM. The V6 engine delivers a total of 348 HP at 6,400 RPM and a peak torque of 295 lb.-ft. at 5,300 RPM on premium fuel. The V6 engine will allow the Genesis Coupe to sprint from 0 to 60 mph in the lower 5-second range on its way to an impressive 149 mph electronically-limited top speed. Both engines are mated to standard six-speed manual transmissions which have been extensively refined to provide more driver-friendly shift gating and balanced weighting precision. As an option, Hyundai will also be offering an in-house-developed eight-speed automatic with paddle-shift SHIFTRONIC manual-shifting capability. When Can I Buy One? The 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe will go on sale in March 2012.

While it might sound crazy, you have to admire Hyundais enthusiasm. But its main competitor will remain the Infiniti IPL G Coupe . The 2011 Ford Mustang is powered by an all new aluminum 3.7 Liter six cylinder engine that puts out a total of 305 HP and 280 lb-ft of torque combined with a fuel efficient six speed automatic transmission. The Genesis, of course, will deliver more, but is it enough to convince people that it is better than a Mustang, especially with the strong following the Mustang has? The Infiniti IPL G Coupe is powered by a VQ37HR 3.7-liter V6 engine that delivers a total of 348 HP and 276 lb-ft of torque. It delivers the same amount of power as the Genesis, but you have to admit that the Hyundai does look better.

Thanks Posted on 03.24.2012 InMyOpinion (378) Great that it can offer on the two engine choices like 2.0 L four-cylinder turbo charged engine and a 3.8 L V6 engine. Both engines are capable of bringing a powerful output and higher numbers while driving. Posted on 03.1.2012 RaptorF22 (399) The manual and automatic function is amazing. Its funky rear design attracts me the most, and for a very reasonable price its impressive you can afford this amazing car. Posted on 03.1.2012 Evan_Bruce (502) I love this coupe. The price they are offering was the best at $24,250 up to $34,250. The price was reasonable and affordable. Posted on 02.21.2012 timmyroberts (321) This coupe has a better exterior. The appearance was improved by the grille and air inlets theyve included. The engine was roaring powerful. Its good to know that it will be available with Manual and Automatic. Posted on 02.20.2012 Silver_Lingio (333) Wow! This concept can be both used on manual and automatic one. It truly amazed me most. Im sure that when itll be released, it would come up into good production. Posted on 02.17.2012 Dalia_Pinto (296) This Hyundai Genesis is now oozing with style and appeal. I like the improvements they did on its appearance and engine. Posted on 02.16.2012 lookatmycar (428) Hyundai is as gorgeous as the latest Elantra and Sonata, and I absolutely love the styling of this 2013 Genesis coupé. Who would love to agree? It definitely looks better than the last generation. It has the unique look and the power upgrades. Posted on 02.14.2012 Veyron101 (531) I cant wait to see the final outlook of this car. The engine specs is very efficient making it to go a long way. Posted on 02.6.2012 Empi_rador (473) It has a lot of features especially on the interior. Simplicity with modernity, this is how I will describe that car. The tire is as well good. Posted on 01.26.2012 Soul_Shinobi (595) For this car, it has a look that is so striking on that red body paint. For me Im really dreaming to have this car of mine. Its engine specs is very efficient. Posted on 01.20.2012 LiveLongCoolCar (442) Wow! It looks striking on that red body paint. But to be honest, I am not that impressed on the design of its front hood, it looks bulky to me. I think it will look good on gray body paint. Posted on 01.19.2012 Guglema_Ferrari (224) Im so excited to see the final outlook of this Hyundai model. One good news for this model is that they produces a whole package of a great car. The engine specs is very efficient. Im really dreaming to have this car of mine. Posted on 01.18.2012 Firewoman31 (384) I cant wait too much to see the whole outlook of this model. I think this has a good engine specs and speed performance compared to the other model released. This will be a tough competitor to others. So beware and get ready. Posted on 01.16.2012 Timotea_Bianchi (242) Wow! Hyundai! You the man! Haha. They have produces a whole package of a great car! This coupe has a good engine performance (V6 and 348HP), speed quality given (149 mph), sophisticated exterior looks and huge interior room. Glad to have it for myself. Posted on 01.16.2012 Dalia_Pinto (296) And so do I, I really think that all of us want to know now its price. The interior design is quite cool though similar with other cars. It is impressive with a touch of simple luxury. Posted on 01.13.2012 sioc_tong (446) I agree. This has now a better looks, engine specs and speed performance. The upgrade is really a success. And it is stunning on that body paint, I am now too eager to find out its production price. Posted on 01.12.2012 Timothy_Nives (194) This Coupe looks amazing from side to back, because I am not impressed on its front design. It looks so bulky and wide to me. Anyway, its red body paint suited for its exterior looks. Too bad for the speed of this car is limited only. Posted on 01.12.2012 SmokingTires (419) This model looks awesome on its platform. I love its great interior and exterior design plus the turbocharged engine that has been upgraded to a more precise twin-scroll turbocharger and larger inter cooler.
