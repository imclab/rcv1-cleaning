Excellent value! Easy to use convertible car seat. Durable and washable. Very satisfied, especially with the price. I would recommend this product to a friend.

Share Helpful ( 2 ) Not Helpful ( 1 ) Flag this Review avehonduras Fresno, CA Jan 3 , 2013 via sears.com Overall Cost Effective, Simple & Safe This car seat is perfect for my 1 year old. She was still in an infant seat and she needed an upgrade to accommodate her growth. This seat is spacious and comfortable and has two awesome cup holders for toys and drinks. I especially love this seat because it still reclines when it's rear facing so that when she falls asleep in it, there is no strain on her neck. It goes up to 40 pounds as well, so she will be able to use it for a very long time to come. My only critique is that at least for the rear facing option, it does take a minute to get the seat belt through to buckle it and I feel like it could use some improvements in the ease of installation department. I would recommend this product to a friend.
