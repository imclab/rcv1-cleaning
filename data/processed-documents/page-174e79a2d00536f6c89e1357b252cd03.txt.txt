To assist you, used car price guides are available at libraries or book stores. Also check your local newspaper's automotive advertising section for similar vehicles. It will help you set a fair price based on your local market. You may also want to take your car to a couple of used car lots and see how much they'll offer you.  Prepare your vehicle for resale by having the car cleaned and detailed by a professional detail shop. Having your car cleaned gives you an edge over other vehicles in the market. An attractive car can justify a higher selling price. Also do not make any major repairs. Any major mechanical repairs or body work will almost always cost more than the increase in price you'll get for the car. Instead of spending a lot of money, simply be honest and straightforward in your ad for the car.  Make sure that you always get either cash or a certified check. Do not take any personal checks. If you do not feel comfortable carrying cash you can always go to the bank with the new buyer and make an electronic transfer. Fraud Awareness Vehicle history reports can offer useful information about the car, truck or SUV youĂre looking to purchase.

And just like you would do if you were selling your car to someone outside of a dealership, learning the value of your used car is imperative. This way you have a general price and you won't accept a sometimes deliberately low offer from a dealer. Make sure you factor in features that may positively affect the price, such as air conditioning, sunroof, cd player/changer, power windows, etc. Also be sure to factor in conditions that may adversely affect the price such as high mileage, dull or chipped paint, rust, chipped or pitted glass, worn or stained upholstery and carpeting, worn suspension, poor alignment, etc. These are things that you may consider addressing before trading in the used car.  The trade-in value of a car is basically the amount someone who plans to resell the car will pay it. There are a variety of books available at many banks, libraries and credit unions, as well as online, that can be used as a rough guide to basing a trade-in value. Rough, because there are too many factors to go into pricing a car to print absolute prices for each year, make and model. Time and location are also factors. However, they are difficult to evaluate.  If you can do a few minor repairs without breaking the bank, go for it. It can even add to the value of the used car. However, this matters more when selling the car than it does trading it in. So use your judgment on what is important and what isn't necessary. Remember, some repairs may cost more than what you'll have added onto the wholesale value in the end.  A clean and shiny used car is going to look more attractive, and again, it can't hurt to have it look nice. But a wash and a vacuum will suffice; no need to wax and Armor-all it.
