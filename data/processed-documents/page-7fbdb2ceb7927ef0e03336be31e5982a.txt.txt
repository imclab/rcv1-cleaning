I lived 700 miles away from West Palm Beach and there were other colleges closer to home that could offer me a quality music education. The PBA difference was faculty with a passion for teaching and students with a passion for learning. It takes both to create a strong learning environment. I cannot imagine having gone to school anywhere else. -- Dr. Beth Everett, Assistant Professor, Co-Chair of the Division of Music, Bethel University, McKenzie, Tennessee School of Music  Fine Arts Music Opportunities Ensembles: PBA Symphony Ensembles: Symphonic Band Audition Process Music Audition form Popular Music Scholarships Internships Partnerships International Piano Festival Art Contact Us Dance Faculty Scholarships Opportunities How to Apply Contact Us: Dance Preparatory About Us Stringendo Music Music Curriculum Dance Dance Curriculum Tuition and Fees Application Process Give to PBA Prep Contact Us: Preparatory Performances Venues Facilities Faculty Give to Annual Scholarship Fund  Home About PBA PBA At A Glance President William M.B.
