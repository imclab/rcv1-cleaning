These cars were sold around the globe since the beginning of the automobile. Some of these automobiles may surprise you because some of them are from decades ago and some are still in production. There is no question about the human being having a love affair with the automobile. You will see the amount of vehicles sold and pictures of the vehicles if available. As I put together this section of the 100 best selling cars I questioned some of the numbers and realized that quality or excellence had nothing to do with these numbers. Upon further research of top selling automobiles it was obvious that some of the big numbers were because the model name remained unchanged for many years. This is not a list of most popular, most fuel efficient or the best looking vehicles, its all about the best selling vehicles. One of the top ten best selling vehicles was first produced in 1908 and others were introduced a few years ago. You should remember one thing as you go through this list and that is a best selling car is in no way an indicator of a good used car. It is strictly the 100 best selling cars of all time. Part 2 is linked below.
