Theres a new trend sweeping the social media stream, and its called the hot-dog leg selfie!

The past few months have been filled many ups and several downs at the box office. Like every year, there are the highly-anticipated franchise films and always-talked about but never seen indie flicks. With at least two new films hitting theaters every weekend this summer, it was easy to miss a few. We rounded up the 10 films that you should go back and watch while you still can (or add them to your On Demand watch list).

View Photo Gallery Of course, all the participants in the 2013 VH1 Bikini Awards were sizzling hot and deserving of your votes, but we are both thrilled and a little bit surprised about this years final matchup: model/host/reality TV vet Claudia Jordan vs. actress Olivia Munn .

The movie does a wonderful job exploring the simmering (and sometimes awkward) sexual tension between two brewery co-workers, played by Jake Johnson and Olivia Wilde . All the drunk conversations and inebriated, awkward moments just felt a bit too authentic, too close to conversations weve had after tossing back a pint or 10. And now we know the reason why!

Or George Clooney and Stacy Keibler s breakup?).
