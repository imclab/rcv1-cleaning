Answer You must remove the drive shaft and the complete hub.Take it off the car and the new bearing will need to be pressed in by a machine shop,as the old bearing will need to be pressed out.When the new bearing/hub is ready,install on the car.You need to seperate the upper and lower suspension also.You will need some large sockets as the driveshaft nut is tight.
