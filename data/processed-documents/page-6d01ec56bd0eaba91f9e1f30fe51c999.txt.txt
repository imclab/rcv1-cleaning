He sees the neighbor's kid walk by carrying something big under his arm. Hey boy, whatcha got there? Roll of chicken wire. What you gonna do with that? ... Gonna catch some chickens. You damn fool! You can't catch chickens with chicken wire! The boy just laughs and keeps walking. That evening at sunset, the boy comes walking by, dragging behind him the chicken wire with about 30 chickens caught in it. The next morning, the old man is out watching the sun rise and he sees the boy walk by carrying something in his hand. Hey boy, whatcha got there? Roll of duct tape. What you gonna do with that? Gonna catch me some ducks. You damn fool! You can't catch ducks with duct tape! The boy just laughs and keeps walking.That night around sunset the boy walks by, trailing behind him the unrolled roll of duct tape with about 35 ducks caught in it. The next morning, the old man sees the boy walking by carrying what looks like a long reed with something fuzzy on the end. ''Hey boy, whatcha got there? It's a pussy willow. Wait up kid...I'll get my hat. Monday, May 13, 2013. Sunday, May 12, 2013. Saturday, May 11, 2013. Wednesday, May 8, 2013. Wednesday, May 8, 2013. Monday, May 6, 2013. Sunday, May 5, 2013.

His wife told him to go out and get some of those pills that would help him get an erection. When he came back, he handed her some diet pills. Anyway, he's looking for a place to live. Let me know if you can help. Saturday, April 13, 2013 When triplets Audrey O'Donnell and Alan and Eric Lucas were born in 1933 they were so tiny their chances of survival looked slim. Without the the benefit of today's technology, doctors had predicted their mother Doris may have been carrying twins using an ear trumpet. Audrey was born first weighing 5lb, followed by Alan 20 minutes later weighing 3lb and surprise addition Eric came 20 minutes after that at just 2lb. They were wrapped in cotton wool and cooking foil to keep them warm. But against all the odds, the trio have just celebrated their 80th birthdays, surrounded by many of their 35 grandchildren. They are believed to be among the oldest surviving triplets in the country.     Geezer Planet is brought to you by    Comments, suggestions, whatever?
