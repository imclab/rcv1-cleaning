Did you know In most states it is illegal for an insurance company to steer you to a particular body shop. You can take your vehicle to any body shop of your choice. The insurance company is required by law to writeÂ  a fair and competitive estimate for the repairs. Be aware that when a vehicle has been in an accident, hidden damage may be found during the repair process requiring a supplemental estimate to repair the additional damage. By law, the insurance deductible must be paid to the body shop for vehicle repairs. However, Overall Services may offer a referral fee payable upon completion of repairs and final payment. (Will be negotiated at time of final estimate) Read more about our Albuquerque Collision Repair and Albuquerque Body Shop Read more about our Albuquerque Car Repair Service Before During After  Highest Rated Albuquerque Auto Body Shop Testimonials Find us on Google+ Google - View Our Reviews on Google I got my headlights polished by Wayne - Overall Services.
