She feeds comedy lovers around the globe a steady diet of that trashy humor whenever she takes her comedy shows on the road. Macie brings her shtick to the Tri-Cities on March 7-9 at Jokers on Wellsian Way in Richland. Showtimes are 6:30 and 8:30 p.m. each night except March 7, when there will be one show at 8:30 p.m. Macie, a former East Coast girl who now lives near the beach in the Los Angeles area, told the Herald there is a perfectly good reason she talks trash in her stand-up. "I had a really weird childhood," she said. "My mom drank all the time and collected photos of Michael Bolton. Plus I had an aunt who was crazy, and when my grandma had a stroke, she lost her ability to speak except to crank out swear words all the time." She describes that time in her life as the sea of sadness that led to comedy just to survive. "The only time there was laughter in my house was when I was cracking jokes that made everyone laugh," she said. But there was as much heartache during her school years as there was at home, she said. Her first boyfriend in high school started a nasty rumor about her, which ended up giving her a reputation as a notoriously promiscuous dame. "No truth to his claim when he made it, but there is now," she joked. "I was that girl in high school with the horrible reputation. It might have involved a football team, or a dog, didn't matter. Kids make up all kinds of stories." She speaks out on all kinds of topics that make life interesting, including the mental disabilities of men, the infirmities of women and all that is good, bad and ugly in a world gone mad. "I have learned to channel all the tough times of my youth into a comedy routine where I can change the world by empowering women one weiner at a time," Macie said. And she's been doing just that for more than 10 years, traveling to faraway ports of call entertaining American troops in 12 countries from the Far East to Guantanamo Bay. But before laughter became her paycheck, she gathered comedy intel as a Hooter's waitress, a clown assistant, a telemarketer and a nanny, all of which she claims to have been fired from. She was a finalist on NBC's Last Comic Standing in 2006 and has appeared on E! Entertainment and the Howard Stern radio show, where she was voted the funniest and hottest comedian in America in 2008. She also has toured with the Bob & Tom Show . "Howard Stern is actually very sweet," Macie said. "All the people on his radio show are wonderful." The worst place she ever performed was a place in Texas where the stage was in the middle of a dirt parking lot and the patrons all looked shifty. "I had a sneaking suspicion it was all a front for a crystal meth ring," she joked. "Only good part about that gig was it paid good money." She also admits to being addicted to the TV series The Walking Dead , and her favorite food is "all the ones that make my ass larger," she joked. Macie's show is definitely packed with all kinds of topics, so if you're the least bit sensitive about trash talk, then it might be best to avoid her comedy show. Showtime is 8:30 p.m. each night. Cover is $15. *Dori O'Neal: 582-1514; doneal@tricityherald.com; Twitter: @dorioneal Copyright 2013 . All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
