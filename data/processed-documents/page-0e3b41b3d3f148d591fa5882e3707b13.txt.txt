That's the day their little driving game becomes infinitely cooler with the release of the Legendary Cars pack as downloadable content. Four cars will be available for purchase separately or in a bundle. The one most eagerly anticipated is the Jansen 88 Special , a clever nod to the DeLorean used in Back to the Future replete with wheels that turn under the car for hover mode. There's also the Manhattan Spirit that's inspired by the Ecto 1 in Ghostbusters, the Carson Nighthawk that owes KITT a few royalty checks and the Cavalry Bootlegger that pays homage to the original General Lee. Unfortunately, Criterion Games knows which car will be the most popular, and has priced the Jansen 88 Special at $3.99 / 320 credits versus $1.99 / 160 credits for the other three. Or you could save some Microsoft money and buy the whole bundle for $7.99 / 600 credits. UPDATE: Video of gameplay after the jump.

I love some of the car designs (all based on real cars) in fact if I had money ... I'd go design me a couple cars based on game and have them made...

I have that model of the DeLorean Time machine now I can pilot one. Burnout Paradise was the best $20 I ever spent!

February 18 2009 at 6:37 PM Report abuse Permalink rate up rate down Reply 1 reply to Kaveh's comment evilspoons Uhh... Forza 2 has been selling car packs for 18 months now. Project Gotham Racing 3 has paid-for DLC car packs. PGR4 does too. Need for Speed Undercover lets you pay 800 MS points to unlock the exclusive cars from the collector's edition. GRID has extra cars in an 800 point pack. Test Drive Unlimited has a bunch of premium car packs. Shall I go on? We're just incredibly lucky they didn't charge for the first few major upgrades to this game. I'd rather have free huge patches and paid-for trinkets than get left behind everyone else because I don't feel like shelling out $15 every time they add a new feature that you need to play multiplayer.

It looks like it could be based on the Camaro, which is a lot closer to a Firebird than a Mastang February 18 2009 at 5:49 PM Report abuse Permalink rate up rate down Reply 1 reply to Kimura's comment evilspoons They could've easily used a new Camaro on the new (horrible) Knight Rider, but Ford sponsored the show - every bloody vehicle is a Ford product, so of course Knight Rider is going to be a Mustang instead of a Camaro.

I'm getting it especially for the flying dmc12.

They're not the 'actual' cars, they're Burnout-universe spin offs. February 18 2009 at 5:15 PM Report abuse Permalink rate up rate down Reply dinnercoat That DeLorean is pretty sweet lol.
