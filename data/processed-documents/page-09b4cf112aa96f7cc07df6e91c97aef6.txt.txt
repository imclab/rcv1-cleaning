By Khadijah Townsend Balboa Park Beat Contributor The California Roll exhibit in the San Diego Automotive Museum shows how much cars have changed since they were first invented. The exhibit highlights how the California customizers had a major influence on how the cars of the 1930s and beyond were made. The cars in the exhibit stand out because they are brightly colored and have different body shapes than many cars today. The first car that caught my eye was this orange 1951 Mercury called the “Lead Sled” with brownish colored interior. The car has a small amount of space in comparison to its large body. The other car that stood out in the exhibit was a blue hippie bus. The hippie bus had pictures of some of the most influential music people at the time. Artists are airbrushed on the bus alongside images of other objects. This exhibition does an excellent job of highlighting how different cars look today than they did before. The California Roll exhibition is open until January 30, 2011 at the San Diego Automotive Museum in Balboa Park. Khadijah Townsend, a junior at High Tech High Media Arts, is interning at the Balboa Park Online Collaborative this month. She is excited to explore the park and learn more about what the museums have to offer. In her free time, Khadijah enjoys cheering, dancing, and hanging out with friends. Her long-term plan is to become a reconstructive plastic surgeon or a sports broadcast journalist.
