The Applause cover is very artsy, and Gagas entire face is painted. Her eyes appear to be painted as tidal waves and her mouth as fire. I cant help but think it looks like Gaga is being born in this photo. Heh. ARTPOP will be Lady Gagas third studio album. It hits shelves on November 11, 2013. Do you think ARTPOP will live up to her first two albums?
