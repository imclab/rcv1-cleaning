Purchasing a used vehicle can get anxious byes to purchase from an emotional basis as opposed to a sound mechanical basis. We all tend to pay close attention to the cosmetic side of the purchase but we can miss mechanical and safety issues during our test drive and visual inspection. This can be a costly mistake! Consider a pre-purchase inspection before you sign that deal. We will perform a mechanical and safety inspection by our certified mechanics that are knowledgeable with the make and model of the car you are considering buying. The intent of this inspection is to uncover existing conditions or reveal maintenance issues that can cost you plenty after the deal is closed. This is particularly necessary when purchasing a car AS IS and without a warranty or when the car is located in another city and you are purchasing without seeing it and test driving it first. At Car  Doctor Auto Center , we offer competitive  pricing on all types of tires, including Uniroyal, Michelin, Kelly,  Dunlop, and BF Goodrich tires. We also accept all major credit cards.  Have one of our professionals help you pick the right type of tire for  your specific driving needs.
