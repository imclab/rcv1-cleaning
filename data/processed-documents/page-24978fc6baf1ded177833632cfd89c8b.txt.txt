Genuine Spicer automotive driveshafts and components are available for automotive applications, including passenger cars and light trucks. Because Spicer parts are manufactured to the same standards as original equipment parts, you can count on them to meet or exceed OE performance. That is because Dana never stops innovating and never stops raising its standards. Specifically designed to meet the needs of your car, Spicer driveshaft assemblies are engineered for reduced weight and built to minimize noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) that can impede your vehicle’s performance. Dana also manufactures universal joints featuring the Spicer brand, and they deliver maximum life, including the premium Spicer Life Series® universal joints, which use our highest quality, triple-lip seal and external seal guard to resist the harshest conditions. Add in Spicer end yokes, which you can count on to deliver the same levels of quality and reliability that you expect from your original equipment parts, and keep it all together with bearing strap and u-bolt kits that ensure that your u-joints and end yokes stay secure.
