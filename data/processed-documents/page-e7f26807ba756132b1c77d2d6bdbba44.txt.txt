Criticism runs high against the salesman and dealer, but how about dishonest customers? Many times I have seen cars traded in with bald-headed tires, switched after the car was appraised with good tires; spare wheels missing, radios taken out and cheap batteries replacing new ones; heavy oil in engines to cut out noise--just to mention a few. Customers also lie about car condition, their credit and the competition's prices. They get the best cash price and then expect retail for their car. Then they forget all the good things done for them by a dealer when they get ready to trade--will drive a hundred miles to save $50, then expect the local dealer to give them service under warranty. I had one expect me to buy white-wall tires off his car, purchased from another dealer, because he had a set in his garage. RAYMOND E.
