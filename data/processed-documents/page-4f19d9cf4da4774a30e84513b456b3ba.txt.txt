  Home Home Images Images Contact Us Contact Us Home Gary and Terry Cross started our auto body collision repair business in a garage at their parents house. Later, their brother Craig Cross joined the business and he brought the idea of adding towing to the services that we offer. Due to the quality of our work, and word of mouth, the business soon outgrew the garage and we moved just down the road from our original location to a bigger shop. Since then, we have grown even more! We now have 13 full time employees and 8 tow trucks, ranging from light duty towing to flatbed services, and even a light heavy duty wrecker. However, we still offer the same family oriented service that you have come to know and expect. In 2006 we celebrating our 30th year in business. Please call or stop by today and see why we were voted the best automotive service facility by readers of the Edwardsville Suburban Journals in 2005. Services offered: Auto body repair and painting, Mechanical repair- everything from oil changes to engine replacement, Roadside assistance- tire changes, jumpstarts, lockouts, and towing.
