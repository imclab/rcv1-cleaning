Just a Coupe... And some colors to look at...  Last edited by MonaroSS; 04-04-2012 at 06:39 AM .

Haha, you clearly used your Australian colour palette, and not the GM North America 'Any Shade of Beige' version! I like all except the green. But your powers are being wasted on colour changes! You should be working on a photochop or two... I'm thinking wagon and coupe... It's been swell, but the swelling's gone down.

Based on this alone, I'd put you in charge of Chevy styling. I love colors. What the hell is with the all these cars, in any color you want, as long as it's some variant of gray? I hate that. Gray, graphite, slate, rain or whatever else they want to call it. If it's not a gray, it's a bronze variant. Boring. I wish they'd build a coupe other than Camaro/Corvette.

I don't like the SS font you used. How about putting the prancing Implala on the grille? The Coupe looks surprisingly good.

I like these renders a lot. http://www.gmaccessorieszone.com I find it sad that some people wish for GM to fail and can't comprehend any good news. A plausible explanation for this kind of behavior is that you have a miserable life so you wish the same to others. Cory Pham, Autoblog Poster GM must return its divisions to being interdependent entities within the corporation. Decentralize and free the different divisions talents to foster brand differentiation and customer loyalty.
