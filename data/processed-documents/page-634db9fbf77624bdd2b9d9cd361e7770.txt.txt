Students participating in the Patterns Differentiated Curriculum Kit will experience activities that will help organize their thought processes throughout life. Students will become pattern detectives, pattern creators, and pattern solvers in this three-part series. The books in Prufrock's new Differentiated Curriculum Kits employ a differentiated, integrated curriculum based on broad themes. This all-in-one curriculum helps teachers save planning time, ensure compliance with national standards, and most importantly, pique their students' natural excitement and interest in discovery. By participating in the wide variety of activities in the Differentiated Curriculum Kit for Grade 1, students will discover the patterns around them and gain a lifelong desire to learn. In Patterns Book 1: Literature, Arts, and Science, students will become pattern detectives as they search and document patterns in their environment. Rhythm and rhyme are explored in poetry, music, and games. Familiar stories with predictable outcomes are dramatized and extended. Story plots are examined in relation to beginning, middle, and end. Students will also develop their own games with the use of patterns. Mother nature is also explained in a study of weather, seasons, and animal migration. Curiosity is encouraged as students record their detective pattern clues in a journal that will be stamped Case Closed at the conclusion of this book. Each book contains detailed lesson plans, reproducible activity sheets, and assessment tools.
