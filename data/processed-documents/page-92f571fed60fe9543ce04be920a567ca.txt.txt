Banksy tags Detroit with Eco message -- The internationally famous mystery artist known only as Banksy is notorious for tagging famous locations with important political and socially relevant messages. His most recent work is a mural painted on a wall at an abandoned auto plant in Motor City, Michigan. He left his mark on a piece of the now empty Packard plant in Detroit. However, the bigger news than what he actually painted on the wall is that art thieves stole the piece. They removed the entire wall and relocated it to their own art gallery, claiming they were preserving it. [May 15 -- Report + Photos + History of Packard Factory ] BANKSY TAGS MOTOR CITY WITH GREEN CAR MESSAGE Exotic car owners are typically avid collectors of more than cars . Most will tell you they are also patrons of the arts as well as appreciating the aesthetics of autos. It very rare to meet an exotic car owner who is not well educated or at the very least worldly. That's why many may already know about the graffiti artist known only as Banksy. Banksy has tagged many of the world's most famous cities from Los Angeles to London with his world class art murals. He never shows his face or lets anyone knkow who he is or what he has doing. He simply choses a location and proceeds to leave his graphic art with a political statement. Banksy has left his mark so well in the art realm that pieces of his illegal works actually are going as museum quality work for more than a million dollars. That's why when he tagged a crumbling wall of the Packard plant in Detroit, Michigan with the image of a young black boy painting a message on the ruins saying, "I remember when this was all trees..." the green news note struck such a deep chord with so many local residents. Well -- that is, it could have, until art thieves claiming they were protecting the piece showed up less than 5 hours after it appeared with excavating equipment and stole the wall before it could be seen by anybody. Packard Auto Industrial Complex Drawing circa 1907 (credit: All Posters) The Packard plant in Detroit, Michigan today -- photo of the Banksy graffiti mural by Detroit Funk. HISTORY OF THE PACKARD AUTO PLANT The Packard auto plant is a sign from history about the rise of the auto industrialist giants and their current financial ruin as much or more than the impact automobiles have had on the city of Detroit in general. Before the "Banksy Leaves His Mark in Detroit" story broke, Jalopnik took a look back at the famous property and said: Packard moved out 50 years ago, after their merger with Studebaker. But the headquarters and plant in Detroit still stand. The city calls the site, with its proximity to rail, ripe for redevelopment, but mostly, it just sits forlornly with a total of twelve employees to fill its nearly 4 million square feet of space. Meanwhile, the City's laid claim to the site, but is tied up in court with others who claim to own the property. When we see stuff like this, it genuinely bums us out, as Detroit has some truly amazing buildings that are ripe for urban renewal. Meanwhile, they sit unoccupied and crumbling. The Packard Motor Car manufacturing complex was first built on the Detroit east-side as a star property location back in 1907. Packard, an auto giant of the day, manufactured luxury vehicles for a newly mobile American population until it succumbed to pressures from competitors like Ford and General Motors [GM]. The auto maker went out of business in 1956, leaving its colossal 40 plus acre complex vacant. The real estate parcel with its abandoned buildings was sold for a paltry $750,000 the following year, and since that time has fallen into complete ruins. Back in the day, a Packard was considered very high tech.

BANKSY SENDS MESSAGE TO AMERICAN AUTO GIANTS -- CLEAN UP NOW AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR PAST HISTORY As a political statement about the auto industry, the message from Banksy to return Detroit to its former pre-automobile glory is a poignant one. So, too, is a hope that tying green news with green cars movements to be part of the industrial fabric of the global future will be the result of Banksy's tag on Motor City. With all American car companies either in bankruptcy or decline in the past decades and Detroit itself in such deep need of urban renewal projects, will the message be sent to American industrial giants and political leaders that it's time to rehab and renovate both Detroit as well as the concept cars we send to auto shows? In a post-modern era where car companies like Ferrari and Lamborghini are finally getting smart and announcing that they are ready to design new green exotic cars for the future car market, the world teeters on the brink of embracing green car technology. With American sports car and exotic car makes like Fisker, Tesla Motors, and Scorpion putting forward electric and hydrogen concept cars and bringing them to production for the common market, somehow 2010 has not felt quite so hopeless. Even the Chevy Volt and the Ford hybrid vehicles have given inspiration to the American auto buying public -- but the state of decay left in the world by past failures of industrialists are still spurring criticism by global figures like Banksy for our national failure to preserve and protect or to move forward fast enough to correct the environmental damages cause by our history of automobiles as an industrial giant. What do YOU think -- should the art wall been left in its original surrounding as a message to clean up the architectural ruins surrounding it? What responsibility do car companies have to preserve and protect the environment -- if any? Sound off in the comments section below.
