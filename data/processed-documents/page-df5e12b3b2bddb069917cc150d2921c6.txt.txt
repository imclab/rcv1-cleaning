Photos: Authors born in New Jersey The cover is torn and the pages discolored, but Rachel Braun Scherl's first-edition, paperback copy of "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret" is a treasured possession. Braun Scherl had the beloved Judy Blume novel tucked away safely in her purse on Monday night in Paramus as she watched "Tiger Eyes," the first feature film of a Blume book, which officially opens Friday. The details "Tiger Eyes," starring Willa Holland , is opening Friday at AMC Empire 25, 234 W. 42nd St., Manhattan, on video on demand and on iTunes. For more information, see tigereyesmovie.com . At the New York Film Critics Series screening at Westfield Garden State Plaza, Blume spoke about her "nostalgia readers," as the iconic writer calls the 20- to 50-year-old women who grew up reading her books. Braun Scherl is part of that group, for whom Blume was an integral part of childhood and adolescence. "She's like a friend you never met," said the South Orange resident, who waited after the QA to meet Blume. "You knew her well but didn't know her at all." Braun Scherl had actually already met Blume, 38 years ago. As a 10-year-old at the same sleepaway camp in Massachusetts as Blume's daughter, Braun Scherl ended up quarantined  alone with the chicken pox and her copy of "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret." When Blume heard a fan was sick and stuck alone in the infirmary, she went and said hello and signed the girl's book. On Monday she signed it again, much to the fan's delight. As young girls, Braun Scherl and her friends felt as if Blume wrote just for them, just as they feel this movie is meant for them more so than today's teenagers. "To me, I thought it was 100 percent for me," Braun Scherl said. Blume, born and raised in Elizabeth, agrees. She did this movie for the women who write to her regularly about the impact she had on them when they were girls passing around dog-eared copies of "Forever" after spending their younger years reading "Freckle Juice," "Blubber" and the "Fudge" series. Her son Lawrence, who directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with his mother, did not create the movie with the same demographic in mind. "This is essentially written for teenagers; the theme of loss and discovery are universal, but this is a book for young adults," said Lawrence, talking about the movie's teenage issues of going to a new school in a new town. "I have to make a movie, I'm making a movie for teenage girls  and boys hopefully." It is one of the few conversations during the collaboration where Judy and Lawrence did not agree and never found common ground. "I still think I'm right," Judy said after the Paramus screening. Much to the disappointment of many Blume fans, "Tiger Eyes" is a limited release; the closest theater to North Jersey showing it is the AMC Empire at 42nd Street in Times Square. (The Blumes, along with star Amy Jo Johnson, will be there opening night for a QA following the 7 p.m. showing.) The only New Jersey theater showing it is in Cherry Hill.
