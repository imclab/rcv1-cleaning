We carry Asanti, Swiss, Modular Society and many other wheel / rims. Asanti Wheels This section is for people that want to purchase new Asanti Wheels Advan Racing Cast and forged wheels by Yokohama AVS Advance Vehicle System wheels by Yokohama Lexani Wheels This Section is for people who want to purchase new Lexani Wheels Volks Xreutzer Series by Yokohama Wheel Design Work Many often wonder what makes WORK Wheels so strong? WORK focuses much of its technology in rim forming. Our rim barrel is what really sets us apart. Many companies focus on the phrase “Forged”, but that only pertains to the center disk construction. The rim barrel is what takes most of the load of the vehicle; having a forged center disk with spun rim barrel really doesn’t make much difference in the strength (this applies to two and three piece construction wheels). WORK Wheels is one of the only companies in the world to develop and utilize a “Solid Rim Flange.” Our rim barrels are highly regarded by other wheel manufacturers as well. Many other wheel makers have requested to purchase our rim barrels for their wheels. The photo is a cut-away view of our two piece rim barrel. As you can see the rim flange is solid and our barrel thickness is thicker than most of our competitors. HRE Racing defines HRE. Racing is our test center. We race to continually push ourselves to develop a stronger, stiffer, lighter wheel for next season; which translates into the finest wheels you can buy for the street. Every wheel at HRE has motorsport in its soul and undergoes the same type of rigorous development, whether it is winning races or cruising down the boulevard. We aren’t just racing for fun or fame.
