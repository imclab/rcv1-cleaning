From 1/11/2013: This 1971 Fiat 124 Coupe (chassis 124BC10141107) was purchased by the seller back in 2005 to use for track days and auto-cross meets. It had spent many years as an SCCA ITC class race car on the East Coast and included logbooks, but was bruised and banged up. The seller wanted the car to look nice, so in 2006 he stripped the body, cut out rust, welded in metal and fixed minor dents(pictures below). Since then, the car has numerous auto-cross wins to its credit. On its most recent track day outing at VIR it took two first place awards, one for instructor in vintage class, and one for intermediate driver in vintage class. We like how this seller has done his own work and built an interesting and unusual car for a modest amount of cash. Wed enter this in the California Melee exactly as it sits. It is available in Winchester, Virginia for $7000. This is exactly what we would do with a 124 coupe modify it for enjoyable use. There are not many good ones out there because restoration costs are usually far beyond value, so most are tattered stockers with rust. This one bucks that trend, and we love the look with bumpers deleted, especially with that custom inlet beneath the grille. The seller nailed the ride height and the 14-inch Falken/Panasport is perfectly selected 15s would look too modern and 13s or stock wheels always look a little weak. The exterior was painted with a PPG base/clear and the result is a very nice looking driver. The front end and leading edge of the hood are wrapped with 3M paint protection film to protect the paint on the track. Stock bumpers are also included. The car came with a full SCCA cage, but the seller cut the front bars out to ease entry for track days. The cage pieces and window net come with the car so that they could be welded back in if the car goes racing again. To cut down on weight, he replaced the side and rear windows with Lexan. All windows still function like factory, and the original glass goes with the car in case the next owner prefers originality. The windshield is clear and good. He added a passenger seat with harness so he could take friends along on track day rides. Stock seats and interior pieces are included if the next owner wants to put a stock interior back in the car, but they will need re-covering. The seller sprayed the engine compartment, interior, and trunk in white, and it remains clean as shown. When purchased the car had a 1.8L engine, but he swapped that out for a 2.0L with a slightly shaved 1.8L head. It has been updated to electronic ignition and runs a 4-into-2 exhaust manifold. He says it runs very well.  The car has a welded differential, but comes with an open one as well if the next owner wants to switch it back. The car comes with a clear Maryland title, and could be registered and tagged for the street again if the next owner desired. Unfortunately, the seller now only sees about two events per year, so he has decided to send it on to its next caretaker.

It looks great  bumpers should stay off, wheel/tire package is just right, prep seems thoughtful and complete but not big-dollar fussy. It oughta run strong based on work done, so whats left to worry about? Its particularly nice that this wasnt a typical rip-and-tear makeover; the key original bits go along and most of the changes are reversible. But why would anyone want to do that? Nice offering. It could be a load of good times for a modest investment. Mark_S January 11, 2013 at 5:16 am 1 or Flag as not constructive with addition of a fuel cell this would by a very pretty and unique entry for vintage racing. I would like to see it running with us in VSCDA in our B Sedan series. Pinarello January 11, 2013 at 5:18 am 2 or Flag as not constructive Whats not to like here? StephanP January 11, 2013 at 5:21 am 0 or Flag as not constructive The 124 Coupe is the only car I regret selling. Bat forgot to mention the perfect side marker lights, you cant improve on that design. CSC January 11, 2013 at 5:22 am 1 or Flag as not constructive Genuine 4 wheeled fun for less than the cost of a 200k mile Civic. WINNING! Kristoj January 11, 2013 at 5:29 am 2 or Flag as not constructive Cant say I would have done anything differently here. The Fiat 124 Coupe is a seriously underrated car, and I like what the owner has done here to turn it into a competitive budget vintage racer. Seems to be reasonably priced as well. Im not sure how you can go wrong on this one. Affenschmidt January 11, 2013 at 5:29 am 8 or Flag as not constructive Heh. I grew up near Winchester and saw Farm Use tags on some surprising vehicles, but this one, as they say, takes the cake Pinarello January 11, 2013 at 5:56 am 8 or Flag as not constructive @Affenschmidt  Maybe hes plowed up some infields with it. Gordini January 11, 2013 at 6:05 am 3 or Flag as not constructive Me, Id put the bumpers back on, and the seats, and some carpet, and drive it on the street again. Not an original color, but it looks good, Id leave it. These Fiat Coupes are almost as fun as a Fiat Dino at 1/3 the price. Unlike the Dino, the engines are simple and parts are inexpensive. In stock form, they are a bit on the refined side, so this one being in more raw form doubles the fun. Always liked the BC coupe styling too. Lorenzo January 11, 2013 at 6:15 am 0 or Flag as not constructive this pushes all my buttons. perfect in every way  only thing I would change is the color of the interior to grey and exterior to grey also. love everything about this, model, year, level of execution. I pray some day I could build one just like it. If I can only find a clean 124 coupe to start. Damn, why did I have to start that Bugeye project.. amazing. Affenschmidt January 11, 2013 at 6:20 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Pinarello: could behe sure couldnt fit more than one straw bale in that trunk (maybe two with the lid open). Gordini January 11, 2013 at 6:23 am 3 or Flag as not constructive @StephanP  Agreed those are the best side marker lights ever (similar to, if not the same as, what Alfa used), however they are from a 1969 AC coupe. Looks like the original inset 1971 side markers were shaved. Konrad January 11, 2013 at 6:26 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Nice. It will sell today. Tirefriar January 11, 2013 at 6:28 am 1 or Flag as not constructive One of the best offerings on BaT in a while. Everything is right including the price. Buyer wins! Geoffrey Isabelle January 11, 2013 at 6:44 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Lovely car! Its very Dino Coupe-esque in the front and I love how clean and tidy it is all around. Its nice to see someone enthusiastically care for an underdog. mike January 11, 2013 at 6:49 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Im an MG guy, but I always loved these. Great looks ! Don in CT January 11, 2013 at 6:51 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Nice car, nice price. Im with Mark. Add a fuel cell and put the bars back in and be ready for April 13/14 at VIR. A reasonable way to get into vintage racing. LS1RX7owen January 11, 2013 at 6:53 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Wow I dont think I have ever seen this model or bodystyle before, or I just never took notice. This one on those wheels, set up the way it is for that price, I am in love! Great car and I bet it is gobs of fun on track/on course doing what it does best. Kudos to the seller for the fun and purposeful build. Great feature BaT Thomas Potts January 11, 2013 at 7:15 am 1 or Flag as not constructive I had 2 of these coupes back in the day and loved them. Im always looking for ones to relive my youth, but as noted they are rare as hens teeth. For a similar experience Im now in a 74 2002tii with a stroker motor and metric mechanic head, but this car would be a blast to play with and Im thinking about it hard. Im sure someone will realize the value here and scarf it up. Greg S January 11, 2013 at 7:18 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Id be surprised if he didnt run dual 40 or 44IDFs on the track. Too bad that set up doesnt come with the car but Ive seen a few out there lately for sale. I currently have a 73 under cover thats waiting for me to put some time into. Soon I hope. nigel prodrive January 11, 2013 at 7:35 am 1 or Flag as not constructive Cutting out half of a perfectly good and logbooked cage to ease entry for track days seems all backwards. (This is assuming cage was indeed perfectly good of course). So now we have a car suited to cone-bashing and the occasional gentlemens track daywhere once there was a battle-tested warrior, theres now a weekend warrior that can be driven to the grocery store or local car shows. But its still too loud and bouncy to have the Missus come along willingly. Dont get me wrong, I like this Fiata lot. But sometimes its just hard to discern what wuz he thinkin? Jason A January 11, 2013 at 7:42 am 0 or Flag as not constructive If I were still living in NoVA Id be all over this. Blasting through the climbing esses at VIR or the carousel at Shenandoah would be a hoot and a half, and way cooler than the typical Miata / BMW you usually see. DomOh January 11, 2013 at 7:48 am 0 or Flag as not constructive @GordiniDefinitely Carello side markers from an AC. Also used on some pre 1970 Italian exotics. From personal experience, amber ones harder to find than the red. Owning a both a 69 AC and an AS I have my own personal stash. Nice shade of blue. Almost French blue. CCi January 11, 2013 at 7:54 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Gorgeous example of a 124 BC. The 124 Sport Coupe is likely the most under appreciated car on the planet. In the day, I would be likely to bet it could have changed Trans Am history as we know it if the factory had pushed development, like it did on its rally championship winning stablemate the 124 Spider. Gordini January 11, 2013 at 7:58 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Ill bet the amber ones are harder to find because the early cars (1968) used only the red rear marker, nothing on the front. Im going by memory here..I sold my 68 in 2003. RC January 11, 2013 at 8:03 am 1 or Flag as not constructive Very modern cars equipment-wise for the era. DOHC engine, five-speed, four wheel disk brakes. And a great Dinoesqe shape. Incidentally, while prices are quite recessed in the US, they do quite well in Germany, Netherlands and Australia. They have quite the cult following, with really nice examples breaking the US $10K or more mark. jboat49 January 11, 2013 at 8:21 am 1 or Flag as not constructive Ive been at this for a number of years, and my antenna is pretty sharp. There is NOTHING that smells funny about this car or the seller. And to assume that there is, simply because theres a funky plate on the car is just, well, ridiculous. Did it ever occur to any of our registration vigilantes that this might just be the sellers personal joke? Let it alone. If it is a felonious act, its his ticket, not yours. If the titles clear, and I have no doubt that everything is in good order here, and he signs it over properly, you dont inherit any of his woes. So un-knot your knickers, lads. jboat49 January 11, 2013 at 8:24 am 0 or Flag as not constructive PS He might also flat-tow it to events, as Ive done many times. In some states, including a couple Ive lived in, you can register a car for flat towing by using junk or farm plates. No need to go for a full vehicle registration as long as its towing-only. nigel prodrive January 11, 2013 at 8:31 am 1 or Flag as not constructive @ CDN Stig: re-reading my post, I can see where yer question comes from. Lets just say she doesnt think much of loud bouncy cars. She refuses to call my Hella-bedecked, skidplated, road-rally-prepped Subaru 2.5RS by his proper name Snowball and instead dismisses him as The Skateboard. redstack January 11, 2013 at 8:32 am 0 or Flag as not constructive I had a buddy who had one. I remember he drove it like a rally racer in downtown Seattle. Ive always wanted one since then. 124 Coupe lover January 11, 2013 at 9:04 am 1 or Flag as not constructive Oh, my God people! The tag is supposed to be a joke. You know: funny, humor, hahahaget it??? You are getting bent out of shape over a joke. Havent you ever seen any other jokes on the back of track/race cars? bringatrailer January 11, 2013 at 9:08 am 2 or Flag as not constructive Hey all, We asked the seller about the rear plate and he explains that it is only on there for a good laugh. The car isnt driven on the street. Weve removed a couple farm-related comments with worries that could have been avoided if we had included this info from the start. Thanks for paying such close attention, and for all the great comments as usual! BaT tirefriar January 11, 2013 at 9:22 am 0 or Flag as not constructive this whole farm issue is another reason why one shouldnt ASSUME anything because it can make an ASS out of U and ME If there questions or doubts, just ask the owner directly. Thanks BaT Gordini January 11, 2013 at 9:22 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Leave it to BaT commenters to quibble over something as trivial as a license plate, lol. Ok, now back to the car.. Nachtblau968 January 11, 2013 at 9:26 am 0 or Flag as not constructive What a nice car. I bought one of these new in 1971. It was a great car, very easy to work on and there were plenty of after market parts you could add if you wanted to upgrade form the stock 95 bhp the US version made. The european version of this car came with a pair of 2 barrel Webber side draft carbs. Abarth offered this set-up along with a lower restriction exhaust system as well as many other performance items for these cars. I added the european carb set up and a low restriction exhaust, Koni shocks and beefier sway bars. Like any performance oriented car of that era, you did have stay on top of the maintenance, the most difficult of which were the valve adjustments. To do it yourself, you had to have access to a collection of various sized shims in order to do the adjustment properly. Valve adjustments were the only thing that I ever took the car in for. It would be fun to have another as a weekend toy, but alas they were very prone to rust and the few Ive seen offered were in a sad state. BTW, I think the side markers on this are from a 69. The body style changed to what you see here in 1970, I believe. My 71 had sunken rectangular side markers, but the 69s had bullet type markers similar to this cars. Ed L January 11, 2013 at 9:38 am 1 or Flag as not constructive Seems a like a lot of value for the money. Its caught in between track and street at the moment, but could (relatively) easily updated to current track spec, or even more easily fitted with some sound matting, carpets (or rubber mats), and resonator as a terrific event/road car. You could even register it in California Kev January 11, 2013 at 10:03 am 0 or Flag as not constructive I also had a 1971, back around 1974. A fantastic fun car with a rev happy engine, nice handling, and good looks. Interior materials.eh. Would buy another in a heartbeat. Don in CT January 11, 2013 at 10:06 am 0 or Flag as not constructive nice car, cheap.someone buy it and come racing! The Original Alan January 11, 2013 at 10:12 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Neat car, but it looks as if your legs would need to comprise 80% of your bodys length in order to drive it. Will Owen January 11, 2013 at 10:15 am 3 or Flag as not constructive Theres no comment I can make except that I would give up every Alfa in my garage if I could have this. Its not even my favorite 124 coupe  thats the earlier single-headlight version  but this is so well-planned (if you want a streetable track car, which I do) and perfectly executed. Ive dreamed about doing a similar conversion on several cars, from Alfa GTV to early Falcon, and this guy did it much better than I ever could. Bravo! austinalfa January 11, 2013 at 10:17 am 0 or Flag as not constructive great little cars! My college roommate had onemy first Fiat experience. Fun, thrifty and his was reliable. CC in Southern California January 11, 2013 at 10:17 am 2 or Flag as not constructive Hi guys, I used to run the 124 Sport Coupe Registry before I handed it over to Rob up in Vancouver. I can tell you Coupes are exceedingly rare. From the early internet days of 1996 to my hand-off in 2007, I was able to track down just under 300 124 Coupes in something like 21 countries. I can confirm quite a few exchanged hands for over the $10K mark. A nice 1968 124 AC, displayed at the Best of France and Italy, was sold on the spot to a collector in Mexico back in 2007. That sale also exceeded $10K. As for the rust issue that always comes up, Coupes rust no more or less than other cars of that era with minimal factory rust proofing. These cars are highly under appreciated. For a look at a few really nice Coupes, check out: http://www.fiat124sportcoupe.com/ Cheers, Cesare Frank Barrett January 11, 2013 at 10:19 am 6 or Flag as not constructive If BaT had a bang-for-the-buck meter, this car would peg it.

I still have a bunch of new amber button lights from some restorations I did in the 90s. If only time and money was more plentiful now vinniem January 11, 2013 at 10:56 am 0 or Flag as not constructive I have a 67/68 parts car. (dont know what year due to lack of any official papers)- the side markers are amber front and rear. My 69 driver has amber front and red rear. Dr Randy January 11, 2013 at 10:57 am 0 or Flag as not constructive I really really really want to see that farm. Crossroads January 11, 2013 at 11:01 am 0 or Flag as not constructive The car has a welded differential, but comes with an open one as well if the next owner wants to switch it back. Yeah, youre going to want to do that. A differential allows the wheels to turn at different rates around a corner, welding them forces them to turn at the same rate, which is bad. Around a turn the wheels have different distances to travel from each other. So he turned his differential into a spool, which is fine for drag racing only. I imagine the axle shafts are pretty twisted and fatigued by now if he was autocrossing the car with a welded differential. Massive fail here. Walter Gomez January 11, 2013 at 11:07 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Great cars! I would get rid of the Eighties flag mirrors and replace them with Vitaloni Sebring mirrors which look great on these Boano designed cars. The engine compartment looks like it could use a little detailing such as cleaning out the coolant overflow. A good college friend of mine in the Seventies had a white 71 too, which he lowered, had the stock 13 inch steel wheels widened to 7 inches and installed the then new B.F. Goodrich Radial T/As on. It looked great, and and seemed to handle great too! He kept the stock bumpers but had the over riders removed which really cleaned both the front and rear end up. Pinarello January 11, 2013 at 11:20 am 6 or Flag as not constructive While a LSD might be preferred on a race car there is no problem running a welded rear (I had one). I also knew other racers and autocrossers on a budget who did the same. Not good for low speed maneuverability and the locked rear increases understeer, but it was easily dialed out with some pretty simple chassis tuning. Were I considering any street duty for this Fiat the welded rear would be the first thing to go. Someone please buy this thing before I do. Carl January 11, 2013 at 11:58 am 0 or Flag as not constructive The seller is a very good friend of mine and probably the nicest guy you will ever meet. He has several coupes in perfect condition, he knows his Fiats. The Farm tag is great, I had to borrow it from him to drive a track day Milano home when my spider blew a headgasket, Doug Milota January 11, 2013 at 12:21 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive I see Spiders all the time around here - its refreshing to see a coupe. One of the cars Id have a hard time passing up,if a nice one came along for a good price.  Doug AbarthBill January 11, 2013 at 1:24 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive With so many comments from people who bought one new, Fiat must have a sold a huge number. I bought a 71 new, traded in a 64 Elan. Crossroads: I road raced in the 60s and 70 and many cars raced with a locked rearend before limited slip diffs became available. Stopped the spinning of the unloaded inside rear wheel. gpzkat January 11, 2013 at 1:32 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive Ive owned four BC coupes and always loved the fact that they are under-appreciated, thanks to the fix it again Tony attitude. Last one I owned was voted cleanest/most original at Best of France and Italy back in the 90s. I bought it for $2,500 from a 90+ year old Italian guy that owned since new. The interior was perfect in tan, body had no rust, mechanically it was very sound. What a fun car. I had 2 of them that past the 200k miles mark, with only a top end refresh. And like others, yes I regret selling, but I moved overseas and had to. Varjak January 11, 2013 at 1:34 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive I agree with the premise of modifying it for hard use; but I dont much like the overall package. Like Ed often writes (I havent read the comments yet); it might lean too hard on the auto-cross side of the page to be a nice daily driver or much fun off the track. A lot of value in it though for the asking price. Ezekiel January 11, 2013 at 1:52 pm 4 or Flag as not constructive No PTO. No hydraulics. mike January 11, 2013 at 1:58 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive nice to see a coupe..love the color and bumperless lookbut those seats have got to go. Thomas Potts January 11, 2013 at 2:07 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive @ Abarth Bill, my guess is that most of those old 124 coupe buyers are now BAT readers. Not that they sold so many of them. Does anyone else remember reading a column by Jean Shepherd in an old issue of Car and Driver where he was talking about cruising at night in his 124 coupe? It would have been in 69 or 70. That inspired me to get one in 1970. J.B.

I remember my roommate borrowing it once to drive to a job interview. When he got back, he was absolutely giddy about how much fun that car was to drive. Alas, the rust got that one too. Ftumpch January 11, 2013 at 3:00 pm 3 or Flag as not constructive Wow, its great to see a car thats been built on a budget to such a high standard by someone whos obviously a competent DIYer. This is what the hobby is all about. Great choice of car too. Kudos to the man who owns it, and I only wish I were close enough to justify a closer look. gpzkat January 11, 2013 at 3:07 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive @ Thomas Potts I remember that article, when I was really into the coupes I had a collection of articles that were reprinted into a booklet. It was hard to find info on them and I think I bought the booklet from Bayless. I remember not being able to afford any of the go-fast goodies, or pretty much anything else in those days. If not for the coupes Id have had no sporty car at all. Don Charnetski January 11, 2013 at 4:05 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive Aesthetically very nice! Very little detail was given on the motor, trans and suspension. Depending on what has been done to it and your level of seriousness, one could easily spend $5-$10k or moreway more to make it a competitive vintage racer. But, a nice base to work from. M Peterson January 11, 2013 at 7:21 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive Had a 1970 same color with the shorter stroke 1438cc. Bought used in 75, kept it running for 17 years and 180K with 2 transmissions, 2 paint jobs, 2 interiors, 2 rear diffs, 1 engine rebuild, and full suspension bushings redo. Higher compression pistons, mild cams, and larger carb would twist it to 9000 in first 3 gears. I should have kept it, but rot on inner sill and floorpan braces was emminent in n. california. Loved the mountain foothill roads, but did pay a price.front crossmember fatigue cracked, too tight settings on yellow Koni Sports. Panhard bar on the rear end snapped too due to fatigue, at speed. I still remember the Italian names for color codes on the wiring diagram to this day. Fiat124owner January 11, 2013 at 7:42 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive I am the owner of a 1972 Fiat Coupe. I also have a 1981 Spider and a 1969 600. The coupe is getting a nuts and bolt total resto-mod. It was a SoCal car so not a lot of rust. I still have some modification that have to be done before it is painted. The suspension is being modified to maintain the correct geometry while being lowered with Kings Springs from Australia. Poly bushing fir the control arms. It will get 2liter fitted with a 16 valve head from a Tipo and turbo. Hoping for around 250 horsepower. 15 inch Simmons wheels and all the upgrades in the interior.

My brother still talks about a spirited ride he got in one hitchhiking from Vancouver to Kelowna in the late sixties. Knew a few folks with the Spyders, but I always preferred the Coupe. Cesare, thanks for the link. Had no idea they had become that rare. offroaded January 12, 2013 at 5:59 am 0 or Flag as not constructive Spool isnt drag only. Works great on dirt/sand/snow/ice. Cheaper than a locker but you have to try and be careful.

Varjak January 12, 2013 at 3:40 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive A question for those who might know: How would you compare something like this 124 Coupe to its contemporary the Lancia 2000 HF Coupe? I know theyre significantly different (FWD v. RWD, engine displacement, etc.); but could they be compared for driving entertainment? Art Hughes January 12, 2013 at 5:19 pm 0 or Flag as not constructive The Fiat 124 Coupe and Lancia are like comparing a 70s Chevy, and Oldsmobile. Mechanicals are similar, except for FWD vs RWD. The Fiat cruises well, but is more agile in low speed corners, and easier to go fast speeds, and only dealer AC was offered. The Lancia can be well driven, has more understeer, and cruises more smoothly, and has factory AC standard. I like both, think the Lancia Coupe has impressive styling, and has a more coupe look. The 124 is more like a 2 door sedan, but has classic lines. Same money, would lean toward the Lancia, as age concerns make me want factory AC. For pure sport, 124 hands down. The lighter weight of the 124 overcomes the larger Lancia engine, and the smaller engine produces similar HP of the Lancia 2.0. The 124 with a 2.0 and a 1.8 cyl head, fitted with 1 size larger 2 barrel Weber ( just did one a couple months ago) probably is 20HP of no fuss added power.

My first Fiat was a used White 1969 124 Coupe, which when it was due to be replaced, wife MADE me buy a a new 1973 Dark Blue 124 Coupe, with biscuit interior. 2 of the 22 Fiats Ive owned, which included 2 1973 128SL Coupes. My 73 124 Coupe, with 1608CC twin cam, could run the speedo to 120MPH with me and 2 buds aboard. Did that on the back state routes of Ohio, one night/early AM, coming back from Road America. What a great car, well balanced, good brakes, comfortable, roomy. The 3rd most fav out of 89 cars Ive owned, only surpassed by my 57 210 Chevy Delray, and 1963 Mini Cooper.
