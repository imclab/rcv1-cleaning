Not now. “Implemented when the time is right,” says VW. What they said: The four-seat coupe is based entirely on new technology and concepts. New Compact Coupe is its given name. Really. It’s a full hybrid that reflects the styling of other cars in the VW lineup. The vehicle confirms that VW hybrid vehicles will not only focus on fuel economy, but similar to the brand’s other cars, will also be sporty and fun to drive. What they didn’t say: With a combined number of 45 miles per gallon, the New Compact Coupe doesn’t focus on fuel economy. No range for electric-only driving was offered. While the styling is pleasant, it doesn’t break new ground. It would be a fresh look for a production car, but it’s not the kind of tomorrow imagery we usually see in a concept car. Of course, that suggests that it may well be close to production. What makes it tick? The New Compact Coupe is a parallel hybrid that can run on either a combination of gas-engine and electric power or electric power only. The hybrid system employs a 147-horsepower 1.4-liter TSI engine and 20-kilowatt (or the equivalent of 27 horsepower) electric motor. The concept has a top speed of 141 miles per hour and can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 8.6 seconds when both gas engine and electric motor are engaged. Both are mated to VW’s 7-speed Direct Shift Gearbox. The car can be driven on electric power only. When braking, the electric motor spins backwards and charges the battery. How’s it look? It’s roofline and shape are similar to those of the VW Jetta sedan, but sharp edges, large wheels and a wide grille give it a more aggressive look. The horizontal lines of the grille emphasize the car’s width. While pleasant to look at, it’s conservative enough that it fits comfortably into the current VW lineup.
