With styling and efficiency to match the sedan, the two-door offers a sportier (looking) take on staying compact and green while doing it all on a reasonable budget. A sister car to the 2012 Car of the Year, the Elantra sedan , the Coupe offers the same value, features, and gas mileage, but with a sleeker, sexier look. Wearing the sedan's curves well, but with a fast, flowing roofline, the Coupe might not make as much practical sense, but it's sure to raise heart rates. Despite its reasonable 110.2 cubic feet of interior space and 14.8-cubic-foot trunk, the low rear roofline is likely to make the back seat of the Elantra Coupe a bit confined for adults. Still, it scores an estimated 29 mpg city and 40 mpg highway with the manual transmission (28/39 with the automatic) and can range up to 500 miles on the highway. We'll have the full details on the 2013 Hyundai Elantra Coupe soon. Until then, you can browse the gallery above or find more live Chicago Auto Show coverage at our sister site, Motor Authority.  1,497 Views  Tags: Chicago Auto Show Coupes Live photos Posted in: 2013 Hyundai News Auto Shows Hyundai Elantra News  Advertisement Contribute Send us a tip Comment Contact the editor Follow Us  Get daily e-mail updates GO People Who Read This Article Also Read 2013 Hyundai Elantra Coupe, GT: More High-MPG Compact Models 2013 Hyundai Elantra GT Live At The 2012 Chicago Auto Show 2012 Toyota Prius C: First Drive Report And Full Details Five Things We Don't Like On The 2011 Hyundai Elantra...
