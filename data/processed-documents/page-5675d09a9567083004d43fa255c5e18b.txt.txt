Tuesday, August 27, 2013 Today's Clean Celebrity Joke Learning a Foreign Language Joke provided by MyCleanHumor.org A Swiss man visiting Dallas, Texas pulled up to a corner where two men were waiting to cross the street. Entschuldigung, koennen Sie Deutsch sprechen? he asked. The two Aussies just stared at him. Excusez-moi, parlez vous Francais? he tried. The two continued to stare. Parlare Italiano? Other than a glance at each other, there was still no response. Â¿Hablan ustedes espaol? Still nothing. The Swiss guy gave up and drove off, extremely disgusted. When he was gone, the first Texan turned to the second and said, Yknow, maybe we should learn a foreign language. Why? the other replied. That guy knew four languages, and it didnt do him any good.
