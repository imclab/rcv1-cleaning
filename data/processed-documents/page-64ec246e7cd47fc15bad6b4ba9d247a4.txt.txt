Felt Up Premium Hollywood Raw Meat Ariel Winter is Doing Better Without Her Mom And when I say she is doing well, I mean she is eating well. She is not at ALL fat (so hey, screw you abusive stage mom) but she definitely isn't stick-thin and on the edge of death. (GOOD THING.) According to US Magazine: I had body insecurities when I was younger. I still do. Every girl has insecurities - mine were heightened at the time because my mother wasn't supportive... Now, my sister is always making sure to tell me that I look beautiful... It's about learning to love yourself. Loving yourself is good. Loving willpower is also good, but it's far more important to be happy than to be verbally abused about being fat by your stupid mother. ... okay, well I was going to give credit to myself for thinking of that but I guess it's just common sense. Regardless, good for you AW! RELATED STORIES none 3.27.13 at 02:56 AM Mila Kunis is Another Amazingly Cool Celebrity And you thought Jennifer Lawrence was awesome (she is). Mila Kunis might be the original so-hot-she'll-melt-your-face-off, laid back celebrity. She is smoking hot and although we're docking points for bedding McCauley Caulkin for so long (we assume she hooked up with him when he wasn't strung out and gross), she still wins at life. Watch the video below of her adorable interview for the new Oz movie that's out... you'll fall head over heels for this gorgeous Eastern European beauty.

And it enrages me that anyone would want to harm the eternally nerdy and lovable star. ... the "How I Met Your Mother" actress obtained a temporary restraining order in February against John Hobbs ...who was allegedly sending her harassing messages online, and threatening to kill her. What's worse ... she claims Hobbs was recently discharged from a mental hospital and is mentally unstable. Hannigan was probably more persuasive than she thought ... because Hobbs isnÂt fighting her ... he's agreed to stay at least 100 yards from her and her family for the next 3 years. The only thing I can take away from this is... it's WAY easier than I thought to contact celebrities. Time for this blogger to get a'stalkin!

I don't mind, though. I was starting to gross out my friends and family with how much I talked about Kim's perfect body and why exactly she and I should mate. (It's because we're soulmates.)

Rihanna finally came to her senses and filed a restraining order... but not against who you would think (her physically abusive boyfriend Chris Brown). She filed said order against some random who broke into her house and slept in her bed. Albeit creepy, it is STILL better than punching her repeatedly in the face. In other news, Chris Brown gushed about their undying love to people: Brown told the UK Mirror, "Sometimes you row, you fight, with the one you love and things get said, stuff spirals." He added, "But she loves me - what can I say? I'm forgiven ... but, yes, I worked hard for it." But what can I say? She is a moron.

Instead, she wants to focus on being a business woman and talking about projections and quarterly estimates and if her "dev team is CRUSHING it." Us Weekly reports: Gwyneth Paltrow is giving up showbiz for, well, business. A source says that after the 33 Dias actress wraps her next few films, she will focus on growing her lifestyle website, Goop, and the fitness company she co-owns with trainer Tracy Anderson. (WHAT THE HELL IS GOOP?) Paltrow is hoping to emulate the career of another multitalented star: Jessica Simpson! "She admires JessicaÂs empire," the source says of the Academy Award winner, 40. "She wants to make a killing." So GP wants to be like Jessica Simpson (probably only without the insane weight fluctuations). ... yep, that's definitely the first time anyone has ever thought THAT.
