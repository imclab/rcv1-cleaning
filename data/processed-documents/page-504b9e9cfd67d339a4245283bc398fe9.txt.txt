Join Date Dec 2006 Location Ontario, Canada  I like his first book, yung green nga. I was laughing hard reading it when I was in 2nd year high school and I am 3rd year in college now. It is the best book he had written. Pang masa talaga ang pagkakasulat niya. I want to see his face but sadly it also remains a mystery.

ThereÂs also humor and introspection with remembered details that lead one to believe that he holds the secret of life in the big city, be it in his essays (ÂABaÂ) or in his fiction (ÂAlamatÂ). It is ground-penetrating radar of common sense. That Ong derives his ideas from his life in a self-deprecating and thoughtful manner only means that the secret to Bob OngÂs writing lies in Bob OngÂs being. Most important was OngÂs choice to write in everyday Filipino. ÂConsider language as a tool,Â Ong explains over e-mail. ÂEnglish would be a saw. Filipino, a knife. My aim is just to peel singkamas (turnip) for merienda. A second language can never replace the first.Â Aside from OngÂs own responses, the best information about OngÂor BO as he fondly refers to himselfÂcan be found within the pages of his books. Even at his taleÂs true beginning, it isnÂt a prototypical writerÂs story. Ong didnÂt grow up fancying himself a future author. In fact, he didnÂt enjoy writing as a child nor reading as much as would be expected. After a failed attempt at a college degree, he went on to complete a two-year course in a vocational school and another course in writing. Learning, though, is something he loved. Though not a stereotypical reader, he savored books and TV and found that his daily life gave way to pithy anecdotes brimming with perspective. ÂSome of the stories in my books have been written as early as 1999,Â he explains. ÂI am my writing style. I donÂt write for decoders of treasure maps. IÂm an equal-opportunity writer who wants to be read by anyone who can.Â Ong worked as a web developer and a teacher. And he wrote. His distinctive prose pieces began to be published online, and he put together the first crucial piece in the puzzle: the award-winning Bobong Pinoy website. ÂI created BP because I needed it for my job,Â Ong says. ÂThe twist: although impressed, my boss wouldÂve fired me had he known I was the one behind it.Â In the process of his getting seriously into writing, OngÂs alter-ego was born. He didnÂt coin the name. ÂSomeone else did,Â he says. ÂThat somebody mistook me online for someone by that name. It was a light bulb moment days after when I noticed that the name was actually in ÂBobOng Pinoy.Â No tough decisions there.Â Through his site, Ong gathered fans quickly.

De Vera Inquirer First Posted 07:42am (Mla time) 07/16/2006 Published on page Q1 of the July 16, 2006 issue of the Philippine Daily Inquirer CONSIDER him the mass-market mystery man, a publishing phenomenon whose blockbuster book sales are equaled only by the anonymity he maintains. He is Bob OngÂnot his real nameÂthe most unusual best-selling Filipino author youÂve never met. Here is what can be proven about the enigmatic Mr. Ong: he has written five books, ÂABNKKBSNPLAko?!,Â ÂBakit Baliktad Magbasa ng Libro Ang Mga Pilipino?,Â ÂAng Paboritong Libro ni Hudas,Â ÂAlamat ng GubatÂ and ÂStainless Longganisa,Â all of which have a combined sales of almost a quarter million. His defunct Bobong Pinoy website received a PeopleÂs Choice Philippine Web Award for Weird/Humor in 1998. His books are a favorite among Filipinos of all classes and among studentsÂeven if theyÂre not required reading. He has never appeared at any book launching, not even his own, nor on TV. That Ong has achieved such success in an age when celebrity is often a requisite of effective marketing is indicative of his following. But the fact that he has successfully kept his true identity a secret is even more astounding. ÂEven those who know who he is wonÂt admit that they do,Â says Nida Gatus, OngÂs editor at the publisher Visual Print Enterprises. VPE and Ong himself are fiercely protective of that anonymity. Ong only communicates through the Internet. No phone interviews. No photographs. No personal appearances. Ever. At one time, it was rumored that award-winning poet Paolo Manalo is the real Bob Ong. The literary editor at the Philippines Free Press who teaches literature at the University of the Philippines denies this. ÂIÂm flattered that people think IÂm Bob Ong but IÂm not him,Â he says. Manalo, who actually ran a ÂWho is Bob Ong?Â contest on his blog, offers his view on why Ong is so popular: ÂBob Ong is able to articulate the concerns and attitudes of a generation of students who are aware of the very real and absurd contradictions in the world they live in. He writes with the same casual and ironic tone that made his writings on the old website accessible and popular to Filipino readers. The materials he used in his books are those familiar to this generation of Filipinos. One might even call them urban culture lore.Â Reply With Quote  May 30, 2008 12:48 AM #17 jayjay09 View Profile View Forum Posts View Blog Entries View Articles surviBOY Join Date Feb 2007 Location Blood vs Water  My favorite is MacArthur. I like ABNKKBSNPLAKO. Stainless Longanisa is my least favorite but I learned a lot from it. It helped me decide if I'm going to pursue my course. Ang Alamat ng Gubat at Bakit Baliktad na lang hindi ko nababasa although I had a glimpse in Bakit Baliktad.

Ang cover ng MacArthur book ay inidoro. Hango yun sa MacArthur jargon na yung t.ae bumabalik minsan kahit naiflush na na may koneksyon sa nangyari sa bida sa MacArthur.
