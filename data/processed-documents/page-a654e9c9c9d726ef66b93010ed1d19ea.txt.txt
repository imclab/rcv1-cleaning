But being a fine artist is so much more than going through the motions. It’s about finding your own way of seeing and experiencing the world, and mastering the techniques to share your vision. “After a break of 28 years, I decided to go back to art school. Out of all the art colleges in Colorado, RMCAD appealed to me the most with its size and everything it has to offer. After one visit, I decided that this was the only place I was going to consider studying – and I have loved every class!” – Lara Matthews, 2014 As a Fine Arts major, you'll choose an area of emphasis from specializations including Painting, Sculpture, Photography + Video Art, or Ceramics. Then, you'll work one-on-one with a mentor to design a program of study tailored just for you, your interests, and your desired career path. No two Fine Arts students chart the same course in our program. At RMCAD, you won’t just learn to draw, paint or sculpt. By the time you graduate with your Fine Arts degree, you'll have become an active participant in the world of art. Check out our fine arts classes and explore the many career possibilities below.

The work’s size and the low height at which it is hung, create an experiencethat lingers between an immersive environment and the orthodox viewing of an image hung on a wall. The installationis a synthesis of object and image, and presents an engagement that reflects on the humanistic relation to thelandscape and environment. In this exhibition, artist Lanny DeVuono demonstrates her complex understanding ofour sense of space in relation to two-dimensional surfaces and puts to use many modes of communication, includingcartography, traditional representation of landscape horizons and both historical and current imagery.The Artist: Lanny DeVuono is a Resource Artist at RedLine and the Chair of the Department of Visual Arts at the Universityof Colorado Denver. She has received numerous awards and grants and taught as a Fulbright Scholar in Kerala, India,and as a visiting lecturer in Bangkok, Thailand.Gallery hours for the Rude Gallery are 11 a.m.–4 p.m. Monday–Saturday View Event Exhibition Bruce Price, Forces at Play 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM Wednesday, Sep 4th to Friday, Dec 13th Alumni Gallery Forces at PlayBruce Price, solo exhibition Curated by Cortney Stell Alumni Gallery September 4-December 13, 2013 Opening reception Thursday September 17, 2013, 6-9 p.m.The Exhibition: Forces at Play takes its name from a method of aesthetic knowledge developed through play with prolific productionand ornamental experimentation.

Steele Gallery Daniel Eatock An Empty Room: The SequelSeptember 17-October 10, 2013 Opening reception September 17, 8-10 p.m.Curated by Cortney Stell Philip J. Steele Gallery Gallery Hours:11 a.m.–4 p.m. Monday–Saturday The Exhibition: The exhibition’s title, An Empty Room, is used as an oxymoron. The work explores the very existenceof a room. For a room to exist, it must contain the things that allow it to be defined as a room, suchas walls, ceilings and doors. In An Empty Room: The Sequel, Eatock will react to elements left intactfrom the gallery’s previous installation, the 2013 Summer BFA exhibition. He will apply dynamic,experiential staging of objects, archives and processes to items that are already present at everyexhibition, but often tucked away or hidden in plain sight. By doing so, Eatock will create an awarenessof both the social constructs and physical space of the room. An Empty Room: The Sequel isinspired by an exhibition mounted this past May in Strasbourg, FranceThe Artist: Daniel Eatock is a London-based artist and graphic designer whose work often occupies thethreshold between the two fields. By deliberately working in a query and play-based experimentalprocess, Eatock creates designed solutions through art making. He is a graduate of the Royal Collegeof Art and has worked in design for such clients as Samsung and Channel 4. In 2003, he startedEatock Ltd., through which he builds and maintains his database of photographic projects and completeswork for a range of entertainment and cultural clients.Eatock will also deliver a lecture as part of RMCAD's Visiting Artist, Scholar and Designer (VASD) program. The lecture, titled Subject to Change will examine the medium of the artist/designer lecture format itself. As a hybrid of past research, lecture and performative narrative techniques, Eatock’s lecture will intervene in the traditional lecture structure to address the key questions of producing and framing creative knowledge. Subject to Change will be delivered on Tuesday, September 17. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the lecture begins at 7:00. All VASD lectures are free and open to the public but require a RSVP.
