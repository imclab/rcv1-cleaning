Facebook Twitter StumbleUpon Digg A used car may look perfect, but looks can be deceiving. Caveat emptor  let the buyer beware  is the key to making smart used-car purchases. You dont know whether that beautiful Camaro was once driven by the little old lady from Pasadena or repossessed in a drug raid. All you know is the make, model, what you can determine from any electronic records, and the fact that you like it. This gives the auto dealer an advantage. If you know the law, however, you can protect yourself. Find local businesses for Automobile Sales Definition As-is means just what it says: If you purchase this car, you are purchasing it exactly as it is right now, with no modifications or repairs. You can quickly determine whether a car is being sold as-is by looking at the buyers guide, usually taped to the inside of a window. The As-Is box should be checked. Not every state allows as-is sales; Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and the District of Columbia generally do not allow them. Additionally, Louisiana, New Hampshire and Washington require more disclosures with every sale than a simple as-is. States that honor the as-is clause give you legal recourse if your car has mechanical or other problems. Warning If you purchase a car as-is, youre stuck with all its mechanical problems as soon as you sign the contract. If the dealer made promises to repair or modify anything in your car, he is not obligated to do so unless you included it in writing in the contract. While most states have lemon laws, the as-is caveat renders them more or less void. It also renders any implied warranties worthless. Implied Warranties Two types of implied warranties are the warranty of merchantability and the warranty of fitness to purpose. Both of these implied warranties hold the dealer to a standard of truthfulness. The warranty of merchantability requires that the vehicle sold to you does what it is supposed to do. If it is a car, for instance, it is supposed to run and stop. This limited warranty covers only problems the car has when the seller owned it. If the car breaks down, youll need to prove that the cause existed before you purchased it. A warranty of fitness to purpose requires that the vehicle performs in the way it was promised to. For instance, if the salesperson promised that a lightweight truck would haul your boat trailer and the trailer pulls the back axle off the truck, the truck has failed its warranty of fitness to purpose. You must get promises such as this in writing, however. Dealers vs. Owners Car dealers have much less control over the as-is clause and lemon laws than single owners of vehicles. Most lemon laws do not apply to people who sell fewer than six vehicles a year. This means your legal protections are virtually absent when you purchase a car from its owner. It may be relatively easy, however, to get an owner to promise repairs and other perks in writing. A car dealership may be reluctant to give up its protection under as-is. Protecting Yourself The best way to protect yourself is to get everything in writing. No matter how charming the seller, if you dont know him, you have no reason to trust him. Any promises made regarding the car should be written down on the buyers guide and signed by the seller. You should also get a car history report if possible. While these reports, available through online services, are often incomplete, they can give you an idea of the cars maintenance history, problems, recall notifications and accidents.
