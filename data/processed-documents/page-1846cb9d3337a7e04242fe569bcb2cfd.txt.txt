Surprised? Amanda Bynes has made it absolutely clear that she doesn’t want anyone taking pictures of her, or using pictures of her that were taken before her multiple nose jobs . Basically, she has an aversion to any photos of her that are not “selfies.” But the retired actress , who has been staying at the Revel Hotel in Atlantic City (where she allegedly freaked out on a stranger for taking pictures of her) over the weekend, broke her rule of “no photos” and allowed some fans to take some with her while she relaxed with them in a hot tub. The catch? If she didn’t like how she looked in a photo, she made them delete it. All we can say is, that jacuzzi must have been pretty darn relaxing, because we just can’t imagine Amanda loosening up enough to allow people to take photos with her.  1   1  Photos Via TMZ [if IE 6]>jQuery('.nrelate_default').removeClass('nrelate_default');
