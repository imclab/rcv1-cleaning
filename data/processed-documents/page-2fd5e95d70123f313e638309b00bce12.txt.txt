The direct-injected V-6 from the 2013 Hyundai Genesis sedan is headed to the coupe, possibly bolted to an eight-speed automatic transmission. March 2011 BY  JUSTIN BERKOWITZ MULTIPLE PHOTOGRAPHERS KGP PHOTOGRAPHY AND PATRICK M. HOEY Hyundais Genesis coupe will receive the same 333-hp, 291-lb-ft 3.8-liter V-6 engine that the company recently announced is headed for the Genesis sedan . The revised powerplantwhich features direct injectionoffers a good bump in power over the outgoing V-6 engine, which made 306 hp and 266 lb-ft. At 333 hp, the Genesis coupe will top its six-cylinder pony-car rivals; the Chevy Camaro offers 312 hp, while the Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger each pack 305-hp sixes under their hoods. Although Hyundai will almost definitely continue to offer a traditional six-speed manual gearbox when this engine arrives in the Genesis coupe, the plan for the V-6s two-pedal option isnt yet clear. While the six-speed auto could hang around, the most likely transmission is an eight-speed automatic of the torque-converter variety. Developed in-house by Hyundai, this is the transmission that will be mated to the same V-6 in the Genesis sedan. Based on the heavy use of camouflage in the accompanying spy photos, we also anticipate that a modest cosmetic face lift will arrive at the same time, sharpening the looks of V-6 and four-cylinder Genesis coupe models. (Speaking of which, in spite of the outstanding 274-hp turbo four offered in the Sonata turbo, the four-cylinder Genesis coupe will probably soldier on with its current 210-hp engine.) There is a distinct possibility that this car, seen testing in the snow, is packing all-wheel drive, which company CEO John Krafcik has said is headed for the Genesis coupe at some point. With available all-wheel drive, the more-powerful V-6 engine and a new automatic gearbox on the way, its clear Hyundai wants people to take it seriously in this segment. Its rearming at the right time: In addition to a slew of American rear drivers, the long-baking Subaru/Toyota rear-wheel-drive coupe is just about to come out of the oven. We just hope Hyundai has budgeted some development time to sort out the Genesis coupes tooth-chipping ride.
