Anthony Weiner and his eraser-sized manhood have come up again in the news. He and his wife, Huma Abedi n, recently sat down with People magazine to talk about how great Huma is for sticking by her husband and how he’s such a great guy who did a stupid thing. She may be a pretty intelligent girl when it comes to her job but in her personal life, she’s an idiot. Remember Tiger Wood’s wife, Elin? Now there’s a smart woman. She div orced his cheating behind and took him to the cleaners several times over. She's a role model. Enough of this boo-hoo, my hubby loves me but he had a momentary lapse of judgment crap. If your husband publically humiliates himself like this and makes a complete fool of you and your marriage, you ought to put your big-girl panties on and hit the road. This isn’t the 1900s. The re is absolutely no need to stand by your cheating, philandering, adulterous man. While I’m at it, I wish people would stop making a big deal abo ut Kate Middleton wearing a $78k necklace to some Olympics event. I’ ve said it once and I’ll say it a million times: she’s a princess. If she wants to wallpaper her outhouse with $100 bills or shred $50s to make some papier mache Trojan horse, she can. Don’t we have more important things to worry about? Certainly Fred Willard engaging in lewd acts of self-love at an adult theater is far more entertaining, wouldn’t you say? The 78 year old actor, of movies such as Anchorman, Best in Show, American Wedding and the television show Everybody Loves Raymond was found pleasuring his septuagenarian genitals at the screening of an x-rated movie around 8pm last night. Police arrested the actor but ultimately released him on his own recognizance. It’s been reported that he’s already been fired from PBS because of the ‘uprising’. Finally, I wish people would keep their marital problems to themselves. I’m thinking of Bethenny Frankel who recently discussed that she almost got divorced with her hubby and baby-d addy. She talked about the “strain” and “pressures” on her marriage and how now all she wants to do is be a “housewife.” Gee, I wonder what her husba nd feels a bout her talking like this. If my ot her half decided to publicly broadcast the play by play of our past fights, he would be making fast friends with the couch—permanently. Keep your marital drama to yourse lf people. This includes random posts on Facebook by friends who break-up, make-up and even fight through a divorce, all online. I can’t take it anymore. Everyone has problems in life. Not everyone wants to read the subtitles of your life in live feed. Posted by Socialista at 7/19/2012 2:16 PM | View Comments (1) | Add Comment Some Businesses Should FAIL.
