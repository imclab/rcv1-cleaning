GST students receive a certificate of proficiency.    Career Opportunities  Today's automotive technician is not just a "mechanic." The electronic and mechanical  sophistication of today's vehicles, along with hybrids and full-electric vehicles,  means these jobs are highly technical.    A U.S. Dept of Labor study predicts that need for automotive technicians will continue to grow "even through  downturns in the economy."   The average Automotive Technician salary for the region ranges from $50,000 to $52,000, depending on location and the individual's production abilities.  Often, technicians move into other areas of the automotive industry, including parts, sales, finance and insurance, management, and marketing.    Because the PATC program is so closely tied to the industry, the job-placement rate for PATC graduates is high, approaching 100 percent.    What you need to be accepted into one of the Automotive programs: Instructor permission Valid Driver's License Minimum COMPASS test scores in Pre-Algebra (35-54), Writing (79-100), Reading (85-100) or placement into ENG 101  Automotive Skills tests Proof of insurability Many dealers require drug testing   © 2013 Shoreline Community College• 16101 Greenwood Avenue North•Shoreline, WA 98133-5696 •Tel: 206-546-4101•Fax: 206-546-4630 Map  Directions | Hours of Operation | About | Accreditation | Mission | Privacy  Non-Discrimination | Jobs | Faculty/Staff
