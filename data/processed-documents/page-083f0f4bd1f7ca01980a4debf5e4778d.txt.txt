How does the TCC Rating work? The TCC Rating is a clear numeric rating value based on a 10-point scale that reflects the overall opinion of our automotive experts on any vehicle and rolls up ratings we give each vehicle across sub-categories you care about like performance, safety, styling and more. Our rating also has simple color-coded “ Stop ” (red), “ Caution ” (orange), or “ Go ” (green) messages along with the numerical score so you can easily understand where we stand at a glance. Our automotive experts then also collect and show you what other websites say about these different aspects of any vehicle. We do this leg work for you to simplify your research process.
