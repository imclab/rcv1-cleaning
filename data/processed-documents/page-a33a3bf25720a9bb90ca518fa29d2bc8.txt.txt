Awww! It’s been a big week for One Direction, with a world movie premiere for This Is Us and all, but topping the huge engagement ring that Perrie flashed on the red carpet would be pretty difficult. If we were squealing with excitement when we heard that the engagement was confirmed, we can barely imagine how excited Little Mix and 1D must be. While the engagement was confirmed by Perrie’s mum on Wednesday, Zayn didn't take to Twitter until Friday. It was worth the wait, with his tweet thanking all of the Directioners who have been sharing in his happy news. "Never been more happy in my life!" he tweeted. "Thank you to everyone that has been so lovely about my engagement to my beautiful fiance ! Big love z X." [sic] But that wasn't all, with Perrie also jumping on twitter to spread the love, adding: "I've also never felt so happy! Than you everyone for being so kind and supportive! I'm a lucky girl! Love you all! Perrie <3" They are just too cute! Related video: EXCLUSIVE: One Direction: This Is Us clip.
