The program promotes strong interaction and critical dialogue among all participants, encouraging students to converse in the language of art. Students produce work that reflects their ideas, needs and ambitions, as well as the challenges of the artistic environment and contemporary issues and concerns. Students and faculty alike help determine the direction of the program. Through student exchanges with the Sandberg Institute in Amsterdam, we introduce a broader context. At the same time, our intimate community within the College accurately reflects the real working of the multilayered and diverse art, design and literary worlds, removing the walls between faculty and students. Graduate students are accepted for admission in fall term. Spring admission is on a space-available basis only and arrangements must be made with the Graduate Chair. All named scholarships are awarded by the graduate faculty according to admissions ranking. They do not require a separate application; all accepted applicants are automatically considered. For information on how to apply for other forms of financial aid please contact admissions@otis.edu . Completed MFA application forms and required supporting documents must be on file at the Admissions Office by November 1st. Read the Latest News and Events or the Current Newsletter .
