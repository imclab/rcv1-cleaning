 Auto Otaku: Mike G's Blog February 28, 2012 Japan Through an iPhone - One Ive been home for a week now, dealing first with jetlag and now a pesky cold that was probably brought on by a lack of sleep. Fantastic. Anyway, while in Japan I shot a massive number of photos with my iPhone. The 7d got troublesome to lug around all the time, so I ended up relying on the good old cell phone cam quite a bit. Heres the first batch of iPhone photos I selected randomly. I dont think the results are all too bad really. Used bikes for sale at Up Garage in Tsukuba. Snow. Shot through the Shinkansen window somewhere near Gifu. Crown spotted outside the yakiniku place. Shinjuku on a rainy night. SO Blade Runner. Osakas famous Glico dude. N700. BRZ at the Subaru Showroom in Shinjuku. Damp Yamanote-sen. Partying outside of Universal Studios Japan. Will upload more when I have some time. -Mike Posted at 08:46 PM | Permalink | Comments (36) | TrackBack (0) January 29, 2012 Japan Pics - Round One Well Ive been in Japan for a few days now and thought Id post up a few pictures Ive snapped so far walking around like a tourist nerd.

With all of the buzz about the new Toyota 86 and the Subaru BRZ, as well as the Chevy 130R concept that was shown in Detroit this week - I started doing some thinking. Or should I say, some daydreaming. If the 86/BRZ turns out to be successful, theres a good chance Nissan will want to answer back with an affordable rear-drive car of its own. Many are hoping this new car would be a reborn Silvia to attack the 86 head on - but do you know what might be even better? A revival of the classic Datsun 510. The 510/Bluebird is a car that holds a legendary reputation across the world. A reputation for being inexpensive, practical, and most of all fun. Its also car that proved itself in motorsport when it was new and is still a favorite among grassroots and vintage racers around the world. Imagine the possibilities if Nissan decided to release a small rear-drive car in the vein of the 68-73 510. While the a new 510 probably wouldnt have the same low center of gravity as the purpose-built 86/BRZ it would make up for it in practicality and interior space. Think less sports car and more sports sedan. Im Imagining something roughly the size of a current Honda Civic but with an FR layout. Just like the original, this re-imagined 510 would be available as a four-door sedan. Perfect for those who want a fun, cheap rear-driver but need more interior space than the 86/BRZ and its tiny, backseat offer. The fact that the 86/BRZ are essentially two-seaters is surely something that will keep away buyers who can only have one car in their household. A coupe version could also be available, something that would occupy the spot of the rumored Silvia successor. Perhaps this would take some styling cues from the Bluebird SSS Coupe. Full width rear taillight anyone? At that point, there could also be a five-door hatchback/wagon version. Perfect for those who want maximum utility without sacrificing fun. Sounds like something that would go over well in hatchback-friendly markets like Japan and Europe. For a powerplant, Im imagining maybe an NA direct injected four-cylinder making somewhere in the range of 200 horsepower. Something with a decent torque curve thats still fun to rev out. Itd come with a 6-speed manual as well as some sort of modern automatic box. With the groundwork for the chassis laid, Nissan could also go upmarket with the platform and give Infiniti a nice competitor for the BMW 1-series. Maybe with a bit of forced induction? Like the 86/BRZ, this reborn 510 wouldnt be fast , but it would be plenty of fun. It would also be something you could load up with a few friends or family members and take for a weekend road trip. The target for this car would essentially be the Volkswagen GTI, but with the rear wheels providing the power. Nissan has proven it can play and win in the high end performance market with the GTR. Its also done well with the Fairlady Z. Now, how about something for the little guy? Hey Nissan, Ill be right here waiting for you to hire me so we can get started on this. Who wants one? -Mike  Posted at 04:01 PM | Permalink | Comments (24) | TrackBack (0) January 06, 2012 D1SL Levin Taken at Tsukuba Circuit in December 08.
