Tess Brickley 15, Commonwealth Honors College classics major is working with digital archaeological materials from the Pompeii Quadriporticus Project under the supervision of Professor Eric Poehler . Brickley so impressed Poehler as a freshman in his Roman archeology class that he offered her a research assistant position. Tess has truly excelled in every task she has been given. One of the first was analyzing data from 74 columns in our building, the Quadriporticus at Pompeii, and discovering patterns within the hundreds of holes cut into those columns. Thinking through the process of the task I gave her was itself challenging, but then visualizing the results was especially impressive. I presented the results at a major international conference in January to great interest, says Poehler. 2013 Distinguished Alumni Awards The Alumni Association's 2013 Distinguished Alumni Awards was a wonderful event that had over 200 guests in attendedance.
