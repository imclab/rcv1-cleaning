View Larger The Bill Hicks concert film ‘Bill Hicks: Relentless’ comes to ND on Tuesday for Free Film Tuesdays.  By Dale Roe  American-Statesman Staff  Fall is full of big names and odd comic events. Let’s take a look at October’s top Austin comedy events: ‘Bill Hicks: Relentless’ Tuesday Free Film Tuesdays at ND features a Bill Hicks concert filmed during the 1991 Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal. The comics’ comic spits hilarious and venom-tipped pitchforks at war, smoking, drugs, sex and religion, but the common thread is hypocrisy, which he did not suffer gladly. Birds Barbershop provides free Shiner beer and Tamale Molly offers food specials. Host Eric Harrelson performs a pre-film set. 8 p.m. ND, 501 N. Interstate 35. Free. 485-3001, www.ndvenue.com . Jeff Garlin Oct. 13 It’s crazy to me that people still say, “Jeff who?” when I mention this comic’s name. I guess he’s one of those guys who you recognize when you see but don’t put the face with the name. Garlin is probably best known for portraying Larry David’s manager on HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” but he’s a film veteran too — he voiced the ship captain in Pixar’s “Wall-E” and co-starred with Eddie Murphy in “Daddy Day Care.” A Second City veteran, Garlin sports an average guy persona and a self-deprecating storytelling style. 7 p.m. Stateside at the Paramount, 713 Congress Ave. $28. 474-1221, www.austintheatre.org . Mortified Austin Oct. 19 You know all those embarrassing love letters, poems and short stories you wrote during your angst-y teen years and shoved into the shoe box that’s collecting dust in the back of your closet? Imagine the hilarity and horrific level of, well, mortification you’d experience reading them to a room full of strangers and you’ve got a handle on “Mortified,” a performance art movement crossing the country. Come watch your friends and neighbors (including Austinites Christian Ryan Criswell, Monica Armendariz and Meg Greene) hop in the time machine and give you a peekaboo at their twisted and dramatic pubescent psyches. 8 p.m. 29th Street Ballroom at Spider House, 2906 Fruth St. $12. 480-9562, www.spiderhousecafe.com . Capitol Steps Oct. 25 It’s true, the Capitol Steps are lampooned almost as much as they, themselves, lampoon, but there’s a reason they remain popular after 30 years and some 30 albums. The equal opportunity offenders have taken on all political comers with song parodies such as “Love Potion 9-9-9” (Herman Cain), “Help Me, Romney” (Mitt) and “You Can’t Hide This Biden Guy” (Joe, by way of the Eagles). 7:30 p.m. Dell Hall at the Long Center for the Performing Arts, 701 W. Riverside Drive. $24-$54. 474-5664, www.thelongcenter.org . Brian Posehn Oct. 25-27 I first saw Posehn on HBO’s “Mr. Show with Bob and David,” where the hulking, nasal-voiced comic was equally comfortable playing heavy metal headbangers and a variety of distinct nerds and geeks. He went on to appear in a number of network sitcoms and alternative cable comedy series including “Aqua Teen Hunger Force,” “Tom Goes to the Mayor” and “Reno, 911.” A member of the Comedians of Comedy Tour that rolled through Austin years back with Patton Oswalt, Zach Galifianakis and Maria Bamford, Posehn possesses a crude but endearing odd-man-out comic style. Various times, Cap City Comedy Club, 8120 Research Blvd., No. 100. $17-$21. 467-2333, www.capcitycomedy.com . A Pre-election Roast with The Onion Oct. 26 Have you ever wondered what it’s like to be in the writers room of the hilarious faux-news institution? With campaign season in full-swing, it’s the perfect time to watch The Onion folks peel back layers of political hypocrisy, live. 8 p.m. The Paramount Theatre, 713 Congress Ave. $40-$70. 474-1221, www.austintheatre.org . Bill Cosby Oct. 28 The words “legend” and “institution” get thrown around too much but, come on … this is Cos. From live stand-up to best-selling albums to books, movies and television (remember “The Cosby Show,” anybody?) the comic continues to entertain audiences 50 years into his career. 6:30 and 9:30 p.m. Bass Concert Hall, 2350 Robert Dedman Drive. $22.25-$52.50. 477-6060, www.texasperformingarts.org . Gallagher Oct. 28 I remember how, years ago when I worked backstage at a suburban Chicago performing arts center, we would spread yards of clear plastic sheeting in front of the orchestra pit so that the first 10 rows or so could pull it over their heads when the Sledge-o-matic made its appearance. Luckily for the maintenance crew at the One World, there will be neither watermelons nor sledgehammers at this stand-up-only appearance. 7 p.m. One World Theatre, 7701 Bee Cave Road. $50-$65. 330-9500, www.oneworldtheatre.org .
