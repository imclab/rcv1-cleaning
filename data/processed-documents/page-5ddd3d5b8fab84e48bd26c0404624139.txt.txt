The C63 AMG Black Series Coupe has an impressive design, luxurious appearance and good performance with advanced safety features. In terms of popularity and engine power, this vehicle can hardly be beaten. To add a little more flavor and twist, Superior Automotive Design made modifications to this heavy duty 336 kW (457 hp) model.
