I've watched The Philadelphia Story with friends around my age, and I was laughing for half the movie and they thought I was crazy.  10-03-2012, 09:48 AM Icy Tea 9,421 posts, read 5,640,360 times Reputation: 4373  I listen to When radio Was every Sunday night on my local AM radio station. Some of those shows are comedy gold. Phil Harris, Jack Benny, the voice charicatures of Mel Blanc, and some early Lucille Ball.Edgar Bergen and Charley McCarty. OthersIi have a hard time listening to. Red Skelton has the same bits over and over and I don't find any of them very funny. Then there's one with some hayseed woman running a hotel, Mel Blanc does voices on that one. She's not funny. The worst was Lum and Abner, pure death and enough to make you change the station.  10-03-2012, 06:00 PM LIGuy1202 Location: Nesconset, NY 1,096 posts, read 737,180 times Reputation: 783  Who's On First is great...seen it so many times I think I know it by heart.
