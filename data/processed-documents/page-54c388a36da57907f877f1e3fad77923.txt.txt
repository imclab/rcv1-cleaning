Mercedes-Benz to unveil Concept Style Coupe at Auto China 2012  Posted By: Sonia Renthlei | Apr 19 2012 With an attempt to recovering the position it previously lost to competitors Audi and BMW, Germany-based Mercedes-Benz is looking to introduce its new concept, the CSC, better known as the Concept Style Coupe, at the upcoming Auto China 2012 to be held in Beijing. The Concept Style Coupe is Mercedes-Benzâs answer to BMWâs 1-series and 3-series as well as Audiâs A3 and A4. Based on Mercedesâ new stretched version of the MFA platform, the CSC is a fusion of the Concept A and the F800 Style Concept.

For now, not much is known about the Concept Style Coupe aside from the fact that it will be sharing the same 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that the A-Class is using, capable of producing 208 horsepower. However, vehicles coming out of the production line will offer a range of gasoline and diesel engine alternatives to customers. Like the A-Class, the CSC sacrifices space for style although it boasts a graceful exterior dominated by lines. The tail and nose of the car drops away from the massive passenger compartment. The Concept Style Coupe shares many other similarities with the A-Class such as curved headlamps and the stylized metallic looking grille. As per speculations, the interiors will probably feature tons of suede accents coupled with modern styling which will offer a radical change from the classic Mercedes style. The CSC will also be installed with carbon fiber and neon green air vents which will give the car an alien craft-like sensation, and white and gray seats which will match the rest of the interior cabin. Manufacturers also hinted that the Concept Style Coupeâs future models will offer consumers the four-door sloping shape. The CSC is anticipated to hit showrooms by early 2013 and will also be the first compact offering in the United States by Mercedes-Benz.
