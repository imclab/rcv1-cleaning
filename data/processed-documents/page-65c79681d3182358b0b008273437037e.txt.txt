By Mama bear from White Lake, MI About Me First Time Parent Pros Comfortable Easy to Adjust Easy to install Lightweight Safe Sturdy Cons Best Uses Infants Toddlers Comments about Safety 1st onSide Air Convertible Infant Car Seat - Bedrock Brown : When my daughter was about 9 months old, we ditched her old car seat and got her this car seat. I was looking for a safe car seat that was also comfortable for my daughter (she hated the car). I've had this car seat now for 6 months and I love it. We have installed it rear and front facing without any problems and my daughter seems to enjoy car rides a lot more now! Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend Was this review helpful?

By Tom from Miami, FL About Me Grandparent Pros Safe Cons Difficult To Adjust Best Uses Infants Toddlers Comments about Safety 1st onSide Air Convertible Infant Car Seat - Bedrock Brown : Seems safe and sturdy, however difficult to install rear facing. We bought some additional hardware to be able to hook the back of the seat to keep it from moving around. When front facing, it is easier to install.
