But once the movie started and I figured out that Jamie Foxx was indeed playing the role of a slave, the movie began to pique my interest. The movie is the story of a slave named Django , who basically assists a bounty-hunter to gain his freedom. Because there is a host of popular African American and Caucasian actors and actresses, this movie is somewhat funny, but it is also very serious. This movie has its humorous moments, and it has its moments when you as the watcher get to really see the pain endured by African Americans. It’s a movie that I’d recommend to a friend.
