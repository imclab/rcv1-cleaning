Glasscock, 26, a post-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Wollongong in Dubai, has spent a lifetime fascinated by things that get hot. "As a child I loved to switch on the electric fire just to watch it glow and get hot," he explained. http://EzineArticles.com/7904410 http://EzineArticles.com/7904410 Thu, 08 Aug 2013 16:04:41 -0500 Gardening in a woodland location is complicated by deer who love to chomp on tender flower and vegetable gardens.

Weight and body oppression is oppressive to everyone. When you live in a society that says that one kind of body is bad and other is good, those with "good" bodies constantly fear that their bodies will go "bad". http://EzineArticles.com/7885480 http://EzineArticles.com/7885480 Tue, 06 Aug 2013 14:25:53 -0500 Andorra is a principality located between France and Spain. It is also a favorite among Lithuanian tourist seeking really good cuisine and Ukrainian tourists (very recently) who went there thinking that Andorra was really Pandora from the Movie, Avatar. Ultimately the Lithuanians were happy, but the Ukrainians were bitterly disappointed. What follows are the 10 most interesting and surprising facts about the Tiny nation of Andorra... http://EzineArticles.com/7912085 http://EzineArticles.com/7912085 Mon, 05 Aug 2013 16:26:51 -0500 Find out what causes the sound effects in the theater in this roll-on-the-floor comedy.

I have seen him at several stops on his various tours. You may or may not think you're like him but, once you get to know him, you'll see there's a little bit of Jim Gaffigan in all of us. http://EzineArticles.com/7871711 http://EzineArticles.com/7871711 Thu, 18 Jul 2013 07:30:53 -0500 My dentist is hilarious and maybe that is the method to his madness.

Many parents still remember and love the 80s. It was the time of movie creation, music creation and an embodiment of the creative movement. The only way to get your kids to understand reality is by watching The Termination. Not that one, the one with Arnold Schwarzenegger. http://EzineArticles.com/7839335 http://EzineArticles.com/7839335 Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:16:41 -0500 The technique to learn standup comedy lies in the way you observe things. Always try to find humor in everything you do, the people you meet, the TV shows you watch etc. Don't be an introvert. Communicate as much as you can with different types of people and gauge on the fact as what can hit their funny bone. http://EzineArticles.com/7834328 http://EzineArticles.com/7834328 Thu, 04 Jul 2013 11:33:55 -0500 The oldest written comedy was written by a dramatist of the ancient Greek theater, Aristophanes. He wrote 40 comedies, and 11 of them are still being performed today.

Grasping your head, your jaw drops. Disbelief has just tainted the evening. Relax bud, it's not the actor's fault, we promise. It's those darn pesky writers.

For years I have had the opportunity to commute in the not so wonderful, but definitely wacky world of rush-hour traffic. Want to know what a person is really like? Watch them behind the wheel of a car as their normally hidden psychopathologies emerge like Dracula from a coffin. I have noticed that there are a typical cast of characters on the freeway during rush hour. The cars and people may vary, but the behaviors are the same all contributing to the driving experience. This essay is a tongue-in-cheek look at six types of drivers I am sure you will recognize: Mario Weaver, Fastlane Freddie, Roger Roadrage, Sally Slowmo, Conrad Convoy, and Don Cruise (me making fun of myself). Add some fun to your next commute by seeing how many you can identify among the other drivers around you. http://EzineArticles.com/7764653 http://EzineArticles.com/7764653 Wed, 19 Jun 2013 15:01:43 -0500 Why did they have the dowry?

Here is a story on how not to get caught up in other peoples problems. http://EzineArticles.com/7791122 http://EzineArticles.com/7791122 Mon, 17 Jun 2013 10:30:16 -0500 Writers write and they never run out of ideas because there are so many things to write about in our great universe. And there are so many ways to approach a subject. You can be serious or not. You can write factually or factitiously. You can be an essayist or a poet. It is all up to you in your little world. Here are some books I never got around to writing. Sincerely, Taylor Jones, the Hack Writer. http://EzineArticles.com/7776470 http://EzineArticles.com/7776470 Fri, 14 Jun 2013 10:08:02 -0500 Exploring the typical goings on in a village near you. In a 'Bridget-Jones'-style persona, I explore the hilarities and humbling nature of typical village life in England, the good and the bad. Enjoy! http://EzineArticles.com/7779852 http://EzineArticles.com/7779852 Tue, 11 Jun 2013 07:00:18 -0500 The worst can happen and the best can happen, but whatever happens, I am cool. To be flexible, is not to be idiotically bendable and breakable.

This is a direct quote from Brad Pitt. But I'm going to talk about them, for just this one instance... because it's important that everyone knows these secrets. I mean, everyone knows them, of course... that's why everyone does them, but just in case, under the bizarre circumstance that someone didn't know one of these rules, I think it's best that we talk about them just this once. That way no one has an unfair advantage over anyone else in the game of life. (Like the time that paraplegic was allowed to run in the Olympics against those "non-prosthetic-legged" people... so unfair.) http://EzineArticles.com/7747218 http://EzineArticles.com/7747218 Tue, 04 Jun 2013 11:57:52 -0500 Why do you think men open doors for women?

It describes my various futile attempts to find a solution, and how I cope with this situation. http://EzineArticles.com/7729770 http://EzineArticles.com/7729770 Tue, 28 May 2013 09:04:39 -0500 When it comes to good manners both the English and Frenchman in me are equally convinced that in a civilized society generally-agreed codes of respect and consideration towards others - especially when strangers or barely known - are vital in reducing the risk of conflict or offence in the requests, agreements, refusals, apologies, greetings and partings which are so much a part of our everyday lives. Both are also not without knowing that polite behaviour consists in maintaining a fine balance between showing you think well of others, and not giving others the impression you think too well of yourself... http://EzineArticles.com/7745560 http://EzineArticles.com/7745560 Sun, 26 May 2013 23:41:46 -0500 The other day someone told me I should run for the local City Council. I laughed at them profusely. They told me that I could do a very good job. That quite frankly it's BS, because the way I see it all of these City Council people, County Commissioners, State Representatives, and even members of Congress sit in committees, forums, and legislative groups all day long making more rules and regulations. http://EzineArticles.com/7695647 http://EzineArticles.com/7695647 Fri, 24 May 2013 13:52:30 -0500 When I was nine years old, I attempted to make my own doll with an empty bottle of Lemon Fresh Joy and some spare Barbie body parts. My attempt was not a smashing success. http://EzineArticles.com/7737378 http://EzineArticles.com/7737378 Thu, 23 May 2013 15:24:40 -0500 When I was young, I had asked our mother, "Does dogma mean bitch?" She got upset, slapped me, and sent me to my room, saying that I was a bad boy. And as I sat sobbing on the bed, Comedy came to console me and said, "Dogma does not mean bitch, however people do bitch about each other's dogma. http://EzineArticles.com/7738436 http://EzineArticles.com/7738436 Thu, 23 May 2013 07:42:57 -0500 Sometimes, I feel like drinking or smoking, but I do not do it. I cannot escape my problems with it or solve them. Dull my senses or temporarily escape? Maybe. But when I get sober, the problems are even worse. So, what is the point? http://EzineArticles.com/7687652 http://EzineArticles.com/7687652 Wed, 15 May 2013 10:52:07 -0500 There is a light at the end of the homeless tunnel. Everything that is experienced can be experienced with joy and laughter and real, true appreciation. Don't overstay the welcome. Buy a postcard every now-and-again and send it to your hosts letting them know you are well, and what you are up to, and what your plans are for the future. http://EzineArticles.com/7668110 http://EzineArticles.com/7668110 Wed, 01 May 2013 14:27:02 -0500 I know how hard it is for people to write short stories. I have been writing for many years now and my favorite genre is comedy. This article is to provide some helpful hints and tips on how to start a short story. http://EzineArticles.com/7670824 http://EzineArticles.com/7670824 Fri, 26 Apr 2013 08:46:50 -0500 Who hasn't laughed at one of the most famous sketches in the history of British television comedy, the 'Dead Parrot Sketch' from Monty Python's Flying Circus? Well, one person comes to mind. A rival political party had adopted the image of a bird for its logo. Margaret Thatcher's speech writers encouraged her to quote from the dead parrot sketch to lampoon her rivals. This she did do at the party conference. But the story goes that she had been initially reluctant to use it because she just hadn't found it funny. The sketch illustrates one common element in comedy which is delight at feeling superior to others, like when we laugh at their misfortunes or shortcomings in contrast to ourselves -- like seeing someone hoodwinked by a pet salesman. The question arises whether laughing at the misfortunes of others is a good thing to do. Is all laughter healthy? http://EzineArticles.com/7647536 http://EzineArticles.com/7647536 Wed, 24 Apr 2013 15:58:38 -0500 Meeting famous actors and musicians was part of my job at the recording studio in Hollywood.

Often times, natural comedic abilities are hindered by nervousness and the anxiety of facing strangers. Walking yourself through the initial steps of preparation will help to make your first steps toward that solitary microphone a more successful endeavor. http://EzineArticles.com/7613582 http://EzineArticles.com/7613582 Tue, 09 Apr 2013 11:52:45 -0500 Performing corporate comedy is often the next step a successful "club comedian" chooses in advancing his or her career. Corporate comedy often allows a comedian to be the keynote performer on larger stages for businesses, conferences and church events. These singular venues offer greater recognition, excellent networking avenues and of course a bigger paycheck. The secret to performing a successful corporate show is achieving the same intimate relationship with a large audience that is achieved through a successful performance at the comedy club level. There are ways to achieve this intimacy and the professional corporate comedian uses them with fun and finesse. http://EzineArticles.com/7597415 http://EzineArticles.com/7597415 Mon, 08 Apr 2013 11:31:18 -0500 Going on a Silent Retreat is all fun and games until someone loses an eye.

The acrylic paintings are very chickeny, especially the ones of me. I'll tell you about my best, human friend, Jillian, and my chicken family's Hatch Day party and that sometimes everybody has fun except the Birthday Bird! I pecked a tiny piece of birthday cake so I wouldn't hurt Jillian's feelings, but then I got hungrier and hungrier, but I didn't die. http://EzineArticles.com/7600732 http://EzineArticles.com/7600732 Thu, 04 Apr 2013 10:54:40 -0500 If you are entering the world of stand up comedy, you will need an arsenal of jokes to keep your audience entertained.

New talents yearn to be in the spotlight. For this reason, supply often exceeds demand. The years of learning and sacrifice produce a pauper's paycheck. The advice "keep your day job" should be taken seriously until reaching a point where the income is semi-predictable and hopefully steady. http://EzineArticles.com/7595738 http://EzineArticles.com/7595738 Wed, 03 Apr 2013 08:35:24 -0500 Scene: in the interrogation room Ear Man (EM) is sitting across the table from the Police Commissioner (PC).

Relatively an unknown author today, he inspired comedians such as Groucho Marx and Jack Benny into fits of laughter. Who could make such comic geniuses laugh until their sides hurt? I call him the funniest man in the world and for a ten year period in the early twentieth century he was. His works are still able to make you cry in hysterics to this day. http://EzineArticles.com/7532862 http://EzineArticles.com/7532862 Tue, 12 Mar 2013 08:34:00 -0500 In contrast to the more formal French approach, the English concept of 'friendly' politeness requires us to address people we've never met in our life before in the most familiar of terms. Only the other day, for example, I walked into a small shop in England where I was instantly greeted by a lady assistant, young enough to be my grand-daughter, and whom I'd never clapped eyes on before, with a cheery 'Hello, young man!' This welcome smacked so much of inappropriate familiarity that I felt compelled to react by firmly pointing out that, since she would never have addressed... http://EzineArticles.com/7523531 http://EzineArticles.com/7523531 Thu, 07 Mar 2013 14:56:34 -0600 We're probably all familiar with the mythology of The Creation as outlined in the Book of Genesis: chapters 1 and 2.

Here are some hilarious predictions for the new year covering everything from Anonymous, North Korea, and LOL Cats. http://EzineArticles.com/7461047 http://EzineArticles.com/7461047 Mon, 14 Jan 2013 14:50:50 -0600 A government spokesperson has predicted that World War Three will be fought and won from a laptop in a bedroom in Glasgow. This follows an earlier report in the Daily Telegraph's website /news on 9/1/13, in which the Commons Defence Committee warned a shocked and armchair-bound nation that, "The armed forces are now so dependent on information technology that their ability to operate could be 'fatally compromised' by a sustained cyber attack." http://EzineArticles.com/7443094 http://EzineArticles.com/7443094 Mon, 07 Jan 2013 11:53:04 -0600 The importance of ignorant people is as significant as the intelligent ones to create an economy of ideas that could be traded everywhere like universities, night clubs and bars. You need the entire community to spread your ideas and thoughts to reach that rewarding state of enrichment and knowing that you have reached someone and made a difference in their life. http://EzineArticles.com/7437398 http://EzineArticles.com/7437398 Wed, 02 Jan 2013 14:48:19 -0600 Sometimes the best gifts are the ones that are least expected, though usually for a gift to be appreciated it also has to be useful or specifically desired by the recipient. Gag gifts manage to transcend these constraints; though they are usually unexpected, they have little utility outside of their novelty. You could say that a gag gift is greater than the some of its parts, and that their value is essentially sentimental. http://EzineArticles.com/7435985 http://EzineArticles.com/7435985 Mon, 31 Dec 2012 14:06:43 -0600 Some believed that December 21, 2012 would mark the end of the world due to the conclusion of the 5,125-year cycle in the Maya calendar. It gave me pause to think about the Mayans and their ability to create a calendar with that type of duration to begin with. I am not sure, but I don't think my iCal goes that far into the future so to think that a Mayan person 5,125 years ago, painstakingly created a calendar to last 5,125 years (equal to 615,000 months or 266,500 weeks or approximately 1,870,625 days) is pretty amazing and most likely accounts for why the calendar maker stopped after a certain point. Here is one improvisor's take on what could have happened... http://EzineArticles.com/7438706 http://EzineArticles.com/7438706 Thu, 27 Dec 2012 14:44:05 -0600 Friends, it's time for grandmas everywhere to rise up in righteous wrath over the song "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer". Elmo and friends have been singing this song for far too long, besmirching the reputation of grandmas everywhere. Now, while many grandmas want to show their compassion to hapless reindeer, elves, Santa, and children everywhere, it's actually grandpas, who behind the scenes, have banded together to show Elmo he doesn't know everything. http://EzineArticles.com/7361186 http://EzineArticles.com/7361186 Thu, 27 Dec 2012 10:41:37 -0600 Somebody complained the other day in a letter to the editor in a local newspaper that you couldn't press a flower between the pages of an eBook. While I sympathize with his basic sentiment, I think you indeed can press a flower with an eBook and in this article a propose a procedure which you probably won't want to try. This article is an ode to paper and its nostalgia, particular when it is used to make a book. http://EzineArticles.com/7420487 http://EzineArticles.com/7420487 Wed, 19 Dec 2012 10:37:36 -0600 Laughing away your distress, stress, pain, sorrows and thoughts is a natural process which changes the mood of a man and brings about piece of mind and relaxation. Studies so far have shown that laughter can relieve pain, bring greater happiness and even increase immunity and protect your heart from harm. http://EzineArticles.com/7420867 http://EzineArticles.com/7420867 Wed, 19 Dec 2012 09:38:18 -0600 There are many types of humor: slapstick, situational, grim, self-deprecating, silly, serious, raw, light hearted, visual, plays on words and rhymes, and on and on. The one thing that most humor has in common is 'the unexpected'. Dorothy Parker's humor was certainly the unexpected. She played off of each situation and said or wrote exactly what she was 'thinking' - particularly if it was 'out of the box' of social propriety. Her words were quick, biting and unexpected - eliciting genuine laughter, and perhaps nervous laughter as well. http://EzineArticles.com/7415669 http://EzineArticles.com/7415669 Tue, 18 Dec 2012 15:38:00 -0600 Most people today never heard of Dorothy Parker, yet in her day she was known first as a humorist and later in life as a social advocate. She supported the cause of the Republicans during the Spanish civil war, was a founding member of the Writers Guild of America, wrote many screenplays, was a heralded, best selling author, and in 1967 left her twenty thousand dollar estate to Martin Luther King. But it was her early participation in the Algonquin Round Table where she found her fame. Her wit and humor found fertile ground in the wounds of a war weary nation and the emotional fatigue of her citizens. Following WWI, the people were looking for something different and they found it in Dorothy Parker. http://EzineArticles.com/7414614 http://EzineArticles.com/7414614 Fri, 14 Dec 2012 17:27:38 -0600 Christmas is a time to enjoy ourselves to the hilt.
