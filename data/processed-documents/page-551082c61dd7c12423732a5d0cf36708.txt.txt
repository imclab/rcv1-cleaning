American car culture, fed by everything from our sprawled out landscape to a daily bombardment of car ads, is kept alive by journalists’ use of a set of hackneyed narratives. Beyond clichés, these story lines represent a collection of myths that shore up an unhealthy, unequal, and ultimately unsustainable car system. Americans Love Their Cars -- and thats why we pollute our air, destroy our cities, and make ourselves fat? Image: Smashing Magazine Americans love their cars. A Google search for this statement returns 2.8 times as many hits as “Americans love their pets” and 6.3 times as many as “Americans love their guns”. Yes, there will always be automotive enthusiasts and drivers fond of their cars. But our car culture is both shifting and conflicted: The last time they were surveyed by Pew , Americans saying they saw their cars as “something special”, more than just a means of transportation, had dropped from 43 to 23 percent. Americans may need their cars in our transit-starved and poorly planned landscape, but with mind-numbing traffic and volatile gas prices, the luster is off the chrome. Teens can’t wait to grab the car keys. The press persists in romanticizing a teen’s first trip to the DMV as the ultimate coming of age ritual. But it’s their middle-aged parents who are more likely to be champing at the bit, fed up with schlepping their kids and steeped in nostalgia about the freedom they felt when they first drove. But this generation is different. Already connected by smartphones and computers, and graduating into a terrible job market, young people are less car-happy than their parents were at the same age. Today’s teens are delaying getting their licenses and purchasing vehicles , and college students are more interested in living in urban centers where they can be less car-dependent. The economy depends on the auto industry. The popular, business, and political media alike echo the fallacy that a healthy US economy depends on a healthy auto industry. This chorus helped justify the 2009 bailouts of GM and Chrysler. But the auto industry knows that the dependency is reversed:  it needs economic growth, tax breaks and subsidies, and vibrant credit markets to sell cars. A nation more reliant on transit and active transportation would be one in which households had lower debt and more discretionary income to spend on housing, leisure, and other products, enriching a wide swath of industries. It would also be a nation, in the next downturn, less hostage to how a single industry’s fate might affect entire communities and supply chains. The America car industry can return to its former glory. This theme, sounded in Eminem’s paean to the resurrection of Detroit in recent Chrysler ads , is a media favorite. It resounds in stories about car companies that succeed because they “build the cars that consumers want” . The reality is that profitability in an industry so mature, when most families already own multiple vehicles, requires money be made mostly on auto loans and extended warranties. Toyota, which rose to #1 in an era when the press blamed Detroit’s troubles on its having the wrong products, has been making more on car loans than on selling cars . The auto industry’s next heyday, if there is one, will be as a finance business, not a manufacturing or transportation business as it was at its, and the American economy’s, mid-20 th century glory days. We can’t fix the car system because poor people will suffer .  Raise the gas tax? Institute congestion pricing? Eliminate oil subsidies? Limit risky offshore drilling? The news media regularly regurgitates the idea that these policies would make driving more costly and that this would necessarily hurt the working poor most of all. Of course, no group suffers under our current car system more than the poor , who devote a heftier chunk of their budgets to transportation than the rest of us and who are disproportionately victims of auto sales fraud, predatory lending, discriminatory insurance pricing, and racial profiling in traffic violations. Simple solutions like redirecting oil and auto subsidies to transit improvements and exempting the poor from new gas taxes would increase equality of mobility. These myths about our car-dependent transportation system, and the industries that benefit from it, too often go unquestioned by journalists and opinion leaders. Advocates for transportation equity and for a modern transportation system must challenge these assumptions. Rather than let ourselves be paralyzed by these truisms or lulled into thinking these myths harmless, we must tackle these obstacles standing between us and a better transportation future.

Before the automobile, there was plenty of space for bicycles and pedestrians. What we should be saying is that we gave too much space to automobiles and we should convert it back to bicycle use.   kuroneko In response to " Hawaii: Say Aloha To Transit-Oriented Development " "/> Archived Articles Select Month August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 Recent Comments 7 comments so far today View all comments  Hot Topics Categories Select Category Accidents(1) 2009 Transportation Bill(139) Aaron Naparstek(3) AARP(4) AASHTO(28) Ad Nauseam(12) Adolfo Carrion(6) Agenda 21(4) Air Quality(87) Al Gore(3) Alabama(3) American Society of Civil Engineers(2) Amsterdam(3) Amtrak(81) Andy Wiley-Schwartz(3) Angela Glover Blackwell(2) Anthony Foxx(9) Anthony Weiner(7) APTA(11) Arizona(1) Arkansas(2) Athletes and Celebrities(6) Atlanta(32) ATU(6) Austin(3) Australia(6) Auto Makers(1) Baltimore(4) Barack Obama(137) Barbara Boxer(71) Berkeley(1) Berlin(1) Bicycle Infrastructure(70) Bicycle Safety(25) Bicycling(234) Bike Lanes(31) Bike Sharing(21) Bike/Ped(310) Bikes Belong(2) Bill Shuster(5) Bogotá(7) Bonds(1) Boondoggles(3) Boston(14) Boulder(3) Bridges(23) British Columbia(1) Brookings Institution(5) Brownfields(1) Bruce Schaller(11) Buffalo(2) Bus Rapid Transit(19) Buses(48) California(29) Campaign Contributions(6) Car Dependence(16) Car-Free Parks(2) Car-Free Streets(3) car-sharing(3) Carbon Tax(11) Carly Clark(1) Carnage(3) Carolyn Konheim(3) Cars(273) Cartoon Tuesday(18) Cash for Clunkers(26) Cato Institute(1) Chamber of Commerce(3) Charles Komanoff(11) Charles Schumer(9) Charleston(3) Charlotte(3) Chicago(29) China(6) Chris Leinberger(1) Chuck Schumer(7) Ciclovía(2) Cincinnati(2) City Council(4) Civil Rights(13) Clarence Eckerson(7) Cleveland(22) Climate Change(265) Colorado(6) Community Boards(9) Community Organizations(2) Commuting(46) Complete Streets(32) Congestion(13) Congestion Pricing(96) Congress for the New Urbanism(12) Connecticut(7) Contests(1) Copenhagen(14) Curitiba(1) Dallas(5) Dan Doctoroff(5) Dan Garodnick(1) David Burwell(2) David Byrne(3) David Levinson(1) David Paterson(1) David Weprin(4) David Yassky(5) Delaware(1) Denmark(2) Denver(9) Detroit(29) Development(86) Distracted Driving(16) Donald Shoup(8) DOT(66) Drunk Driving(1) Earl Blumenauer(34) Earmarks(8) Economics(212) Elderly  Disabled(12) Elections(34) Electric Cars(3) Elliot Lee Sander(5) Elliot Spitzer(6) Energy(189) Enrique Peñalosa(2) Environmental Review(11) EPA(39) Equity(20) Events(1) Eyes on the Street(1) Eyes on the Street(15) Families(1) Fare Hikes(6) Federal Funding(199) Federal Highway Administration(31) Federal Stimulus(148) Federal Transit Administration(52) FHA(1) Florida(24) Fort Greene(2) Frank Lautenberg(3) Freight(19) Fresno(1) Fuel Efficiency(21) Gabe Klein(5) Gabrielle Giffords(2) Gary Toth(5) Gas Prices(80) Gas Tax(115) Gavin Newsom(2) George W.
