Advising All AFA students must plan their program with the art advisor Lynne Hull. The following procedure outlines the process for this achieving this award. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Complete the program planning worksheet. It is available from the link below. Next Next After you have filled out the program planning sheet (by relying on actual transcripts of your courses here and elsewhere), make an appointment with your art, drama or music advisor. (All full-time art, drama and music instructors are advisors). Talk with a faculty advisor early in your study so that you know which courses you must take in order to receive a degree or certificate. Previous Previous Next Next If you have transferred to NSCC from another school and you wish to have credits from other colleges apply to your AFA or CFA, you must obtain the “Incoming Transcript Request” form at the Admissions Office front counter and send it to the appropriate colleges. Send a separate request to each college involved. In approximately two weeks, check with Credentials to see if your transcripts have arrived. As soon as your transcripts have arrived, complete the “Application for Evaluation of Transfer Credits” from the front counter of the Admissions Office. Be sure to indicate the program for which you are requesting transfer credit. Once the credentials evaluators have received your transcripts and your application for evaluation of transfer credits, they will evaluate your credits on a first-come, first-served basis. The evaluators will send the “Transfer Credit Evaluation” form, which lists specific courses that apply to your program, to the Arts, Humanities and ABE Division dean and to the vice-president of instruction, who will decide whether or not to accept the credits presented toward your degree or certificate. Previous Previous Next Next When you have completed 30 credits toward the Certificate of Fine Arts or 45 credits toward the Associate of Fine Arts degree, make an appointment to see the head of your department so that your progress may be evaluated and a continuing plan toward your graduation can be created. Bring all of your transcripts and a copy of your “Transfer Credit Evaluation” form to that meeting, as well as your filled-out program planning sheet. Previous Previous Next Next After meeting with the head of your department, if it has been decided that you need to complete an “Application for Course Waiver” form so that certain courses can be waived or substituted, obtain this form at the front counter of the Admissions Office. If you need to petition for an exemption for one of the requirements to graduate, such as your last quarter in residence or fewer than 15 credits at North, obtain the “Petition for Waiver of NSCC Degree Requirements” form. Complete the student section and give it to the Arts, Humanities  ABE dean for approval. The form will be forwarded to the vice president of instruction for final acceptance. Previous Previous Next Next When you are registered in your last quarter’s classes toward the degree or certificate, you should obtain an “Application for Graduation” from the front counter of the Admissions Office and submit the completed form and a copy of your completed worksheet to one of the credentials evaluators. See the graduation pages as well. Congratulations on completing your fine arts award!
