What images do the 50s, 60s and 70s conjure up for you? Poodle Skirts, Elvis Presley, Drive-In movies, diners, sock hops, The Beatles, Peace Signs, Jimi Hendrix, Black Lights, The Monkeys, Smokey and the Bandit, Grease, Saturday Night Fever, Game Shows, Disco Balls, Magic 8 Balls and much more! Superfly cars Some of the more unusual vehicles will include two âSuperfly carsâ? courtesy of Les Dunham, coach builder and father of the pimpmobile and Superfly cars. The Cadillac El Dorado Superfly car was used in âFort Apache, The Bronxâ? and the Corvorado (Corvette made to look like an El Dorado) was featured in both âLive and Let Dieâ? and âSuperman The Movie.â? Ricky Nelsonâs 1932 Ford Roadster hot rod used in several episodes of âThe Nelsonâsâ? TV show will also be on display from May until July as part of this exhibit. Who could forget âSmokey and the Banditâ?? During the filming of the movie, Burt Reynolds was given a 1978 Pontiac Firebird Trans-AM (Bandit Car), the first Y-84 model which will be on display. Fiberglass 1962 El Tiburon "Shark" Geoffrey Hacker has generously loaned us his 1962 El Tiburon âSharkâ? to display in our exhibit until mid-September. The Shark Roadster was one of Hackerâs first fiberglass cars. He has owned the car for over 30 years since he found it sitting in a backyard in Clearwater, Florida when he was just 18. He was so captivated by the car that he drove by it every day just to see it one more time. When Geoff first asked the owner about selling the car he was denied, but two years later he managed to buy it for only $350 dollarsâhis entire savings. With help from his uncle and everything he had learned from his grandfather, Geoffrey restored the car in the early 1980s. He swapped out the original Renault 4CV engine and transmission for a set from a 1971 Renault R10. He has also given it the original Shark inspired paint job that debuted on the 1961 Shark coupe. The Sharkâs first major appearance in 50 years was this past March at the 2013 Amelia Island Concours dâElegance. It has been featured in many articles by the Forgotten Fiberglass blog (by Geoff Hacker, Ph.D., and Rick DâLouhy), AutoWeek.com, MyCarQuest.com, Jay Lenoâs Garage, and Hemmings Daily. It is rare to see such a futuristic car that was made so many years ago. âIt looked like something from the future came back and crash landed- about 20 years ago,â? were some of the words from Geoffâs mouth the day he first laid eyes on this one of a kind, dazzling vehicle. And after all of his hard work restoring it to its spectacular design, you canât help but not show it off! We are proud to be able to add it to our collection to go along with other fun cars from the 50s, 60s, and 70s that everyone can enjoy. This collection of cars is made up of tricked out chrome covered cars of the 70s, muscle cars of the 60s, and elegant and extravagant cars from the 50s. The Shark does anything but fit in, although it will enhance our Pop Culture& Cars Exhibit by bringing the futuristic touch full circle. Jap Leno's Garage: Shark Feature  Other Cars and Memorabilia Memorabilia includes lots of movie posters, lava lamps, LP covers, Jukebox, disco ball, light up dance floor, an original movie costume from âBuck Rogers of the 25th Centuryâ? and more. We would like to thank Mr. B Entertainment, USA Theatres, Old Sled Works and The Atomic Warehouse for loaning us some great memorabilia for this exhibit along with those who loaned items from their private collections.
