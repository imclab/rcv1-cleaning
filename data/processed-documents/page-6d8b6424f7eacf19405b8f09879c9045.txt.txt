 Understanding Literature More than two thousand years ago, the Roman poet Horaceclaimed that literature is sweet anduseful. Since then, literature has been traditionallyunderstood, at least in Western cultures, as having the dualpurpose of entertaining and educating its audience. Literarytexts are constructed in effect as objects of beauty, sources ofpleasure and as conveyors of messages and information. Whileauthors often claim no practical purpose for their works, allliterature constitutes an attempt at persuasively conveyingcertain values and ideas. The entertaining and beautiful aspectof literary works acts in reality as part of the appeal andattractiveness which the work tries to attach to the ideas whichit seeks to convey. The beauty of literature is therefore a partof its rhetoric, a device intended to strengthen the overallpersuasiveness and influence of the work on its audience. Whilethe entertaining aspect of literature may be rather obvious,understanding the ideas or values which a text advances is notalways a simple task. Part of the problem is the fact that theideas of a literary text are almost always presented in indirector symbolic form. Take for example the following verysimple narrative: In itself an amusing story, we know nevertheless that one ofthe purposes of this fable of Aesop--a Greek storyteller of the6th century B. C.--is to teach a point about the dangers of greedand the importance of being happy with what we have. Althoughthose points are not literally or explicitly made in the story,they are embedded in its symbolism. In this story, the animal andhis actions are not to be taken literally but instead are to beunderstood as symbolic representations of certain kinds of humancharacter and behavior. An important guide in literary study isthe idea that one must always strive to go beyond the literal orthe mere appearances of things and search instead for themeat of the story. Unlike the dog of Aesop's fable,we should not allow ourselves to be fooled by false appearances.In the reading you will do in this course, you will be engagingin a constant search for the ideas and values which, althoughoften not explicitly mentioned in the texts, constitute thesubstance of literary works. The fact that literary texts very much seek to convey amessage to their audience does not mean that their authors arealways fully aware of or even interested in that function oftheir work. Authors in effect often craft their works in verypractical and almost automatic ways and do not bother asking oranswering questions as to their significance. What seems mostimportant to authors is to create a pleasing or beautiful objectwhich somehow closely conforms to and expresses the features ofan otherwise undefined inward impulse. Many authors in fact arequite hostile toward the interpretation of their works and refuseto have anything to do with it. Samuel Beckett is quoted ashaving said, it's bad enough to have to write these bookswithout talking about them too. To begin to understand thisodd relation of literature to its authors, we may recall itsanalogy, noted by Sigmund Freud, to the relation between dreamsand dreamers. Just as dreams often convey meaning and informationto the dreamer in puzzling symbolic images, literature may besaid to function in a similar way. The author of a literary textcan be compared to a dreamer transcribing his dreams into writtenlanguage. But just as a dreamer is often unaware of the meaningof his/her own dreams, writers too cannot always explain what itis that their writings mean. The writing of literature is manytimes an almost unconscious performance which allows for thehalfveiled expression of ideas and concepts which transcend theconscious mental life or avowed intentions of authors. Dealingfrequently with highly charged, emotionally loaded, dangerous, orthreatening ideas and desires, dreams and literary textsconstitute ways of giving 'safe' (i.e. unclear, ambiguous, andconcealed) and also powerful and influential expression tomaterials which, for a variety of reasons, cannot or should notbe fully brought into consciousness or verbal expression.Therefore, the opinions and ideas of an author about his/her ownwork are not necessarily the most reliable guides toward ameaningful interpretation of a text. Like a psychoanalyst and hispatient, an intelligent and attentive reader may be able tounderstand a text better than the very person who wrote it. Given that literature attempts to promote certain ideas,values, or ideologies, one might inquire as to their precisenature and content. All literary works are produced by specifichuman beings belonging to specific cultures at given historicaltimes and occupying very definite positions within the structuresand hierarchies of their societies. Not surprisingly, the ideasand values which literary works seek to promote are influenced bythe history, culture and circumstances relevant to theindividuals who produce them. Rather than a disinterested oridealistic endeavor, literature is a very worldly and verypractical sort of activity aimed at the promotion anddissemination of cultural values and views of the world which aretightly connected to the interests of the author and of thedominant and other powers in her/his society. It should be notedof course that the relation of the author to the powers,institutions, and systems of belief of his/her time can be one ofaffinity, opposition, or even ambiguity. For these reasons, anunderstanding of literature and of particular literary textsdepends not only on the isolated reading of certain individualworks and the consideration of their authors's lives and theircircumstances but also upon a solid knowledge and criticalexamination of the human history, language, and culture(including art, music, philosophy, religion, science, politics,etc.) of which literature forms part and which it represents. Thestudy of literature is therefore an eminently interdisciplinaryendeavor through which we attempt to make sense of the humanexperience throughout history and of the ways in which humanbeings represent that experience and come to an understanding ofthemselves and of the world around them. An important feature of literary texts which distinguishesthem from other kinds of persuasive discourse is the fact thatthey operate not through direct statement and explicit revelationof their contents but instead through indirect allusion,understatement, implication, and even concealment. Literary textsin effect often veil the 'truth' which they seek to convey in anattempt at enhancing its attractiveness and endowing it with asense of mystery and transcendental value. Literature, much likemodern advertisement, is often an attempt at persuasion whichoperates on subliminal levels and artfully instills its messageby concealing it under a cover of fictional situations anddevices affecting the audience on emotional, intuitive,experiential, and instinctive levels. A given story for examplemay seek to promote a particular view of the world not by flatlystating it but instead by constructing a set of emotionallycharged and seemingly realistic situations leading tothe almost unavoidable, but always unstated, conclusion of thestory's intended moral. Literary texts thus convey meaning totheir readers in ways which go far beyond the mere literal orsurface level of signification. Indeed, literarytexts distinguish themselves from other texts by the subtletiesand intricacies of their many levels of meaning and by the commonfact that the actual meaning of the text is almostalways hidden and implicit in the fabric of the work's devices.Meaning in literature is therefore something that needs to bedetermined not merely on the basis of a face value understandingof the words in it but through a complete evaluation of thesignifying complexity of the rhetoric, figures of speech, images,symbols, allusions, connotations, suggestions, and implicationsof the entire text. Given its tendency to speak about its subject indirectly, theessential mode of communication of literature may be said to be asymbolic one. A symbol may be defined in general terms as asignifier of a complex nature which always places its mostimportant referent outside of itself. For the purposes ofconveying meaning, literary texts make use of a variety ofspecial signifying devices--known in general as figures ortropes--such as symbols, allegories, metaphors, metonymies,similes, paradoxes, ironies, etc. Although each literary devicehas a name and a definition, it is not so important to know whatthey are called so much as to understand that, in general,symbolic figures make indirect references and createsemi-invisible chains of association between different sets ofimages, concepts, and ideas. The associative logic that governsthe behavior of those chains of meaning, however, is not alwaysfixed or consistent and often varies widely from text to text andeven within a single text. A sensitive and alert reading of aparticular text is therefore of paramount importance indiscovering the internally-defined logic of association relevantto that text and its parts. While the logic of association of literary texts is unstableand variable, it is almost always grounded on binary systems ofdistinctions and polar oppositions defined either by literaryconvention and/or internally within the text. Given a set ofbasic symbolic oppositions, connections created by symbolicfigures in a text are generally governed by similarities to anddifferences from the basic binary parameters. Being able toperceive similarities and differences between groups of images,words, and ideas in a text is therefore the first step toward thediscovery of its underlying categories and structures of symbolsand ideas. Take for example a story where a cruel monster isdescribed as having the appearance of a mountain lion and wherelater we find a seemingly virtuous man also compared to amountain lion. We can begin to perceive that, although they mayseem very different, the text also wants us in a way to place theman and the monster in the same category and perhaps understandthat the man is also, in some mysterious sense, a cruel monster.Such a story could in a very subtle way be implying a criticalcomment concerning the character of its hero or even the virtuescherished in the society in which the hero lives. Often indeedunder the faĂÂ§ade of an unbelievable tale of monsters andadventures lies hidden the architecture of an entire set ofvalues and a complex system of thought and ideas. Outline of important points and issues: Literature as entertainment and education; to delight and influence the audience Horace (65-8 B.C.): literature dulce et utile (sweet and useful) Literature as rhetorical practice, relation to arts of persuasion Binding together of ideas with words and imagery appealing to the senses, as well as situations evoking an emotional response from the audience (pity, fear, sympathy, happiness, sadness, love, hate, etc.) Figurality of literary signification: symbol, metaphor, allegory; meaning beyond the literal Levels/layers of meaning: literal and figural or symbolic level of meaning The symbolic level has been sometimes subdivided into other levels--such as the moral, the allegorical, the anagogic--by authors and thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) and Dante (1265-1321). Tradition of representing ideas, concepts, values, and spiritual notions by means of sensory images. Thomas Aquinas believed the use of metaphors also relevant and appropriate to the biblical text: . . . it is befitting Holy Scripture to put forward divine and spiritual truths by means of comparisons with material things. . . . Now it is natural to man to attain to intellectual truths through sensible things, because all our knowledge originates from sense. Hence in Holy Scripture spiritual truths are fittingly taught under the likeness of material things (Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica ) Hermeneutics, exegesis: arts of textual interpretation; the search for meaning beyond the obvious and the literal Authors: intentions of the author; conscious and unconscious processes; Freud, dreams, dreamers and creative writers; determinants of the authorial conscious and unconscious: desire, history, culture, economics, politics, etc.; fragmentation/heterogeneity of the human subject and corresponding phenomena in the literary text; basis for variety of interpretations
