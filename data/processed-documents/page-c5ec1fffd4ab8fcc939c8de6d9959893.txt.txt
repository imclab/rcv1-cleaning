He probably needs it to portray Georges in eight to nine shows a week in the production of La Cage aux Folles that arrives Tuesday at the Kravis Center. As Georges, the conservative owner of a down-at-heel drag club in St. Tropez and the partner of Albin, the club’s diva, Hamilton is on stage almost constantly. That would be enough for any 72-year-old actor, but Hamilton is soldiering on with a torn Achilles tendon that he injured during rehearsal last fall. “Within 10 minutes, the whole choreography changed to me being an old geezer getting by,” he said. Geezer isn’t the way Hamilton has been characterized for most of his life. He’s better known as the bronzed, debonair escort of the likes of Lynda Bird Johnson, Elizabeth Taylor and Danielle Steele and the star of movies such as Zorro, the Gay Blade and Love at First Bite. When producers Fran and Barry Weissler asked him to play Georges in the gritty Terry Johnson-helmed revival of La Cage, he agreed because he considered it a challenge. The Harvey Fierstein-Jerry Herman crafted musical has earned best musical or best revival Tonys in each of its three incarnations. “You must always pick something that’s bigger than yourself, that you’re not sure you can do,” Hamilton said. “Don’t play it safe.” Hamilton is a perfect fit for the role, said Barry Weissler, who was among the producers of the Chicago revival, in which Hamilton played Billy Flynn for three stints on Broadway. “We all know George, what a bon vivant and impresario he is,” the producer said. “He is what the character is all about.” Even so, when Hamilton was thrown in with a cast of stage veterans headed by co-star Christopher Sieber he felt “like I was stepping in for Roger Federer at Wimbledon,” he said. His sense of humor sees him through, as it has throughout his life. He picked up the trait from his mother, the late Palm Beach resident Anne Hamilton. It’s often thought that people with senses of humor lack depth, but “that’s not the truth,” the actor said. “You see the inanity of the smaller situations in life and don’t make much of them, especially when it comes to your own importance in them.” Still, he has worked hard at polishing his performance. Early reviews were rightfully checkered, he said. More recently, The Washington Post’s January review observed that Hamilton portrayed Georges “with charm and dignity.” He’s getting better at playing the straight man opposite Sieber’s flamboyant Albin, which Hamilton says brings audiences to their feet at every performance. “A certain humility comes with that,” he said. “But the straight man set-up is just as important as the comic delivery. If you don’t set it up right, they don’t get their laugh.” Hamilton spent his late teens in Palm Beach and began his acting career at Palm Beach High School, where he earned a state prize for his starring role in Brigadoon before heading to Hollywood to try his luck in the movies. He’s still a fan of Palm Beach, where his younger brother David lives. “I love it there,” he said. “I’m more attached to there than I am to anywhere else.” He owns a condo nearby in West Palm Beach, where he hopes to spend some time with his fiancee, a German doctor, before wrapping up the tour with a Canadian leg in September. Hamilton’s Palm Beach friends are excited about La Cage’s Kravis stop, his brother David said. “They want to go out after the show,” he said. Late-night carousing probably isn’t on the books. “He says he’s dead tired after singing and dancing all night,” his brother said.
