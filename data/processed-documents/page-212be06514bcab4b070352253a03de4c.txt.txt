Well - Bill took the car in for diagnostics and came out to tell us that all that was needed was new sparkplugs and a bunch of loose bolts to be tightened. Less than $40.00 later the car ran like the proverbial top. Needless to say every car I have owned for the past 25 years has been maintained by the Car Care Center.

Did you know There's a very good reason to change the oil filter along with the oil...if you don't, you're leaving about a quart of dirty oil behind along with that grimy old filter that isn't actually filtering any more. Like trying to use a coffee filter over again, it doesn't do the job. Yes, one could call it an âoil serviceâ and change only the oil, and then ask the customer to spend more for the oil filter you already know they needâitâs done widely. But in all honesty, we just felt some light should be shed on those tricky ads that exclude things you'd expect to be included, like the omitting of filters to bring the ad price down (but then the up-sell you know you're gonna get), all part of the oil change service that isn't what it pretends to be. So we are taking a quiet stand against the gimmicks that are so prevalent in auto service advertisements. There are better ways to compete for your business. And to make the point, we've dropped the prices on our famously thorough oil and filter change service. You will still get the same high quality synthetic blend oil (or the oil of your choice) and the same premium filter, but at a much lower price--and your car will still get a thorough check-up by our experienced ASE Certified technicians. You can schedule online through this website or email us at lynne@carcarecenter.com, bill@carcarecenter.com, or just phone us weekdays at 915-485-2061. No gimmicks.
