These works of historyand mythology tell of the origins of the Japanese people and theformation of the state. While the Nihon Shoki is written almostentirely in Chinese, the Kojiki is written in Japanese using Chinesecharacters and is more familiar. The great anthology known asthe Man'yoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves, c.770) contains around 4,500poems written by people from all walks of life, from emperorsto peasants. There are two main forms of poem in the anthology,long and short, of which the short form, or tanka , survives to this day. Tanka consist of five lines with 5-7-5-7-7syllables. The foremost mood in literature of this period waspersonal sincerity. The fairy tale Taketori Monogatari (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter), written in the 9th century,is thought to be Japan's first novel. It is widely known todayas Kaguya-hime (The Moon Princess) and is popular in children's picture books.It tells the tale of an old bamboo cutter who one day discoversa tiny child in a bamboo stem. He and his wife adopt her and thechild grows into a beautiful woman in just a few months (justas bamboo grows phenomenally quickly). She attracts many suitors,including the emperor but sets impossible tasks for them to winher hand. Finally Kaguya-hime declares that she will return toher home - the moon. The emperor sends thousands of troops tostop her but she eludes them and leaves only a letter behind.The emperor orders the letter burned on the highest mountain inthe land. Miraculously, the the letter continues producing smokeand as a result the mountain became known as Fuji, the immortalone. Undoubtedly the earliest great work of fiction was Genji Monogatari (The Taleof Genji) written in 1010 by Murasaki Shikibu (left), a lady of the Heian court (modern day Kyoto). It is amassive 54-volume tome that tells of the romantic adventures ofnoblemen, centering around the prince Genji, who has gone downin Japanese folklore as their version of Casanova or Don Juan.It also provides a glimpse into the daily life of 10th and 11th-centurycourtiers, as does Makura-no-soshi (The Pillow Book) by Sei Shonagon ,another woman of the court. The literature of the Heian Period(794-1185) is characterized by mono-no-aware , or a feeling of being connected to nature and all things. Thisconcept is still considered central to the Japanese psyche thoughit's not so easy to see in the Japanese of today. Five centuries of great upheaval and almost constant war followedthe Battle of Dannoura in 1185, in which the ruling Taira clan was defeated by the Minamotoclan (also known as the Genji). The battle became the subjectof the most famous prose piece of the time, the Heike Monogatari (The Tales of the Taira Clan, c.1220) whose author is unknown.The mood of gloom and solitude that enveloped the country is reflectedin the literature of the time. It is often described using theterm yugen (mystery and depth). The most important people in Japanesesociety during this time, which spanned the Kamakura (1185-1333) and Muromachi (1333-1573) periods, were the samurai warriors, who lived a lifeof action, and the Buddhist priests, who spent their days in silentcontemplation. Many of the great writers were priests. The Shin Kokin-shu (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems, 1205) is one ofthe greatest anthologies of poetry from this period. It was compiledby the poet Fujiwara Teika but one of the major figures included is the priest Saigyo . A form of poetry developed at this time was renga, or linkedpoems. Three or more poets cooperated in composing one long poem.The greatest renga masters, Sogi , Shohaku , and Socho , together made upthe famous Minase Sangin (Three Poets at Minase) in the late 15th century. After peace was restored to the land under the Tokugawa shogunate, who ruled from Edo (modern day Tokyo), new forms ofculture evolved as Japan was closed to the outside world for overtwo centuries. The Edo period (1600-1868) saw the growth of the merchant class and withit the development of an earthier kind of popular culture. Stillpopular examples include kabuki , ukiyo-e (woodblock prints of actors and prostitutes) and novels like Koshoku Ichidai Otoko (Life of an Amourous Man) and Koushoku Gonin Onna (Five WomenWho Loved Love) by Ihara Saisaku . These novels are bawdy tales equally about the love lives andthe financial wheelings and dealings of the mercantile society.But at the same time, the Edo period also saw the developmentof the poetic form considered the finest achievement of Japaneseliterature - the haiku . Perhaps most concisely described as the distilled essence of poetry,haiku are 17-syllable poems whose development was strongly influencedby the Zen Buddhism that was prevalent at the time. Though thecurrent 5-7-5 syllable structure and mandatory use of a kigo ( a word to represent the season) were only introduced laterin the Meiji period (1868-1912), the greatest exponent of haiku lived in theEdo period. Basho Matsuo (1644-94) was a Zen lay priest and his haiku often form partof travel journals and were written on the road, capturing hismood and surroundings in various parts of the country as he tracedthe footsteps of earlier literary greats such as Saigyo and Sogi.The best known work is Oku no Hosomichi (Narrow Road Through the Deep North - it is available in theEnglish translation Narrow Road to Oku by famous Japan scholar Donald Keene ). It tells of Basho's almost 1,500 mile pilgramage with his discipleSora from Edo to northern Japan, undertaken when he was 48 andshortly before his death.The two other great haiku poets of thisperiod were Yosa Buson , a painter and Kobayashi Issa , a peasant villager. The shortest poetic form in the world, haiku work better in Japanesethan in English and translations are particularly difficult. Anyway,here are some translations of haiku by Basho from Oku no Hosomichi.The photo on the left shows the last haiku inscribed on a hugestone next to the Mogami River.
