How will it be remembered? With a design said to have been inspired by a question mark scribbled on the back of an envelope, BBC Television Centre is one of the UKs most recognisable cultural landmarks. As a BBC handbook from 1960 points out, TV Centre was the most up-to-date, self-contained broadcasting centre in Europe - the first in Britain to be designed specifically for television. Some of the best-known programmes on British television were recorded within its walls: Dads Army, I Claudius, Fawlty Towers, Top of the Pops, Monty Pythons Flying Circus, The Two Ronnies, Blue Peter, classic era Doctor Who and Absolutely Fabulous.

The three main television studios will be refitted and leased out to production companies, including the BBC, from 2014. The 14-acre site will also house the BBCs commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. This is a cathedral to the entertainment and news industry, said Esther Rantzen earlier this week. It is a media cathedral. Its not just bricks and mortar. The Â£200m development will see the forecourt opened up to the public Rantzen, who joined the BBC as a clerk in 1966 and worked as a researcher before achieving fame as the presenter of Thats Life!, added: I thought it was the most exciting set of gates ever to walk through. I knew this was a dream factory. Madness will play live on Friday in front of the Grade II-listed building in west London. Broadcast live on BBC Four, the gig is followed by a two-hour show Goodbye Television Centre . Hosted by former BBC chairman Michael Grade, the programme includes contributions from Sir David Attenborough, Sir Terry Wogan, Sir Michael Parkinson, Sir Bruce Forsyth, Sir David Jason, Penelope Keith and Ronnie Corbett. Continue reading the main story BBC TELEVISION CENTRE Opened: 29 June 1960 Location: four miles west of central London on Wood Lane, Shepherds Bush Architect Graham Dawbarn was inspired when he drew a triangle with a question mark in the middle Its distinctive circular main block is affectionately known as the doughnut The central sculpture, by T B Huxley-Jones, depicts Helios, the Greek god of the sun and represents the radiation of television light around the world The two reclining figures at the bottom are Sound and Vision The Forsyte Saga was the last major drama serial to be shot in black and white in 1967 The same year, Vanity Fair - starring Susan Hampshire - became the first drama series in colour The House of Eliott in 1994 was the last major drama series to be shot at TVC The building was damaged by a car bomb left outside in March 2001 The last network news bulletin went out from TV Centre on Sunday, 17 March 2013 But amid the strolls down memory lane, some voiced their regret over the closure. Sir Terry said: I know its only a building. I know its an inanimate object and it doesnt have a heart. But it has a spirit. There are spirits here, of immensely talented, brilliant people who made some of the best television programmes ever seen and I think its a shame. Its a shame to close it down. The allegations of sexual abuse by presenter and DJ Jimmy Savile have also cast a shadow over the buildings past. Its absolutely horrible. Ghastly. Its certainly a stain on the history of TV Centre. But it doesnt undermine the importance of TV Centre, Lord Grade told The Independent this week. The former BBC One controller and director of programmes described the building as the focal point for everything the BBC did best. Back of an envelope Designed by Graham Dawbarn, Television Centre was built in 1960 on the site of the Franco-British exhibition of 1908. Its distinctive circular main block - which housed the studios, dressing rooms and offices - was known to staff as the doughnut. The story goes that Dawbarn came up with idea in the pub after he drew the triangular shape of the building site on the back of an old envelope. Doodling a question mark in the middle, he realised it would make the perfect design. Susan Hampshire outside the dressing rooms in the doughnut during filming of The Forsyte Saga in 1967 Susan Hampshire was among the actors who came to know the studios well in the 1960s. In 1967 she starred in The Forsyte Saga, the last major drama to be shot in black and white; and Vanity Fair, the first to be made in colour. TV Centre had a family feeling. You walked along the corridor and everybody said hello, she recalled. But all the corridors did look the same. We all got lost on our way to find the studio or the canteen. Unless you recognised someone in the costume from your period you had no idea where you were. All of us would end up in the wrong studios. The people who never got lost were the BBC tour guides, who showed thousands of visitors around the building for more than a decade. We knew those corridors pretty well, said Kelly Barnes, operations manager for BBC Tours . TV Centre tours ended in February, but demand was so high in the final weeks that there were 18 separate tours running daily. Kelly Barnes (right) with visitors on a BBC tour in front of the famous facade of Studio TC1 Visitors would get a close look at Gene Hunts Audi Quattro from Life on Mars and the Tardis from Doctor Who. In the studio viewing galleries, they might glimpse rehearsals for shows like Strictly Come Dancing. Sometimes youd catch sight of the dancers having a cigarette out in the hub in their dressing gowns, said Ms Barnes. People loved seeing that it wasnt so glamorous behind the scenes. Most celebrities were really friendly, though occasionally youd see them turn round and walk the other way. Once Ricky Tomlinson, from The Royle Family, came over and said hello, but the tour guide had to tell him the tour group were French and had no idea who he was! One of the last programmes to leave TV Centre has been quiz show Pointless, presented by Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman. I know everything has to move on, but Im glad theres been an outpouring of affection for TV Centre and an understanding of its place in the pantheon, said Osman, who is also creative director for independent production company Endemol UK. Richard Osman (left) tweeted this picture of himself and Alexander Armstrong as quiz show Pointless came to an end in Studio TC6 Before its move to Elstree last month, Pointless was recorded at TC6, a studio that was also home to Tomorrows World, Doctor Who, Only Fools and Horses, Fawlty Towers and Blue Peter. I was very sorry to leave, said Osman. Its nice to have somewhere where everyone is working together on different shows and genres. Theres something about an industry where everybody knows each other. Our camera supervisor, Nigel, had worked in TC6 for 30 years - his first ever show was in that studio making Top of the Pops. It was a place hed put so much love into, along with so many other craftsmen and craftswomen who genuinely adore the place and adore their jobs. It all bleeds into the walls of the place. So many amazing comedy and entertainment shows have been made there. I think its a terrible shame - it feels like theyve closed down the Royal Opera House.
