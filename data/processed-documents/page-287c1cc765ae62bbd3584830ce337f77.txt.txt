Zaroot Concept Car: Futuristic Sporty Styling at its best coupled with excellent Nissan Auto Parts from Parts Train from : Jenny McLane The Zaroot is Nissan's way of showing how sporty SUV's could look in the future. Combining traditional SUV value, off-road ability and futuristic sporty styling definitely makes an aggressive visual statement. The concept car is indeed a promise of things to come for Nissan. It also could spawn a unibody, compact SUV for the U.S. market to compete with the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4. The Zaroot definitely makes an aggressive visual statement, with substantial wheel arches, the now-familiar Nissan truck front end styling, and huge gullwing doors that stretch from the A-pillar to the C-pillar. There is no B pillar. The pentagonal doors define the look of the Zaroot with its front and rear graphic treatment adding a futuristic twist. A bluff nose that ensures minimum front overhangs and double strut grille and arch graphic roof line makes the Zaroot stand out even more. Dramatic Gullwing doors provide the focal point of the Zaroot design lending a unique shape and making the car a head turner especially when both doors are open. The roof-mounted spotlights have been neatly integrated into the roof bars. The advantage of the gull wing aside from its impressive looks is the ease of access to the cabin they allow, both for passengers and luggage: with the rear seats folded, an awkwardly-shaped load such as a bicycle can be easily loaded into the vehicle with ease. Nissan designed the Gullwing doors by creating a shortened door that is only a little deeper than the side window so it can be easily opened especially in tight parking areas.. The trailing edge of the door finishes in line with the seat cushion, where it meets an extended sill. To maintain the ease of ingress and egress to and from the cabin, the sill automatically drops away underneath the vehicle whenever the door is opened. Nissan has ensured Zaroot is good to drive on-road, too, with strong performance, excellent road-holding and handling and high levels of comfort.
