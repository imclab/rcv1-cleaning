Robert Pattinson Was Caught Dating A Mysterious Woman Kim Kardashian Pinched Kanye Wests Butt in Public  Gossip Celebrity Music Movie Home Showbiz News Hollywood Entertainment Fashion Published On: Wed, Sep 9th, 2009 Celebrity | By judyhalone George Clooney speechless Against Gay Fan George Clooney — who is widely considered one of Hollywood’s sexiest actors — was left speechless by a gay fan who stripped off and asked him for sex. The 48-year-old actor was promoting new movie The Men Who Stare at Goats Tuesday when the infatuated admirer declared his feelings. The unidentified male stood up in the press conference and said, “I am gay, George, and I think I am in love with you… Please take me.” He then proceeded to strip to his underwear, leaving his tie in place, and added, “May I kiss you, please. Just one kiss?” Taking it all in his stride, George calmly replied, “It’s hard when you take a big chance and it doesn’t really work. “It’s always embarrassing when you take one real big swing for the fences and it just falls flat. It was a good try, though. You know, the tie looks good, and it’s just long enough.” In the film, George plays Lynn Cassady, a man who claims the CIA has a secret, psychic unit who are working to end war. Fielding questions about his private life during the conference, George — who is dating Italian TV presenter Elisabetta Canalis — also joked he was planning a same-sex wedding. Referring to The Men Who Stare at Goats director Grant Heslov , George said, “Grant and I are actually announcing our wedding while we are here. I don’t quite know how to answer that question, but I can read your mind again and I know what you’re thinking.” Tagged with: Actors , Admirer , Canalis , Cassady , Cia , Feelings , Fences , Fielding Questions , George Clooney , Grant Heslov , Hollywood , Infatuated , Italian Tv , Men Who Stare At Goats , Private Life , Sex Wedding , Sexiest , Tv Presenter , Underwear , Unidentified Male , Have Something to Say?
