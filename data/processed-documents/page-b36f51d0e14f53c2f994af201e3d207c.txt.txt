WE ARE DRIVEN - Official Trailer - Automotive Tuning Culture Documentary (OUT JUNE 9TH) You Tube You Tube  http://www.Facebook.com/halcyonphoto http://www.Facebook.com/wearedriven We Are Driven is a documentary film about the aftermarket car culture and lifestyle; releasing June 9th. It's the little things that happen at shows, meets, get together's that make the culture of the automotive aftermarket something truly unique. It's a culture that brings everyone together regardless of age, ethnicity, sex, economic status, or any difference that may exist. Whether you modify your car for looks, speed, to drift or drag, like it slammed to the floor with tight fitment, equipped with a rare kit or prefer an OEM+ look, JDM, Euro, VIP, Domestic, Exotic... - if you love what you do, we are all equal. This is all portrayed in the documentary film We Are Driven. Over the past 2 years, we have been out at countless shows, meets, get together's. Traveled the country from the Northeast to the South, all the way out West to Long Beach, California. Interviewed with some of the best known and most influential names in the game, whether it be a performance shop, culture blog, enthusiast, photographer/ videographer, event curator, we have reached out and touched all ends of the car lifestyle to truly understand what it is about the scene that makes it so unique, and make all enthusiasts so passionate about what they do.
