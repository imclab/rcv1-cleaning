Started by Louis Chevrolet, a race car driver and William C. Durant, founder of General Motors in the year 1911 Chevrolet started its first production with Classic six. Introduced in 1912, this touring sedan could accommodate five passengers and introduced several new features which included a folding top and an engine which can run 65 miles per hour. The second successful introduction was the 490 which satisfied the needs of the customers and Chevrolet was able to reach the 100,000 mark. With the new market share obtained by Chevrolet, Durant was able to regain his position in General Motors by 1918. During the year 1920, Chevrolet became a separate division of General Motors. In the 1950s the company added new features which enabled their customers to enjoy a more luxurious drive in the entry-level segment of cars.
