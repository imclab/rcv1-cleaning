As automobiles become increasingly complex, the need for service technicians will increase for the foreseeable future. Seven programs are offered: five Certificate programs, a Diploma program, and an Automotive Technology Degree program. Comprehensive technical education is offered through various instructional methods to qualified students from the Chester, Lancaster, and York county areas. To achieve our mission, we design and deliver effective competency-based instruction. Our approach to organizing competency-based education is systematic yet flexible. This approach focuses on defining, in measurable terms, what students are able to learn and then evaluating how well they can perform designated tasks after instruction. Department Mission The purpose of this department is to offer accessible, relevant, and high quality education by providing a comprehensive program of systematic, competency based instruction in the area of Automotive Technology.
