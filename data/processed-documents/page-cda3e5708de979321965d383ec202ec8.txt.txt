The Radio Arts Foundation-St. Louis, which provided considerable financial support to the old "Classic99," KFUO-FM, hopes to be on the air with a new FM station in early June, pending FCC approvals. The new station, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation, will broadcast over a combination of regular analog radio, an HD-2 channel and live streaming over the Internet. St. Louis currently has one classical option, KWMU (90.7 FM), which offers live broadcasts of St. Louis Symphony Orchestra concerts on its analog station and programming from Minnesota Public Radio on the station's HD-3 channel and at stlpublicradio.org. The proposed analog station will be audible "in the Highway 40-I-44 corridor," said station manager Jim Connett. Its position on the dial has not yet been confirmed. The HD channel will reach an area within a 50-mile radius of Shrewsbury. The plan is to increase the analog station's wattage, and thus widen coverage, as the money comes in to pay for it. The Radio Arts Foundation attempted to buy KFUO-FM from its then-owner, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, when the station became available in 2009 but was rejected by Kermit Brashear, a synod board member and its paid negotiator. The foundation immediately began working to secure a new station, said RAF board member Donna Wilkinson, even before the sale of KFUO to a Christian pop music station was complete in July 2010. Centene Corp. Chairman and CEO Michael Neidorff was involved in the early stages of the project, negotiating with Brashear and hiring Connett, the former KFUO program director, as a consultant, but Neidorff has since stepped back. The Centene Foundation gave $200,000 to begin the process and has committed $1 million more; further fundraising will begin in earnest this month. The total cost of the project is expected to be $5 million to $6 million over two years, including operating expenses. Connett said the fledgling station is shooting for at least $2 million before June. "It's a fast ramp-up from nothing to on-air," he said, "but as committed as this community is, when they consider what we have lost and what we will gain, it shouldn't be a problem." "Initially, the fundraising will be targeted" to deep-pocketed donors, Wilkinson said, noting that, in the future, a "Friends" organization is planned. The new station is likely to sound a lot like the old KFUO in terms of its on-air personalities. Connett will probably turn to his old colleagues for most of the announcing jobs. Musically, Connett promised that RAF-STL will be an improvement over the old "Top 100" model of endlessly cycling the same well-known works. "We had to raise quite a bit of money with advertising" on KFUO, to help pay for the religious programming on the synod's KFUO-AM. "We had to play the Arbitron game, to attract listeners and make it advertiser-friendly." As a nonprofit, however, RAF can broadcast only 72 minutes of advertising per day. Arts organizations and other nonprofits will get first crack at that time, said Connett, who said rates would be "affordable." There also will be opportunities for supporters to underwrite programming. That means, he said, that "we're going to have everything — chamber music, vocal music, choirs, opera, symphonic, jazz" and what he called "cultural programming." "This is a station for the community," added Wilkinson. The current four-member board — Chairman Dr. Robert R. Archibald, Noemi K. Neidorff, Babette Meiners and Wilkinson — will be expanded. There also will be live music: A newly built studio, at 7711 Carondelet Avenue, will have two broadcast studios, one on either side of a conference room that will double as a performance space. The station also will have a feed from the auditorium in Centene's Clayton headquarters building, a 250-seat space equipped with a Steinway grand piano. John Beck, senior vice president and market manager for Emmis Communications, approached Connett and Michael Neidorff, to suggest leasing an HD-2 channel, 96.3-HD2, at what he calls a "very affordable" rate. HD channels require a special receiver. Emmis also will help promote the new endeavor on its four local stations, reaching 850,000 people a week. RAF has been in discussions with arts groups, including Opera Theatre of St. Louis. At OTSL, the hope is to broadcast live performances. "I think that the resurgence of a classical radio station in St. Louis is just another demonstration of the commitment of St. Louisans to great cultural institutions," said Timothy O'Leary, general director at OTSL. "I think it's a very positive development for St. Louis."
