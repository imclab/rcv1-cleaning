Here are the 10 most costly repairs. By  Claire Martin  of MSN Autos Like real estate and relationships, cars require upkeep. If you neglect to change the oil , ignore the check-engine light or skip routine servicing, you're setting yourself up for a rude — and expensive — awakening. According to Art Jacobsen, vice president of CarMD.com , which publishes an online database of the most common and expensive check-engine-related automotive repairs, the key is to diagnose your car's problems early: "You've got to tackle it; address it when it's small, before it escalates." Here are the 10 most expensive vehicle repairs and what you can do to avoid them. Bing : Find a Local Mechanic 10. Replace Turbocharger/Supercharger Assemblies Turbochargers and superchargers help force air through the engine, allowing it to use more fuel, generate a bigger explosion in the cylinder and increase power. These devices typically operate at high rotational speeds, which make them vulnerable to damage and susceptible to heat. When they go bad, it can cost about $1,600 to replace them, with related repairs spiking the price by $700 to $3,000. If you're lucky enough to have a turbocharger or supercharger, you'll need to take care of it. "Make sure you have the right amount of oil in these units," Jacobsen says, noting that too much can be just as bad as, if not worse than, not enough. 9. Replace Torque Converter Assembly The torque converter assembly is a hydraulic coupling between the engine and the transmission. It's similar to a clutch in that it allows you to come to a stop in an automatic-transmission vehicle without stalling the engine. But when the torque converter overheats, it can spring leaks and its parts can warp, and a busted torque converter may prevent you from starting — or more disastrously, stopping — your car. One way to avoid overheating this part, and incurring roughly $1,800 in repairs, is to not rev the engine while you have your foot on the brake. Read:   9 Ways to Save on Car Maintenance 8. Replace Catalytic Converter Catalytic converters, which detoxify exhaust emissions, are important when you're getting a smog check and if you care about your car's impact on the environment. Most are built to last for 15 to 20 years, and before they go kaput, there are plenty of warning signs. Two culprits are busted oxygen sensors and misfires, which happen when fuel catches fire as it passes through the engine. When a catalytic converter fails, it's pricey: Repairs can cost up to $2,692. It's the parts that are expensive, not the labor. "They contain platinum, palladium and rhodium — three of the most precious metals known to man," Jacobsen says. 7. Replace Hybrid Battery A hybrid battery is often bundled with an integrated motor-assist battery, which charges it. Change one and you have to change both — to the tune of about $2,700. Because the technology is fairly new, it can be difficult to troubleshoot hybrid engines. "Hybrids are great, but when something goes wrong, you better have your checkbook ready," Jacobsen says. That's because there are a limited number of mechanics servicing hybrids and because parts are scarce. Hot weather in the South and Southwest taxes these batteries. To avoid repairs, you're best off driving them in mild climates. Read:   9 Things to Know Buying Electric 6. Replace Injection Pump A clogged injection pump, the device that delivers fuel into the engine's cylinders, is a relatively common problem for drivers, and the repair costs can vary widely. A Honda fuel pump might run a couple of hundred dollars and be straightforward to change. But in trucks and SUVs, the repair can cost upward of $2,900 because it's labor-intensive, requiring the mechanic to put the vehicle on a hoist and disassemble its rear. If you follow your vehicle's scheduled maintenance program and change the fuel filters regularly, your fuel pump should stay clog-free.

This article was written by an automotive expert? I've been an ASE master tech and general motors master tech for 20+ years, and this a prime example of how someone may have the privilege of writing an article, but has no knowledge whatsoever. This is an extreme disappointment in MSN's choice of "experts". Some of these repairs listed are not even appropriate for a lot of vehicles, and prices vary so much between manufacturers and models, it is irresponsible to throw out approx costs for these unlikely repairs. You must have basic knowledge of automobiles today to write an informative, helpful article. Replacing an injection pump?? What? What? Fuel injected vehicles have a "fuel pump". Diesels have an "injection pump". And incidentally, A lot of trucks and SUVs' cost LESS to replace than cars. 70% of vehicles can have their in tank fuel pump replaced for less than 1000.00 dollars at the DEALER!! The topper is replacing a cylinder??? A cylinder itself is not replaceable unless you are talking about a pratt and whitney air cooled radial AIRPLANE ENGINE!!! Or a VW bug engine!!! WTH?? Please MSN, please, stop adding more misinformation to the public!! It is already difficult enough trying to earn an honestliving in this field without poorly written, inaccurate and downright Idiotic information being given to the public thinking they are learning something by doing the right thing and reading your automotive TIPS!! BTW, if you need a consultant for these articles, i'm more than willing to contribute for free!!      130      3 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... Tim Childers Jan 25, 2012 9:44AM I happen to agree with most other posters here on this... this is so sadly and incompetently written, its almost the dumbest thing I have ever read! MSN: Please do yourself a favor and take heed of what we are saying... this is a joke. Who in the hell did you have to write this? You should always have someone who is familiar with the subject matter to do the writing, or at least the consulting. I have been a professional mechanic for all my adult life. I am ASE certified Master, I worked for 22 years straight in a dealership which started off with exclusively Volvo, and later grew into 5 diffrent lines. After my tenure there ended with their going bankrupt and shutting the doors late in 2008, I went to work in a top level Independent shop, where I am today. Your article is sorely lacking of subject knowledge. Incompetent would be about the best way to describe the writer. What bothers me the most, is what am I to make of other similar articles, with diffrent subject matters, that I may not be an expert in? Are they as bad off base as this one happens to be? You need halp when it comes to Automotive article writing and information, that's for sure. Unless you get some, do the uninformed world a favor, and please refrain from writing Automotive articles in the future! There is far and away enough DISinformation out there as it is.      86      3 Replies ( 1 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply...

Find a real automotive website that actually has writers who know what they are talking about to get your automotive information. There is no excuse for this kind of crap.

Yes I understand this is dumbed down so the average person can understand it, but it should at least be accurate; Cylinder replacement, really? Piston replacement or engine block rebuild maybe. Cylinder head assembly and spark plugs? The text dose not even mention the head or common reasons for head replacement, such as a crack from overheating due to low coolant. If you are not going to try, just cut out the articles and stick with manufacturer info.      67      4 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... Texas mechanic Jan 25, 2012 11:29AM How does a torque converter keep you from starting or stopping your car? I didn't even finish reading the rest of this. Go write an article about people that write articles about something they don't know anything about. That's an area in which you have a great deal of knowledge. This is the second article about auto repair in a row that is a disaster for MSN. Either give it up or pay me to make sure that it's acurate. I'm not cheap but at least you'll quit making a fool out of yourselves.      58      2 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... LS1 Bird Jan 25, 2012 7:22AM Replace a camshaft? Really??? How many people actually experience a camshaft failure?  And 2,600 bucks for a cat converter? Maybe on an exotic car, but for 90% of the cars on the road, you're looking at less than 500 bucks. And if you don't mind wrenching on your own car, you can get an aftermarket universal cat for about 200 bucks.      63      8 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... wascuda Jan 25, 2012 10:27AM I'm an ASE Master Tech for over 30yrs. and don't quite agree on these TOP TEN most expensive repairs---With todays technology and better built cars, they can go 200-300K miles with very little problems--Change the oil and filter at least every 6k,spark plugs,fuel and air filters, timing belt if you have one (most cars have chains which should last the life of the car)every 100k,and that's about all the average driver should have to do to keep his vehicle going great. Most of the top ten listed in this article can be fixed for a lot less than quoted by going about the fix by just replaceing the entire engine,trans or whatever with a good used part from a salvage yard or shopping Craig's List or E-bay. With only 2% of all cars sold being Hybrids, (I'm still not sold on the electric motor), most will never have to replace the expensive battery or inverter.      57      2 Replies ( 0 ) Hide replies Report Spam Previous replies     Write a reply... racer57 Jan 25, 2012 10:05AM Claire Martin needs to stick with Food and/or Travel.
