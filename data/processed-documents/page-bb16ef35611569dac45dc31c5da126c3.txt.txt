Seriously.  by An MSN Autos Consumer on 09/07/2009.  Trim: 2010 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 3.8 Grand Touring Manual, Owned less than 1 year.  5  Pros:  Sharp styling, turns heads, good performance, excellent premium audio, RWD. No need to buy premium gas. Cons:  A couple random rattles and creaks sometimes. Manual transmission notchy when cold. Overall review:  I've owned this car for 6 months now, and am very pleased with it. I didn't think I would ever be so excited about a Hyundai, but it's just a fantastic car. The car is stunning in person, pictures don't do it justice, you don't get the idea how wide and low it is.
