Yes, there are other four-passenger convertibles available,but they either cost far more or are "four passenger" only if the two inthe rear are six years old. Or both. These advantages have kept the SebringConvertible popular since its debut in 1996. While there is stylistic continuity with that originalSebring Convertible, the 2010 version is the third generation. Introducedfor 2008, it's gotten some mid-cycle revisions -- a new, simplified hoodand different wheels outside, and a new instrument panel inside. Three trimlevels of the front-wheel drive car are offered: the LX, with a 2.4-liter,173-horsepower four-cylinder engine matched to a four-speed automatictransmission, the Touring, with a 2.7-liter, 186-hp V6 and four-speedautomatic, and the Limited, with a 3.5-liter, 235-hp V6 and six-speedautomatic with Auto Stick manual shifting. An insulated multi-layer power cloth top is standard on all,with a color-matched folding metal top available on the Limited. Neitherone requires manual latching, so cloth or metal is merely a personalchoice. And a matter of an extra $1,995 to $2.240, depending on color. I'm about to end a summer week with a cloth-top Limited. Theweather has been a bit uncooperative -- I live near the Northern Californiacoast, but about 30 miles inland. We get the "marine layer", thick coastalfog, in the summer, but it usually doesn't make it this far inland.Usually and this year the weather seems to be anything but usual,everywhere. While the East gets baked and steamed, I get to freeze in thecloud. In the mornings, anyway. By afternoon it will be 80 or 90. Test theheat and air conditioning in one day! The Sebring Convertible handles it all with aplomb. Want tochange the top position? Hold the button on the dash, and it quickly goesup or down as desired. Visibility is more than decent with the top up,thanks to the large, heated glass backlight. Just use the mirrors.Top-down, no problem at all. The 3.5-liter engine has plenty of power forthe car's intended mission in life, which is touring, not sports. Ditto forthe comfort-oriented suspension. As always, Chrysler's Sebring Convertibleis a car for a pleasant cruise with friends or family on the highways orbyways. You may be interested in a Sebring Convertible even if youaren't looking to buy. The car has proven popular in vacation-destinationrental fleets, although likely at a lesser trim level than the Limited. Ifyour destination includes sun and scenery, it's a good choice. And,especially for that use, the useable, real, trunk space is a major plus. APPEARANCE: After nearly fifteen years, the SebringConvertible is a fixture on American roads, and it still gets looks andcompliments. The underlying structure and engines have changed over theyears, as have styling details. But the proportions are still very much thesame -- a short hood and rear deck emphasize a large cabin opening.Top-down, it's sleekly handsome, and there is no difference between clothand metal tops as both disappear completely below metal panels. And puttingthe top up detracts from its good looks not at all, especially with thecolor-matched hard top. Removal of the strakes on the hood simplifies thestyling, for a more cohesive look. Bright complex headlights and theChrysler signature eggcrate grille with winged logo top trip distinguish itat the front. Creased character lines in the rear fenders and deck adddefinition. COMFORT: What's the best thing about the Sebring Convertible?Ask the rear passengers! Even six-foot adults will fit, and in comfort.Access, via latches on the top of the front seats, is painless, even withthe top up. Once in place, the back angle is comfortable, headroom not anissue, and knee- and leg-room fine unless the front passenger isexceedingly tall. At the Limited level seating surfaces, most of the steering wheel rim, andshift knob are leather. Both front seats are heatable and have powercushion adjustment -- including height -- with manual back angle. Thesteering wheel is manually-adjustable for both tilt and reach, and ispleasantly thick, for a good grip, with auxiliary audio controls on theback sides of the spokes and Chrysler's trademark faux-tortoiseshell trimon the top part of the rim. That also adds interest to the door and dashtrim. How many guitar picks died for this interior? The IP top and frontare textured, soft-touch material, good for banishing windshield glare.Brightly backlit main instruments are easy to read in all light. There's ananalog clock at the top of the center stack. With the comprehensive "MediaCenter 730N" package comes an upgraded AM/FM/Sirius/CD/harddisc/USB/minijack audio system controlled via a simple hard-button andtouch-screen interface. USB and jack inputs are in the dash; there is spacefor a player and a power point in the compartment at the bottom of thestack (unless the "smoker's package" ashtray and lighter are specified).The climate control system works quickly and simply. Everyone gets acupholder, and small door pockets are augmented by a locking glovebox. Amoveable safety divider in the trunk allows a commodious 13.1 cubic feet ofstorage with the top up. Placed to allow top operation, there is still 6.6cft available, plenty for a couple of carry-on bags or more. SAFETY: The newest Sebring Convertible is rated by NHTSA atfour stars (out of five) for driver frontal crash protection, and five forthe front passenger. Both front and rear seats get five stars for sideimpact protection, and the car has a four-star rating for rolloverprotection. Multi-stage frontal, front seat side, and side -impact air bagsare standard, as are four-wheel antilock disc brakes. Traction control andelectronic stability control are available. RIDE AND HANDLING: Chrysler further improved the SebringConvertible's rigidity in the 2008 redesign, and that shows in thesoft-top's quiet interior, very minimal cowl shake, and smooth,comfortable ride. While the fully-independent MacPherson strut/multilinksuspension is tuned softly, for maximum comfort, damping is matched tospring rates so there are no unwanted aftereffects of road irregularities.It's not "sports", but it is sporty. PERFORMANCE: Here too, with the 3.5-liter V6, the SebringConvertible is not "sports" but definitely sporty and more than quickenough for daily duties. With 235 horsepower (at 6400 rpm) and 232 lb-ft oftorque at 4000 rpm, and good low- and mid-range torque, the single overheadcam, 24-valve engine works well in all day-to-day acceleration and mergingsituations. The six-speed automatic helps, with closer ratios than a four-or five-speed. EPA fuel economy is 16 mpg city, 27 highway. In a week ofmostly city and backroad driving, and as little highway as possible, Iaveraged 20 mpg. And even more smiles per gallon CONCLUSIONS: Improvements inside and out keep the ChryslerSebring Convertible at the top of its class.
