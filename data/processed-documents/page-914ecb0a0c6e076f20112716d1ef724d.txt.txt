Two years ago at the Beijing auto show, Mercedes-Benz stretched the form language, as well as the spelling, of the shooting brake body style with a design study it called the Concept Shooting Break . Now the German automaker is poised to rekindle the semantics wars with the Concept Style Coupe, a compact four-door vehicle scheduled to make its official debut in Beijing on April 23. The concept, described by Mercedes as the heartbeat of a new generation (not to be confused with the Concept A-Class, the  pulse of a new generation ”), further demonstrates the companys desire to bolster the bottom of its product portfolio. Shown within the past year were redesigns of the A-Class and B-Class , two volume-oriented compact models currently sold outside the United States. Mercedes will offer a preview of the concept this week in Los Angeles, at a multimedia art fair curated by Mike D of the Beastie Boys and organized by Jeffrey Deitch , the director of the citys Museum of Contemporary Art . The concept wears design cues put forward by the redesigned A- and B-Class, as well as by other recent Mercedes show cars. The diamond-like honeycomb pattern and crossbar on the grille were initially seen on the Concept A-Class, shown at the 2011 New York auto show . Opposing creases on the cars flanks have been employed for concepts like the F800 and F125 . According to Mercedes, the concept is equipped with a 208-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder gasoline engine and a dual-clutch transmission. Comand, the companys telematics system, provides access to applications stored in the cloud, not on the cars harddrive. The concepts name perpetuates a tendency that began with the Mercedes-Benz CLS, billed as a four-door coupe when it arrived in 2004. Other manufacturers, notably Volkswagen with its CC, née Passat Comfort Coupe, have since used the term to differentiate these four-door models, with elegantly sloping greenhouses and high belt lines, from traditional three-box sedans . Wheels will bring you news of notable debuts in Beijing next week, when press previews for the show begin.
