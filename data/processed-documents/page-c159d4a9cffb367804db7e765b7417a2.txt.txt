With a more wide-ranging audience than the average gallery, one of the things director Sharon Bates and her assistant, Kathy Greenwood , do best is choose themes with popular appeal  collecting, nostalgia, humor  and then slyly subvert those themes by choosing works that deconstruct them. So it is with "LOL." While many of the works here are funny, others are as much about humor as they are humorous. Effectively announcing this intention, Benjamin Entner's video, "BFF," is placed at the entrance of the show. A full episode of the sitcom "Friends" has been stripped of dialogue, leaving only a string of moments of both the audience and actors reacting, leaving the viewer out of the joke, laughing simply at laughter. If you find yourself laughing at the 12 silk-screened prints of Italian pizza box chefs in Michael Oatman 's piece " Cesare Lombroso 's House of Pizza ," the accompanying text printed on the inside of a pizza box is designed to make you question why you laughed. Oatman contends that this Italian chef, in all its many comical forms is the last ethnic stereotype we tolerate (although one could argue it's rivaled by the pervasive red-haired leprechaun that pops up every year around St. Patrick's Day). The subject of "The Upstate New York Olympics," a video by Tim Davis , is as much performance art as it is the familiar landscape of this particular place. The artist competes (against no one) in goofy, made-up athletic events such as "Abandoned Building Bowling" and "Compost Pile Freestyle." These events rely on physical humor and a willingness of the artist to make a fool of himself, sometimes at some personal risk. Not all works deconstruct an idea; some employ wordplay while others toy with size to get a laugh. With "Granny Panties for My Ex-Girlfriend," another piece by Entner, we see post-breakup revenge writ large in the form of 7-foot wide underwear. By contrast, Roger Bisbing works in miniature. For one piece, the artist has meticulously crafted tiny Shaker-style chairs and arranged them in rows of four with an aisle down the middle and two chairs at the front. If it's not immediately clear, especially given the venue, the title clues you in to the joke: "Shaker Air." Joy Taylor also plays with size with "Knife Rake, Fork Rake, Spoon Rake," in which she's replaced the tines of rakes with cutlery. Her subtle humor is also at work with "Double Heels" in which smaller high heels double for the original heels on a pair of pumps. Owen Sherwood 's "Projected Mid-Life Crisis" consists of six drawings combining muscle cars and Stewart's logos. Again, the title says it all. With "DMV," Andrew DeGraff spells out the cursive letters with a long line of bedraggled people. These works by DeGraff and Sherwood and other equally clever pieces were all seen last spring at the Art Center of the Capital Region show "The History of the World." Torrance Fish, Spring Hofeldt, Linda B. Horn , Brian Kane , Steven Rolf Kroeger , Minna Resnick and Gregor Wynnyczuk round out the list of artists providing the yuks. With this show, the curators succeed in their goal of giving weary travelers something to laugh at for a change as well as possibly making them think.
