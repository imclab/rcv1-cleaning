You can find car dealer licensepublications at: http://www.dealerlicense.com/dealers.html WARNING: Out-of-State licenses are NOT the best idea: I AM A CAR DEALER AND I AM ALSO A LAWYER, SO I HOPE YOU TAKE THE FOLLOWINGSERIOUSLY: There are many programs online where you can rent a dealerlicense or get licensed out-of-state. If you are wholesaling fromauction-to-auction, it's difficult for your state to bust you.However, these programs can be problematic, especially if you are advertising tothe retail public in your state, even if you are a wholesaler who sellsthrough a network of local dealers. Even if you have awholesale license in another state, by advertising to the retail public in yourstate, you are purporting to be a retailer and since you do NOT have a retaillicense in your state, the state considers it unlicensed auto sales,which is usually a misdemeanor crime. If you don't believe me, simply callyour local DMV investigator and they will certainly tell you the same thing. States are Cracking Down on Out-of-State Car Dealer Licenses! HERE'S SOME REAL PROOF: Recently someone called me about advice because they were busted in theirstate for unlicensed auto sales. What happened was they lived inFlorida and had a dealer license based in another state. Theyadvertised a car on Craigslist.com and an undercover DMV investigator pretendedto be a customer. Even though he had a dealer license in anotherstate, when the Investigator found out that the dealer did NOT have a Floridadealer license, the DMV slammed the guy with a civil injunction lawsuitagainst him and if he continues to sell cars in Florida with an out-of-statelicense, he will be prosecuted as well. That unlicensed dealer has had topay thousands in attorney fees for his defense. The investigator was niceenough to give him a slap on the wrist with a civil suit only, butnot all investigators are that nice - you can be prosecuted. Do youwant to take that chance? In many cases, it's CHEAPER to get your OWN car dealer's license thangetting an out-of-state license Why pay monthly fees to an out-of-state company when the same monthly feescan be applied towards your OWN in-state car dealer license. I talk todealers all day and many tell me that it ended up being CHEAPER getting licensedin their own state. If you know what the MINIMUM requirements are,it can be done. Your state will tell you the requirements, but theywill NOT tell you the easiest, fastest and cheapest way to get your CarDealer's license. You can learn the easy, fast and cheap way here. EVEN DEALER AUCTIONS ARE CRACKING DOWN ONOUT-OF-STATE LICENSES At my local Manheim dealer auction there is a huge sign that says: OUT OF STATE DEALERS:If you purchase a vehicle, it MUST be exported outside of this state. Not all auctions have this policy, but the trend is for more and moreauctions to follow this rule. The auction does this per the state'srequest because the state knows most out of state dealers who buy, will try tosell that car in the state the car was purchased in. This is aback-door method that the state is using to further crack down on unlicensedauto dealers. What this means is that the dealer auction will NOT release the car to youbecause you have an out of state license - you need to show the auction a billof lading from a trucking company that says the car is going to be transportedout of state. This can be MAJOR problem if you have an out of statelicense! Do it the right way - get a dealer license in your OWN statein your OWN name.

Information on Curbstoning Clever techniques people use to buy and sell cars without a statedealer's license. NOTE: This book iswritten as a nation-wide publication. Most states prohibit unlicensedauto sales for a profit. This book does not teach you how tocurbstone. It is an educational tool that sheds light on what goes on outthere. If you become a dealer, you need to know about curbstoners becausethey give dealers a bad name! T HE UNDERGROUND USED CAR BUSINESS The underground used car business is now a billion dollarindustry thathas been in existence since the advent of motor vehicles. Evidence of this can be seen on a daily basis - that tempting car parkedon an vacant lot or along a roadside curb with a  FOR SALE sign everyone seems to stop and curiously peer into. Nine times out of ten, the seller of the car is an unlicensed dealerlooking to make a fast buck. WHY DO STATESMAKE IT A CRIME? When someone buys and sells a car without a dealer license, the state getscheated out of sales tax, the IRS gets cheated out of income tax and since most unlicensedauto sales are untraceable, an innocent buyer who gets screwed over cannot sue because inorder to sue, they must know who to sue! STATES ARE NOTDUMB- THEY KNOW States are fully aware the underground car business exists. However,states also know there's not really much they can do about it. Just about the only thingthe state can do is limit the number of cars people can transfer per year. Other thanthat, because there are thousands of unlicensed transactions occurring daily, states haveno choice but to turn their cheek and walk away with their hands tied behind their backs. ADVANTAGES TOTHE UNLICENSED DEALER The greatest advantage unlicensed dealers enjoy is bypassing therequirement of having a dealer's license. DISADVANTAGES TOTHE UNLICENSED DEALER The greatest disadvantages are not being able to buy cars at exclusivedealer-only car auctions and being restricted by the state limit on how many cars that canbe sold in a year. BALANCEPROS AND CONS Many unlicensed dealers get licensed and earn a fantastic living. Others continue buying and selling cars without a license. There may be good reasons for this... 1. They cannot afford a dealer license 2. They want to build up more money before getting a dealer license 3. They simply are not ready to make the big move yet 4.
