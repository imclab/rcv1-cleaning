The model is the latest to join the C-segment crossover class and is based on the S-Cross concept, which was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show last year. At 4,300mm long and 1,765mm wide, the Suzuki is slightly shorter and narrower than the Qashqai. And Suzuki believes the SX4 Crossover will have an immediate advantage in its class because of the brand’s off-road expertise in compact cars. It will come with a choice of two engines – a 1.6-litre petrol and a 1.6-litre diesel - and both two and four-wheel drive versions will be available. The 4WD models will feature Suzuki’s new ALLGRIP technology which offers four selectable driving modes. Both manual and CVT automatic transmissions will be offered, too. The petrol gets a five-speed manual and the diesel a six-speeder, while the CVT has a seven-speed manual mode with steering wheel paddles. And emissions are among the lowest in the class, with the 2WD manual diesel setting the benchmark at 110g/km. The top-spec petrol versions emit 136 g/km. Inside, the new crossover gets what Suzuki claims to be the world’s first double sliding glass sunroof. The new SX4 Crossover will be built at the Magyar Suzuki factory in Hungary and go on sale later this year. Disqus - noscript Submitted by CarGeek on Tue, 2013-03-05 22:25. Wow, this has been very heavily influenced by the Qashqai! Hope Nissan don't take Suzuki to court over it but couldn't blame them if they did. Submitted by calidris on Wed, 2013-03-06 19:07. Totally bland Suzuki. It needs to undercut the Nissan by 2 grand and also compete on warranty. Submitted by sx4 on Thu, 2013-03-07 15:04. Smart looking if somewhat generic. Would expect a good drive also given suzuki's recent form.
