Located on a 27-acre campus in the quiet Cascade community, Southwest Arts Center is dedicated to providing quality arts instruction and programs in a positive and creative environment. The facility features classroom space, built specifically for arts instruction, visual art exhibition programming, and staged performances in the Black Box Theater. Fulton County, under the guidance of the Fulton County Department of Arts  Culture, transformed the 19,000 square-foot Southwest Arts Center into 42,000 square-foot vibrant cultural campus, with the addition of the Performance Theater  Gallery, in 2008. The Performance Theater  Gallery features a commissioned public art painting by acclaimed painter, Louis Delsarte, a 375-seat auditorium and theater, and the only fine art gallery in Southwest Fulton County.
