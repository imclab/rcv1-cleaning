Has anyone had any experience selling a car to a dealership vs. a place like CarMax? I'm not looking to buy a new car, just sell a second car that we don't use. I could also place an ad on craiglist, etc., but I've heard that is a huge hassle and might take forever.   06-19-2012, 11:52 PM 10scoachrick Location: Avery Ranch, Austin, TX 3,907 posts, read 3,924,219 times Reputation: 1453 Quote: Originally Posted by NakedApe Has anyone had any experience selling a car to a dealership vs. a place like CarMax?

CarMax will take the car and give 'top' dealer dollar only if the car is bone stock and has very little wear(at least, that's been my experience). I reckon the dealer might make an offer if the vehicle is sought after. CarMax is pretty straightforward once the process starts(in the past, anyway). Naturally, the dealers want to deal with a wholesale price so they can make their profit. In theory, a private sale should land somewhere between wholesale and used retail. Edmunds lists trade-in, private party sale and dealer retail on their site to give you some idea of the 'value' of your ride. You could also check KBB and the prices being asked on various sites, including craig's. If it's an interesting car that has a 'club' following, you might try their club site(local or regional) to find parties 'zeroed in' on your model. It seems the Volvo forum sales are pretty active for vehicles as well as parts, accessories, etc. My only local CL sale was pretty smooth except for the paperwork required by the county. I contacted someone who was LOOKING for a vehicle and made the deal. They got a pretty good deal, I sold the car in two days.

First thing to do is go to the websites like Edmunds, KBB, NADA, etc and get an estimate of what it's worth Trade-In and Private Party. Neither a car dealer or Carmax will give you more than trade-in value, and there's no guarantee there. If you're buying new, they'll deduct the cost of the trade-in from the sales price so you pay less sales taxes. Used cars are in high demand right now. Last year, we had a 2006 Civic in great condition with low miles. Dealer offered us $9000 for it and I sold it on craigslist to the first person who responded on the first day for $11000. I could have possibly gotten more if I had held out - Carmax had an identical car for sale for $16000 - can you imagine - that was almost the cost of it when it was new! I've also used Autotrader to sell cars, there's a fee, but you get better traffic. If selling a car to an individual makes you uncomfortable, by all means, sell to a dealer or Carmax. It's easy and you walk away with a check. Carmax gives you a quote that is good for 30 days I think, so go get one from them and then take it to the dealer and see if they can do better.  06-20-2012, 06:54 AM motherofthree Location: Round Rock 477 posts, read 756,016 times Reputation: 188  Not the same as just selling a car but I thought I'd share. I bought a new car last year. I went to the dealer and told them I was trading in my Honda Odyssey (had some fender bender damage) - already did my research on how much I could get. They offered $4800 - to which I laughed at and walked away from the deal. I then went to carmax and they offered me $7000. SO I went back to the dealer with the offer in hand and they then offered me $7100 for the car.  06-20-2012, 06:56 AM buffettjr 403 posts, read 366,730 times Reputation: 297  Carmax has a reputation for paying very well for used cars. They also sell at a higher price than you may be able to find haggling elsewhere. Car guys at some of the forums I visit like to sell to Carmax and buy elsewhere. BTW, although they really are no haggle when buying a car, you can haggle with them when you sell them one.  06-20-2012, 07:30 AM Trainwreck20 Location: Austin, TX 7,200 posts, read 14,024,199 times Reputation: 2640  Through a couple of sales, I have found that Carmax is the easiest and quickest way to sell a used car at a reasonable fair price. It is not the BEST price you can get, but they don't really try to totally rip you off, at least from what I see. A dealer is playing several sides to the game at once, and can often give you a 'better' price by negotiating the sales price of the new vehicle, as well. Since this is not a factor for you, I doubt you can do any better (or even as good as) Carmax. The trade-in at a dealer also saves you quite a bit on sales tax, potentially, but not an issue for you case, either. Autotrader or direct to an individual is the best price almost every time, but a lot more effort.  06-20-2012, 08:01 AM robino2001 Location: Round Rock, TX 425 posts, read 634,363 times Reputation: 92 Quote: Originally Posted by Moonlady If selling a car to an individual makes you uncomfortable, by all means, sell to a dealer or Carmax.

A carmax quote is good for 7 days. Ordered a new car and am waiting on it to come in so we're deciding what to do with the current car. Went to carmax for the appraisal just to see what it's worth - it was exactly on the blue book/edmunds trade-in value for our make/model/condition, etc. When it comes time to buy the new one, I figure if the dealer won't give me more than what carmax will, I'll keep it, try to sell it on my own for a little while to get more, then go back to carmax if a private sale never pans out.  06-20-2012, 08:54 AM 10scoachrick Location: Avery Ranch, Austin, TX 3,907 posts, read 3,924,219 times Reputation: 1453 Quote: Originally Posted by robino2001 A carmax quote is good for 7 days.

Don't forget the state sales tax amount on the trade is deducted from the total sales tax on the new vehicle. That is, you don't pay the 6.25% on the trade value. If you are trading a vehicle worth $20K, for example, you would need to sell outright for an extra $1250 to 'break even'.  06-20-2012, 09:37 AM robino2001 Location: Round Rock, TX 425 posts, read 634,363 times Reputation: 92 Quote: Originally Posted by 10scoachrick Don't forget the state sales tax amount on the trade is deducted from the total sales tax on the new vehicle.

I'm going more along the lines of a $8k trade-in price vs selling privately for $9-9.5k to make it worth the hassle. Please register to post and access all features of our very popular forum.
