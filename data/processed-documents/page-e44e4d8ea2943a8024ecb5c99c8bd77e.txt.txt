The event featured lots of documentary-style interview clips, politically incorrect GM promotional videos from the day and, the best part, live digital sketches done on the big screen by Cadillacs Christine Park (see design progression after the jump). You might be familiar with Christines exploits on Cadillac XTS, the dashing concept that precedes the brands next generation flagship. Pictured here, GMs famous Damsels of Design posed with none other than Harley Earl, GMs first VP of Design. Earl created the need for an Art and Color Division at GM and brought us the industrys first concept car, the Buick Y-Job . Wise beyond his years, Earl not only ushered in a sense of style and personalization to mass produced cars but hand picked a team of female designers to impress the papers and present a unique perspective to the design process Vintage GM video and more glorious archive pics after the jump  Photo Credit: General Motors Design Archive Description: GM Public Relations photo highlighting four of the Damsels of Design, a celebrated group of women designers that were recruited in the mid-1950s by Harley Earl, the legendary vice president of Styling at GM. Left to right: Dagmar Arnold, Gere Kavanaugh, Peggy Sauer and Jan Krebs with a 1957 Pontiac Star Chief Convertible (Custom Interior.) May 7, 1957. Check out this Converj concept car sketch progression, done in CAD, by Cadillacs Christine Park. A desktop computer projected her progress to the event audience as she penned this beauty. I captured some of the major phases, frame by frame, with my little Cannon digi.

The Damsels of Design is a huge candle on the cake of Earls career and if you want to boil down on the real Earl story, peruse the Official Harley Earl Website.

Subscribing to your feeds Reply Peter Mould Aug 5, 2011 at 2:47 am Car design and women! Why not? Women have a creative aspect and drive the motor car too, or had we forgotten. In fact I relieve believe women could design great cars, that provide added safety and look fabulous!

In the color photo, she is on the far right with Mr. Earl.. spent decades in art and design and there are still scholarships in her name! So proud!!! Reply Jan Crocker Nov 26, 2012 at 2:44 pm I am doing an exhibit on concept and dream cars for 2013 at Heritage Museums  Gardens in Sandwich, MA. Do you of any source for objects related to your aunts work at GM or that of the other Damsels of Design? I am hoping their may be family owned objects. 508-888-3300 x102 Reply RitaSue Siegel Jan 26, 2013 at 9:49 am If its not too late, Sandra Longyear married Deane Richardson who started Richardson Smith in Columbus, OH. I believe she is still alibe. Longyear was a teacher of advertising at Pratt. Did you try this avenue to get materials? There is also another one of the women in the first photo who is still alive. Let me know if you have by now been in touch with these people. Reply Susan Skarsgard Apr 18, 2013 at 11:52 am Id like to introduce myself to you. I am a designer at GM and the manager of the GM Design Archive and Special Collections. One of my personal areas of interest has been the history of women in design at GM. I have given many lectures on this subject, including the presentation at the Museum of the City of NY noted above. I have spoken with and interviewed several of the other Damsels such as Gere Kavanaugh, Jeanette Krebs and Ruth Glennie. It is so important to gather their stories and I am very interested to connect with your aunt. Could you please contact me?
