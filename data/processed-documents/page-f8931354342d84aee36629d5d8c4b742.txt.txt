Automotive    Overview The increasing availability of computational power at lower cost, an explosion of wireless communication, multiple connectivity options, and the availability of integrated intelligent sensors and actuators, are driving OEMs to devise out-of-the box strategies for delivering feature-packed vehicles that are no longer just transportation agents at competitive prices. On the other hand, stringent, compelling and conflicting mandates with respect to energy, environment, and safety dimensions such as ISO 26262 for safety critical components, or Autosar are driving OEMs and Tier1s to re-design ECUs to meet the norms. The industry is thus focusing on HEV / BEV technology, adding critical safety features and creating Autosar compliant ECUs in their next-generation vehicles. Therefore, the key challenge before automotive manufacturers is to meet competitiveness in terms of performance, durability, safety and cost, while addressing issues such as: Integration of multiple mechanical and electronic components Combining entertainment, communication and navigation technologies Coupling the world of electronics Shrinking the lifetime of electronic products to around two years, to support the increasing lifespan of an automobile to around ten years. Increasing electronics related defects in high-end vehicles Meeting the increasingly tighter regulatory and safety norms.
