When it comes down to it, there is not cheaper way to get close to exotic car performance for under 100K. I'd say #2 would be the Viper. Unfortunately the foreigners in this segment are a tad too pricey. hib96 New User| Posts: 14| Joined: 01/05 Posted: 01/25/05 07:09 PM How much money? under 40k - 350Z or G35 over 40k - 05 vette  CrunchyCookie User| Posts: 153| Joined: 01/05 Posted: 01/26/05 06:46 PM Fastest car under $30,000: Evo or STi Fastest car under $40,000: Evo or STi Fastest car under $50,000: Corvette Fastest car under $60,000: Corvette Fastest car under $70,000: Corvette Z06 Fastest car under $80,000: Corvette Z06 Fastest car under $90,000: Corvette Z06 Fastest car under $100,000: Corvette Z06 Fastest car under $100,000: Corvette Z06 Fastest car under $110,000: Corvette Z06 Fastest car under $120,000: Porsche 911 Turbo I think.  blitwack User| Posts: 102| Joined: 01/05 Posted: 01/26/05 06:52 PM Which is supposed to be faster, the new Vette Z06 or the new Viper Coupe? I've heard both do 0-60 in under 4 seconds but I haven't seen exact numbers for either one.  I'll Eat YOU Soon!!! New User| Posts: 4| Joined: 05/05 Posted: 06/01/05 09:21 AM 2005 Mustang GT- $25000, 0-60 in 4.8, quarter in 13.5  CrunchyCookie User| Posts: 153| Joined: 01/05 Posted: 06/01/05 09:48 AM Where'd you get 4.8? Highest I've seen in a legit magazine is 5 flat. As for the other question, the Corvette Z06 will easily win. The 3.9-second, 11.8-second Viper (best combined times I've seen) isn't as fast as expected for a 500-horse ride.

It should run circles around anything else out there and you just cannot break it. blitwack User| Posts: 102| Joined: 01/05 Posted: 09/22/05 05:57 PM The Z06 for now, but the SVT cobra should be the best bang for the buck, sport coupe wise, once it comes out.  evoeta New User| Posts: 2| Joined: 12/05 Posted: 12/05/05 07:41 PM if its cheap you want. 4th generation prelude, cost usd2000, handles very well for a fwd, 200hp+ na engine, 8000rpm will redline 5th gear from the factory 7400rpm, beats stock evo 6 on the motorway, very realiable, only downsde is fwd. 80-120 in 3.9secs give or take, 3rd gear.  shagypirate New User| Posts: 2| Joined: 12/05 Posted: 12/08/05 10:33 PM blitwack wrote: Which is supposed to be faster, the new Vette Z06 or the new Viper Coupe?

Also, the STi is faster than the Lancer Evo. Both all wheel drive, but the STi has more horses and more torque.  shagypirate New User| Posts: 2| Joined: 12/05 Posted: 12/08/05 10:37 PM And WTF about the 06 Cobra, its only got 450 horses compared to the Vette Z06's 500. And the Vette is still lighter. Vette is indeed and will remain fasted coupe next to the Turbo.  lethal racer New User| Posts: 5| Joined: 12/05 Posted: 12/23/05 07:10 AM id go 4 the viper. dont ask me why, i just would  1 | 2 | Next | Last PRINT EMAIL SHARE Social Web  Facebook Twitter StumbleUpon  Your browser does not support iframes  buyers guide Get a free and easy new car price quote in minutes Research Categories: Overview Cars for Sale Specs Rebates Compare Photos Quick Quote Recalls Pricing Auto Loan Reviews Warranty  Sponsored Links      Latest Auto News NHTSA Expands Chevrolet Corvette Headlight Investigation Megan Stewart on  08/27/13 01:30 PM Mazda Expands SkyActiv Engine Production Megan Stewart on  08/27/13 11:30 AM Cadillac Vsport to Claim Up to 15 Percent of XTS Sales Megan Stewart on  08/27/13 09:25 AM Refreshed Already! 2014 Range Rover Evoque Matthew Askari on  08/27/13 07:23 AM Infiniti Releases First Images of Q30 Concept Vehicle Megan Stewart on  08/26/13 10:01 PM 2014 Toyota Corolla Prices Revealed Megan Stewart on  08/26/13 09:05 PM Behind the Wheel: 2014 Toyota Corolla Keith Buglewicz on  08/26/13 09:01 PM Recovery?
