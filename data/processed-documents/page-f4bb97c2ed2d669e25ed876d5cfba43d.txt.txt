Our mission is to bring the best in live, semi- professional theater and fine arts education to the Katy community, as well as the disenfranchised and underprivileged families in the West Houston area. The Noyes Fine Arts Foundation Inc. intends to build the Katy Grand Theater and Fine Arts Academy. Our goal is to bring a high standard of performance art through productions and instruction. Our academy has university level instructors in acting, film, opera, musical theater, lighting and sound, Broadway singing as well as traditional and contemporary dance (hip hop). Our theater and fine arts academy will be designed by Studio Red Architects in Houston. Its design will appeal to a large demographic, and bring ordinary members of the community together to produce thrilling, high quality, family values live entertainment. This project also fills the need of unique evening entertainment, that will drive surrounding communities and revenue to Katy. We will make Katy, TX the new destination for quality theater and arts education. *All donations are tax deductible. Donate Recent Comments Copyright  2013 Noyes Fine Arts Foundation .
