Convertibles By Owner A convertible is a car body style with a folding or retracting roof (soft top or top in USA, or hood in UK) and are mostly 2 door models.When the top is made of a rigid material such as steel it is often referred to as a retractable hardtop instead of a convertible. In Europe a two door convertible or ÂdropheadÂ coupe may also be termed a ÂcabrioletÂ.Unlike a roadster, which may also have a soft folding top offering little protection from inclement weather, and thus called a ÂragtopÂ; a convertible has roll-up glass windows in the sides so the entire vehicle is "convertible" to an enclosed coupÃ© or sedan. Because most convertibles utilized a cloth type material, as opposed to a metal roof, the term ÂragtopÂ often used as slang for a convertible.The majority of convertibles are rear-wheel drive or front-wheel drive; however an automatic four-wheel drive convertible was introduced in the early 1980s in the AMC Eagle line. In 2003 Audi started offering its A4 Cabriolet with all-wheel drive.
