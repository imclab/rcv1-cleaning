The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) now has launched a "research factory" where new production technologies can be developed and tested. 222903108 France leads European e-car market /en/france-leads-european-e-car-market.html?cmp_id=7news_id=222903108vID=35 By far the most battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) within Europe are sold in France - probably a result of financial incentives granted by the French government. Though the largest country market for cars, Germany only ranks third - after Norway. 222903107 Engineers transfer all-wheel drive to e-bike /en/engineers-transfer-all-wheel-drive-to-e-bike.html?cmp_id=7news_id=222903107vID=35 All-wheel drive is something for off-road vehicles and SUVs, right? A team of developers and researchers of the Ulm University believes that also two-wheel vehicles could benefit from all-wheel drive. An additional electric drive on the front wheel could make them more agile and safe. Now they are developing a prototype. 222903106 Apple's iOS7: Too little, too late for automotive market, says expert /en/apple-s-ios7-too-little-too-late-for-automotive-market-says-expert.html?cmp_id=7news_id=222903106vID=35 At its recent developer conference WWDC, Apple pitched its new operation system iOS7 for automotive deployment. Now Frost & Sullivan expert Krishna Jayaraman got granular on Apple's system software. Though iOS7 offers significant improvements with regards to the interfaces and better voice control functions for the SIRI personal assistant, the announcement came much too late for the automotive market, Jayaraman said.
