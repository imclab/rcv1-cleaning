Tickets are available at mctinc.org or by calling (406) 728-7529. Tickets are $21. The film version of “Steel Magnolias” has a reputation for being sad, but Missoula Community Theatre wants to emphasize that Robert Harling’s original play is very funny, even though it contains serious underpinnings. “The gentleman wrote it when his sister died of diabetes,” said director T.J. Charlson. “The short story was kind of cathartic, but it didn’t really sell.” When he adapted it into a play, he finished it quickly because he said it wasn’t fiction, but a “remembrance,” Charlson said. “He stresses that the characters are human, and Southern women have a little bit of resilience, yet charm and delicacy at the same time.” The six female characters congregate in Truvy’s Beauty Parlor in small-town Louisiana, where they trade banter and gossip. “They’ve known each other their whole lives, and in the beauty parlor they feel their second home – they feel free to swap recipes, literally and figuratively, not gossiping but swapping information,” he said. The play takes place in four different scenes, although Charlson likes to think of them as “seasons,” but in a figurative sense. The first takes place at a wedding; the second a birth; the third involves dialysis for the new mother; and in the final scene someone’s passed away. “So it’s their evolution. How these things affect their lives with this one girl’s death, but life in general – how they deal with difficulties,” Charlson said. “With grace and a lot of humor. It’s very funny.” It’s a tight ensemble script, he said. “Six fantastic actresses, but they’re all in every scene. They have a reliance upon each other for their lines, they’re relying on emotional support for their characters, but it turns out they’ve gotten to each other the past six weeks and really bonded. They trust each other.” The setting – a beauty parlor in the 1980s – called for some research from costume designer Erica Chandler and set designer Teresa Jensen. However, they had a little help from donors. “One thing about a community theater, we have a lot of support from people who give donations, and a lot of ’80s clothes get donated,” Charlson said. As for the set, it’s a convincing re-creation of a 1980s decor. “It’s got some homey touches, said Charlson, a native of North Carolina. “The designers did a lot of research.” Right down to the spoon collection on the wall.
