You can mention a few places in FL, like Tampa or Miami, but the simple fact is that it rains a lot there, and that is not good for car meets or car culture. Dallas is much better than either of those cities. The only places I can think of that either beat or rival Dallas is LA, San Diego, or Scottsdale, with an honorable mention going to Atlanta.   07-27-2013, 08:20 AM asubram3 Location: Beaverton, OR 1,498 posts, read 858,716 times Reputation: 604  Dallas definitely is right up there. Everything from 20 year old Oldsmobiles to latest Porsches thrive there.  07-27-2013, 05:24 PM nightleopard654 Location: Stuart, FL 72 posts, read 9,748 times Reputation: 65  What about Houston, TX? I hear the car scene there is pretty decent. Can anybody verify this, or is it all hype?  07-27-2013, 05:30 PM MrWillys Location: Cold Springs, NV 947 posts, read 281,772 times Reputation: 991  We don't have the most, but Hot August Nights starts on the 6th of August this year. All the Casino's and downtown will be packed with people from all over the country. Welcome to Hot August Nights  07-27-2013, 05:43 PM nightleopard654 Location: Stuart, FL 72 posts, read 9,748 times Reputation: 65 Quote: Originally Posted by gbugmiami It also depends what kind of cars you are into.

(like hot rods arent big in miami, but big in daytona, ricers are kinda everywhere, lowriders are big in Ca and kinda everywhere to a point). That's a good point. My tastes include anything fast or anything custom (modern custom, so not really like custom hot rods but really more like cars w/ pimped-out sound systems and custom rims). I'm still open to including classics, etc. in my definition of car culture, but fast/modern custom cars are what I lean towards.  07-27-2013, 05:56 PM American Luxury Location: Cincinnati, OH 724 posts, read 170,360 times Reputation: 549  I can't believe nobody has mentioned Detroit. Anywhere in southern California is right up there as well.  07-27-2013, 07:17 PM sdlife619 Location: San Diego A.K.A D.A.Y.G.O City 840 posts, read 1,099,261 times Reputation: 503  Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego are definitely very car centric places that are heavily focused on what you drive represents who you are kind of mentality. CA is very pretentious and materialistic. We care more about our homes and cars, than our own family it seems like! You will see tons and tons of BMW's, Mercedes, Audi's and everything else in between in SoCal. The further east you go, the more Rednecky it get's, so lifted trucks, and trucks in general are more apparent towards the desert and mountains in SoCal. It's the complete opposite near the coast where you'll mostly see a higher number of luxury cars. Suburbs in middle-class neighborhoods are mix between your typical Camry, to a Beemer 3-series-5-series. But definitely we have cars here from all walks of life, but I will say compared to the rest of the nation, California has more newer cars on the road than in other states from my experience. You'll hardly see any 80's cars on the road anymore out here, they're pretty much extinct unless you live in the hood, but even then, there just not around. 90's cars are still around, but they are slowly going away as well. Brand new cars are everywhere in SoCal.  07-27-2013, 09:03 PM ram2 3,230 posts, read 1,477,970 times Reputation: 1240 Quote: Originally Posted by Cardiff Giant Can't mention car culture without Detroit and its suburbs.

Brand new cars are everywhere in SoCal. Driving around LA for a day is the greatest car show you could ever see! I was in town last December and saw a weird new BMW sitting right in front of the directors guild/union, I later learned it was the new 4 series. Driving the Beverly Hills area is great, the Mercedes and BMW's are the Camrys there. It's always fun to see the awesome but kinda hideous looking Bugatti Veyron parked on Rodeo Drive  Please register to post and access all features of our very popular forum. It is free and quick.
