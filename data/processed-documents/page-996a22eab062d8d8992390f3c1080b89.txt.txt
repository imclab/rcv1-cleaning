The kind ofgrown-ups who think it’s hilarious when puppets lampoon fringetopics like Internet porn, racism and high-decibel sex. The racy puppet show, playing in Billings on March 9, is one ofthe freshest productions to score on Broadway in recent years. Itearned three Tony Awards in 2004 before closing in 2009 after 2,534shows only to open six weeks later as an off-Broadway production.Teenagers and people in their early 20s have especially embracedthe show’s counter-culture banter and bawdy humor. But one of thecreators, Robert Lopez, points out that senior citizens laugh justas hard because, after all, “in order to get to 75, you have to be25.” Another “Avenue Q” creator, Jeff Marx, interned at “SesameStreet” early in his career and some of the original cast memberswere “Sesame Street” performers. So the comparisons between the twopuppet shows are deserving, if unnerving. Two “Avenue Q” puppets, Rod and Nicky, are reminiscent of SesameStreet’s Bert and Ernie and Trekki Monster’s voice and dispositionare pure Cookie Monster, only without the cookie fetish. But“Avenue Q” puppets are singing songs with titles like “If You WereGay,” “Everyone’s a Little Bit Racist” and “I’m Not WearingUnderwear Today.” While “Sesame Street” uses simplistic characters and melodies topunctuate lessons learned by children, “Avenue Q” features youngadults bumbling through real-life problems where there are noclear-cut solutions. Performer Lisa Helmi Johanson, who portrays one of three humancharacters in the touring production of “Avenue Q,” told TheGazette in a recent telephone interview that the show has moredepth than puppets making dirty jokes. “There are heartfelt moments that are touching and beautifulbecause of the message they send,” Johanson said. “Trekki Monsterhas a few of my favorite comedic moments, but because we have newactors this time around, different situations and different linestickle me in a new ways.” Johanson’s character is Christmas Eve, an Asian woman whostruggles with English. She is also a therapist without anyclients. Johanson, who is of Finnish and Korean heritage, said“Avenue Q” travels well across North America where Americans andCanadians both relate to the humor. But in Japan, where the showtoured last year, humor was lost in translation or maybe theaudience was too polite to laugh. “They gave us presents, they took pictures, they came backmultiple times and brought the pictures, but I’m not sure theyunderstood the show,” said Johanson, 25. “It made me realize howAmerican this show is.” The show’s creators invented characters like themselves who weresearching for purpose in life while they encountered adultproblems. Part of the show’s humor stems from knowing that in“Sesame Street” and other children’s television shows everythingturns out, but in “Avenue Q” and in real life, that isn’t alwaysthe case. Lopez is now working with the creators of “South Park,” TreyParker and Matt Stone, to produce the comedic musical “The Book ofMormon” on Broadway. It opens this month. One reviewer has already dubbed it another “smart, crudelyprovocative hit that bucks the tradition of the Great WhiteWay.” Contact Jaci Webb at 657-1359 or jwebb@billingsgazette.com Contact Jaci Webb at 657-1359 or jwebb@billingsgazette.com Tags Avenue Q , Boradway , Tony Awards , Robert Lopez , Jeff Marx , Sesame Street View Comments Related Stories Giveaway: Join Jaci at tonight's racy puppet show More Theatre stories Jody Grant named new ABT head of marketing, corporate relations Benefit event Trailhead Brew  Chew set for Sept. 7 Gaelic Storm to play Babcock, tickets on sale Monday Pop star Sparks appreciates her 'Speezys,' views Houston as 'guardian angel' Recommendations Sponsored Links Copyright 2013 The Billings Gazette.
