Photo by Dave Harp The State of Maryland is proud to be among the first states in the country to sponsor Arts and Entertainment Districts as a way to stimulate the economy and improve quality of life. This legislation enables local jurisdictions, municipalities, counties, or a combination thereof, to apply for state designations for the Arts and Entertainment Districts within their boundaries and offer tax incentives as provided by law. Nationally Arts and Entertainment (AE) Districts can be found in cities and towns of all sizes each one is uniquely reflecting a local mission, history, and cultural development. Some districts succeed with thoughtful landscaping and signage, while others are involved in the renovation of existing buildings and attracting complimentary businesses. Many are found in downtown areas, but they can flourish in suburban, rural, and neighborhood locations as well. The components of a successful arts and entertainment district are its location, management, content and funding.
