Look at the listings here six months from now, see if they are what you are looking for and then get that application. Time is a wastin. Posted by: Connie Mettler | April 11, 2008 at 05:42 PM Hi, I am an artist and I would like to display/sell my art at these art shows. but the art shows mentioned above donot have any links, steps to enter/participate in the art fair, contact person or anything...can someone help please! Posted by:ChicagoArtist | July 21, 2008 at 11:21 AM Find the show in the list that you want to do, google that name and then reach out to the organization that produces it. Good luck. Posted by: Connie Mettler | July 24, 2008 at 12:11 PM I see a couple of the ones I like in the near Chicago suburbs but it doesnt provide information or link as to the cost of becoming a vendor or if table is included. I cant afford 100 dollars for a booth. Posted by: Betty Huang | September 14, 2008 at 10:48 PM Hi Betty, You have found an art fair that sounds good to you? Then google the name of that art fair and contact the organizers for the details. Best of luck in the art fair biz! Posted by: Constance Mettler | September 16, 2008 at 04:25 PM Please add to the calendar: 11th Annual Chicago Art Open Sponsored by the Chicago Artists Coalition October 3-19, 2008 Merchandise Mart, 8th Fl. The Chicago Art Open is the largest, most diverse survey of Chicagoland artists and a centerpiece of Chicago Artists Month.

Posted by: David | September 24, 2008 at 12:02 AM I have a correction to the craft fair at the Odeum in Villa Park, Illinois. I attended the winter fair (not to be missed!)and picked up a flier for the Spring Festival and my friends and I already have it on our calendars. It states the fair will be April 24, 25, and 26, not the weekend of the 18th through the 20th as listed on your site. The same company does one in April in Omaha, the 17th-19. Posted by:Peg Luebbing | January 16, 2009 at 08:26 AM Thank you so much, Peg. I really appreciate this information. Any time you find an error Id love to hear from you. This one will be corrected soon. Posted by: Connie Mettler | January 16, 2009 at 12:30 PM Oh wow! This is a really great resource. Ive been an artist for all my life but just made the jump (thanks to my pushy life coach girlfriend) to serioulsy tooting it as a career. I look forward to taking advantage of all this site has to offer. Thanks! Posted by: Miguel Angel Menendez Jr. | February 19, 2009 at 10:55 PM Are the Dates posted on this site for the current year? Or do the dates remain the same for 2010? Posted by: Allysum | March 20, 2009 at 03:23 PM Allysum, the dates change every year -- the site tries to be accurate, but it well worth your while to check the date of an event before you leave home to attend. Posted by: Connie Mettler | March 23, 2009 at 05:22 PM Hi, I think you do a great job with this, however, it would make things a lot easier for us if you would post the streets and intersections where the art fairs are being held - thanks! Posted by:Barbara Banas | June 06, 2009 at 10:24 AM I make primitive dolls and crafts, my website is www.theprimitivegirls.com and I am from Robinson, Illinois and was wondering if there is any shows around me. Posted by: amy drum | May 25, 2010 at 05:44 PM Barbara, we try to add specific information, such as intersections, when we can find the information ourselves. Posted by: Jacki Bilsborrow | May 29, 2010 at 09:15 AM Amy, we have listed many shows in the state of Illinois. You would need to look on a map to see how close they are to you. We have shows listed in neighboring state, as well. Check those, too. Good Luck. Posted by: Jacki Bilsborrow | May 29, 2010 at 10:18 AM Hi everyone: Any tips on where to do a show in Nov. in the Chicago or suburban area? Ive done 2 big shows  a couple small ones as a fairly new beader. I also might be interested in sharing a booth.

Posted by: Jacki Bilsborrow | June 14, 2010 at 10:13 AM There was a posting for an art fair on July 11th in Plainfield Illinois. My wife and I drove to Plainfield to enjoy the fair and it wasnt there. What gives? Posted by: Laurent & Kim Suderow | July 12, 2010 at 09:20 AM Laurent and Kim, I am so sorry that you drove to a show we had listed and found nothing there. We try very hard to make sure all our listings are correct. I am trying to get to the bottom of this and figure out what went wrong. Thanks for alerting us to the problem so that we can make sure our info is correct. I hope you will be able to find another good show to visit this summer.
