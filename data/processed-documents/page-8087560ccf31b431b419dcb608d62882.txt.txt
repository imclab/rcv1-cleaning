Art on the Avenue, an art hop and music festival, encourages people to take a drive down Smith (from the High Bridge over the Mississippi River in St. Paul to Dodd Road in West St. Paul) and check out the art displayed in local business. Live music and family activities are also part of the festivities. Christine Shyne, executive director of the West Side Community Organization (WSCO), says the idea for Art on the Avenue came out of the Smith Avenue Revitalization Plan as a way to draw attention to the St. Paul street. She notes it has been a "struggle" at times to keep the area vital. "We had been trying to gather and organize artists on the West Side, so it was a nice serendipitous coming together of goals," says Shyne, who is spearheading the event. Folks are encouraged to look for "Art Here" lawn signs along Smith indicating which businesses are displaying art. Art on the Avenue is taking place mostly on the West Side, but also goes a bit into West St. Paul. "We're hoping the lawn signs bring some attention and people will slow down and take a look at some of the business," says Shyne. "We're also hoping it will give the artists some exposure and maybe develop some relationships between the artists and the businesses." Things start Friday (6-10 p.m.) with an event opening at Highbridge Tattoo and music and art at Amore Coffee. On Saturday (noon-10 p.m.) there's a bicycle scavenger hunt, art and music throughout the day, along with children's craft activities, at Smith and Morton (noon-4 p.m.). One of the hands-on events is an interactive art car project in which Shyne is letting folks to decorate her van in a way that represents the West Side. "I'm allowing my van to become an art car," she laughs. "It's an old '97 Plymouth Voyager, so it's not a very attractive van. It'll be an improvement."
