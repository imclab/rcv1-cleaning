Thanks to the brand's improvement in quality, reasonable price tags, high-quality parts, and an industry-leading warranty, Hyundai has expanded its reach and now presents various models in more upscale segments than it has traditionally competed in. The luxury-minded Genesis Coupe is a good example. For its first generation, the Genesis Coupe is equipped with a base 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine good for 210 horsepower and 223 pounds-per-foot of torque. A bolder 306 hp V6 can also be found in the lineup, and both engines are mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission with a five-speed automatic also available as an option. As for the model's dimensions, the Hyundai Genesis measures in with a wheelbase of 111 inches, a width of 73.4 inches, a height of 54.3 inches, and an overall length of 182.3 inches. A whopping seven trim levels are available for the Hyundai Genesis Coupe: 2.0T, 2.0T Premium, 2.0T Track, 2.0T R-Spec, 3.8, 3.8 Grand Touring, and 3.8 Track. Trim levels are named according to their engine (2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder and the 3.8L V6). The entry-level 2.0T is outfitted with such standard Hyundai parts as 18 alloy wheels, power accessories, cruise control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, Bluetooth capability, a CD/MP3 audio system with iPod/USB connectivity, and steering-wheel mounted controls. Premium versions of the Genesis Coupe offer a power-driver's seat, keyless ignition, a sunroof, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The Track is the sports-performance variant and is geared up with Brembo brakes, a rear spoiler, a sport-tuned suspension, Xenon headlights, foglamps, a limited-slip differential, and red cloth seat inserts. R-Spec models take the Track even further in terms of performance, as it is designed to keep a lighter-weight feel and does not offer such ameinities and accessories as Bluetooth, automatic headlights, cruise control, and etc. The 3.8 Genesis Coupe trims receive fog lights, chrome fascia accents, automatic climate control, and black leather upholstery as standard. The Grand Touring piles on with rear parking sensors, xenon HID headlights, heated side mirrors, and a heated front seat. The 3.8 Track mirrors its 2.0T namesake in terms of equipment, with the main differences lying in the engine configuration. When it comes to safety, the Genesis Coupe is geared up with a sizeable amount of standard Hyundai parts and features including four-wheel antilock brakes, stability control, traction control, a depowered airbags, side airbags, and front airbags. Smooth style is the order of the day when it comes to the Genesis Coupe.

From then on, the Genesis Coupe is recognized as the old-fashioned model. Even though the bodywork is still eye-catching, it's now lacking the wow factor it used to have. According to Hyundai Motor America CEO John Krafcik, 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe will be given a more dramatic changeover. Its exterior will be restyled even more than the Sedan's, he stated at a launch event for the Genesis Sedan in Detroit. This restyling is a part of Hyundais mission to remain on top of automotive design. As per Krafcik, he wants to keep on delivering progressive attractive designs which will be inspiring, not a step back. While the Genesis Sedan received a new 8-speed automatic transmission and a more powerful V6 engine, the Coupe is expected to get the same engine, producing 333-hp. It is actually a good bump in power over the outgoing V-6 engine, that made 306-hp. Moreover, the Genesis Coupe will now top its six-cylinder pony-car rivals, such as Chevy Camaro offering 312-hp, Ford Mustang, and Dodge Challenger both carrying 305-hp sixes under their hoods. The 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe is getting the brands new Bluelink telematics system as well. Switch to the mobile version Full Site Copyright  2003-2013 CARiD.com. All rights reserved.
