Still, a car seat needs to do only one thing, and do it well: it needs to cushion your childs body safely in your car. So, how do you make an essential baby product even better? By making it easier to use, of course! The Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat improves on other car seat models by making it easier than ever to install correctly. The ReclineSure 9-position Leveling System and the totally impressive SuperCinch LATCH System take all of the guesswork and yanking out of car seat installation, giving you more time to do important things like enjoying how cute and cuddly your baby is. The SuperCinch LATCH System really is a game-changer: integrated pulleys quadruple the force of your pull, so it takes virtually no install your car seat tightly (and therefore, properly). Just follow the directions on the straps  labeled Pull 1st and Pull 2nd  and youve got a rock-solid car seat installation in seconds. This makes the Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat the perfect seat for a family whose car seat is always moving around  perhaps from Moms car to Dads car, or from Grandmas car to the babysitters car. The multiple recline positions also make this car seat a fantastic choice for kids with special needs, who might require a bit more recline in their car seat. The Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat can be used from 5-40 pounds rear-facing, and the 9 recline positions will help you keep your rear-facing child comfortable for longer. You can switch this car seat to forward-facing starting at 22 pounds, up to 65 pounds and 50 inches (but remember, rear-facing is safest!). An included infant insert snuggles newborns up to 11 pounds, and a two-position crotch strap helps to keep the NextFit car seat comfy for kids of all sizes. Reviewers love how the harness width on this car seat expands to accommodate wider shoulders as your child grows; it also adjusts automatically when you raise the car seat headrest, which has six heights. With all of these comfort and installation details, its easy to forget that the Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat is also supremely protective: the steel frame is designed to manage crash forces, and the car seat and headrest are packed with EPS foam for Side Impact Protection. So, the NextFit 65 Convertible Car Seat is the car seat with the entire package  safety, comfort, and ease of use.
