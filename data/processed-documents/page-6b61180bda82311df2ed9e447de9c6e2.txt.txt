Here are some points to consider: How much does your baby presently weigh? If youre looking for a car seat for your newborn 6-pound bundle of joy, the Graco ComfortSport might seem to be a good choice, as the idea of your child weighing over forty pounds seems centuries away! On the other hand, if you have a hefty toddler, youll want a car seat with a high upper weight limit, such as the Diono Radian R120, which goes up to 80 lbs. Is extended rear-facing (ERF) important to you? Years ago, most parents faced their babies towards the rear of the car until 12 months or 20 lbs. Now, the safety recommendations are to keep your child rear-facing until age 2, and the longer the better. Look at the chart to see which car seats offer rear facing weight limits of 35 lbs, 40 lbs, and beyond. Will you have other passengers in the same row as this car seat? If youll have other children ride alongside this car seat, whether theyll be strapped in a regular seat-belt or in another car seat of their own, you want to consider the width of the car seat youre about to buy. The Combi Coccoro has one of the narrowest profiles, at just 15 inches wide. Most convertibles are about 17  21 inches wide. Whats your budget? Youll often get extra conveniences and an easier-to-use car seat when you pay more money, but a higher price does not equal a higher level of safety. Determine your budget for a convertible car seat and stick with it. Prices constantly vary; ranges of prices in the chart above are accurate as of the end of 2012.
