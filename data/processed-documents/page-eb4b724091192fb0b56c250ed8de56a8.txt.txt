The Encore is on display at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit through Jan. 22, and goes on sale in early 2013. Buick Encore is a great-looking, smart choice for those who want luxury crossover amenities in a more maneuverable and agile vehicle, said Tony DiSalle, U.S. vice president of Buick Marketing. It represents a luxury alternative for a new audience of Buick customers, and delivers features and flexibility not typically found in vehicles of its size today. Buick models continue to gain in popularity, with two consecutive years of higher retail sales. The Encore joins Verano  Buicks third all-new sedan in three years  to round out the brands lineup and continues the momentum established by the Enclave crossover almost five years ago. With room for five and up to 48.4 cubic feet (1,372 liters) of storage space with the rear seat folded, the Encore offers substantial cargo capacity along with the confident, higher driving position, all-wheel-drive capability and contemporary styling of a crossover. In fact, its cargo space compares favorably against similar-sized international competitors:  Rear Seat in Place Rear Seat Folded Buick Encore 18.8 cu. ft. / 533 liters 48.4 cu. ft. / 1,372 liters BMW X1 16.9 cu. ft. / 480 liters 47.4 cu. ft. / 1,350 liters Audi Q3 16.2 cu. ft. / 460 liters 48.2 cu. ft. / 1,365 liters Additional features include 10 standard air bags and an Ecotec 1.4L turbo four-cylinder/six-speed automatic powertrain, along with standard and available technologies such as Buicks voice-activated IntelliLink  which uses Bluetooth or a USB to connect the drivers smartphone to a high-resolution, full-color seven-inch LCD display radio. And because its a Buick, QuietTuning is standard on the Encore, which also features Buicks first use of active noise cancellation technology. Contemporary design offers versatile spaciousness In keeping with the global design language that has come to symbolize the brand, the Encores sculpted and elegant styling traits  including sweeping character lines  make it instantly identifiable as a contemporary Buick. Signature cues include a waterfall grille, chrome accents and surrounds, portholes on the hood and painted lower panels, similar to the Enclave. The Encore brings Buicks timeless, sculptural design to the crossover segment in a way that blends elegance, efficiency and utility, said David Lyon, executive director of design. Theres confidence in its athletic stance and elemental beauty in its rich details. Blue-accented projector-beam headlamps and detailed taillamps enhance the premium appearance; and 18-inch, five-spoke painted aluminum wheels are standard. Seven-spoke chrome wheels are available. Inside, the Encores organic styling carries over to a flowing instrument panel that wraps naturally into the door panels. A prominent central instrument panel houses the large, full-color, seven-inch LCD display for the IntelliLink voice-activated radio system. It also features displays for the SiriusXM satellite radio, as well as available navigation and rear camera systems. A contemporary mix of dark and light tones distinguishes the cabin, which is accented with ice blue ambient lighting, select use of bright trim and wood-grain trim. Premium seats featuring high-density foam for greater comfort on long drives are trimmed with either a contemporary cloth/leatherette motif or available leather. Heated front seats and a heated steering wheel are available. The rear seat features a fold-down armrest with cup holders. More of the Encores comfort and luxury features  standard and available  include: Remote vehicle start Dual-zone automatic climate control Rainsense wipers Bose premium sound system Heated, leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls Six-way, power-adjustable drivers seat with power lumbar adjustment and driver memory. Encore also features plenty of storage capacity and storage compartments. It offers 18.8 cubic feet (533 liters) of storage behind the split-folding rear seat and 48.4 cubic feet (1,372 liters) with the rear seat folded. With the rear seat in place, theres room for at least six full grocery bags and with the rear seat folded, theres room for golf clubs and overnight bags for a weekend getaway. Even the front passenger seat folds flat to extend the cargo length and accommodate long items that would not normally fit in a vehicle of this size. Nine exterior colors and three interior color combinations will be offered. QuietTuning gets active QuietTuning is the process of defining Buick quality, sound and vibration characteristics and designing and refining the vehicle following a three-point strategy of reducing sounds at their source, blocking sounds from entering the cabin and absorbing any remaining sounds. For the Encore, specific content was applied to achieve 40 sound benchmarks for refinement, including Buicks first application of active noise cancellation. With it, ceiling-mounted microphones detect engine noise, the frequencies of which are processed by a computer that directs counteracting sound waves through the audio systems speakers and subwoofer. Additional standard QuietTuning features include: Acoustically treated headliner with a tuned gap between it and the high-strength-steel roof panel Sound-absorbing materials used in the cabin, under the hood and in the wheel house liners HydraMatic 6T40 six-speed transmission with neutral gear disengagement Quiet-tuned 18-inch Continental tires Aero-optimized outside mirrors Ultra-quiet engine alternator Acoustic-laminated windshield and thicker 5mm side window glass Foam baffle insulation at the opening of body structure cavities. One-tire philosophy sharpens ride and handling characteristics The new Encore is built on a global small-crossover platform and engineered with a one-tire philosophy. Everything is optimized around a single 18-inch tire specification, designed for more precise suspension tuning, driving refinement, quietness and a feeling of control. The Encores 100.6-inch (2,555 mm) wheelbase and wide stance  60.6-inch (1,540 mm) front and rear tracks  contribute to a more confident-feeling driving experience, while a strong structure enables greater suspension precision and a quieter ride. Tuned engine, including two hydraulic mounts, are tailored to the engines inherent torque axis to disrupt the transmission of vibration and noise. This configuration also helps control the transfer of momentum, resulting in improved dynamic balance. A MacPherson strut front suspension is used with coil springs, a large stabilizer bar and side-load-compensated front strut modules. The rear suspension incorporates a compound crank (torsion beam) design, with a double-wall, tubular V-shape beam profile with gas-charged twin-tube shocks. It combines all the advantages of a conventional torsion beam axle, including minimal space requirements, with low weight and consistent camber control. Urethane spring isolators are used to dampen noise. The Encore also features a column-mounted, variable-effort electric power steering system. It contributes to a 36.7-foot (11.2 meters) turning diameter, while also saving fuel compared to an engine-driven power steering pump. Safety technology helps protect occupants Encore is designed with technologies  including radar-based features  to help avoid crashes and protect occupants in case one occurs. Technologies that help avoid them include: Standard StabiliTrak electronic stability control Four-wheel disc brakes with ABS and electronic brake force distribution Cornering brake control and brake assist Available all-wheel-drive system that seamlessly shifts power to the rear wheels when required for better traction and handling Available forward collision alert and lane departure warning Available front and rear park assist Available rear vision camera. When it comes to occupant protection, the Encores body structure forms a protective cage around the passenger compartment. Sixty-three percent of the underbody structure is comprised of high-strength steels, while 57 percent of the upper body uses high-strength steels, including ultra-high-strength steel. That protection is complemented with 10 standard air bags, which include: Driver and front passenger frontal air bags Driver and front passenger knee air bags Front and rear thorax air bags (all outboard positions) Side curtain air bags for front and rear outboard passengers. Encores suite of safety features is rounded out with exclusive OnStar technology, which includes the Advanced Crash Response System, emergency assistance and more. Ecotec turbo engine drives efficiency The Buick Encore is powered by an efficient, power-dense Ecotec 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission. It generates an estimated 140 horsepower (103 kW) and 148 lb.-ft. of torque (200 Nm) between 1,850 rpm and 4,900 rpm. The wide rpm range for the maximum torque  a specific trait of turbocharged engines  helps it deliver a better driving experience and performance. The 1.4Ls turbocharger is integrated within the exhaust manifold, for reduced weight and greater packaging flexibility. A reinforced crankshaft and forged connecting rods deliver additional strength to support the engines pressurized power and torque over a wide rpm band. Several of the engines features contribute to the Encores overall fuel efficiency, including: A high-efficiency alternator Regulated voltage control Electronically controlled returnless fuel system Deceleration fuel cut-off. They complement other vehicle-wide systems and components that also help improve efficiency, including low-rolling-resistance tires, electric power steering, neutral idle feature and optimized aerodynamics. A Hydra-Matic 6T40 six-speed automatic transmission backs the Ecotec 1.4L turbo engine. It is part of a family of six-speed front and all-wheel drive transaxles developed for small cars and crossovers. It has a unique design, with the planetary gearsets positioned on the same axis as the engine crankshaft centerline, making the entire powertrain unit shorter fore-to-aft. This design enables a shorter overall vehicle length, increased interior space, enhanced safety crush zones and lower weight. The Hydra-Matic 6T40 offers a steep first gear and a tall overdrive top gear to achieve a wide ratio spread of 6.14:1. This allows the Encore to achieve robust acceleration, as well as fuel efficiency and lower engine noise at highway cruising speeds. A neutral-gear disengagement feature helps enhance smoothness and efficiency. The Buick Encore will begin arriving at U.S. Buick dealerships in the first quarter of 2013.

It looks fine but I wouldn't have made it a Buick, doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of their lineup. Chevy would've been better.  PlanB ( View Profile ) Posted on 1/10/2012 2:10:19 PM | reply to this comment | Votes: 1 Buick, focus on Lexus. Do not make same mistake as Cadillac. MB,BMW, Audi and Infiniti customer bases are too different from Buick. But Lexus demographics are the ticket.  Dr550 ( View Profile ) Posted on 1/10/2012 3:20:41 PM | reply to this comment | Votes: 3 Agreed. When was the last time you saw someone cross-shopping a BMW and a Buick (except maybe in China)? This thing looks very cartoon-ish - can't really see who in the U.S. would be a target buyer. Younger folks won't go for Buick, older people don't shop for micro cute utes.  Dustbuster ( View Profile ) Posted on 1/10/2012 4:02:11 PM | | Votes: 1 that's an oddly proportioned vehicle from the outside -- it looks like someone photocopied a picture of a Smart on 200% and stuck a Buick grill on it. With that said the inside looks nice. Buick has come a long way with their interiors.  JRobUSC ( View Profile ) Posted on 1/10/2012 5:18:59 PM | reply to this comment | Votes: 2 Agree, a little too bubly looking which makes sense since it's an overinflated Sonic. Not ugly but just a bit awkward looking. The interior looks really nice in the press shots.  chewy ( View Profile ) Posted on 1/10/2012 7:27:10 PM | | Votes: 2 It has the Nissan Juke's lines, so that makes it ugly.  Designer1 ( View Profile ) Posted on 1/10/2012 5:20:47 PM | reply to this comment | Votes: 3 The only people that will buy this car instead of throwing their money at BMW, VW, or Audi are mid-westerners that don't like things that come from other countries. Besides price, there is nothing in the styling that would draw or prestige in the vehicle or the brand that would lure a potential BMW or Audi buyer to cross-shop this vehicle.
