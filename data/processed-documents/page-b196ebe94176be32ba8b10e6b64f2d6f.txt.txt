Equipped with a 2.0-liter I-4 engine, the Suzuki SX4 Crossover comes with either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Boasting an airy cabin, Garmin Nuvi navigation system, and loads of features, the Suzuki SX4 Crossover provides function and versatility. The crossover's safety equipment is above average, especially on crash tests, and its fuel economy rates in the 23 mpg city / 29 mpg highway range.  New for 2010  For 2010, the Suzuki SX4 Crossover received re-styling, a more powerful 150-horsepower 2.0-liter engine, and a pair of new transmissions: a six-speed manual transmission and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Interior features were also upgraded.  Essentials Engine : 2.0L I-4 Transmissions : 6-speed manual, CVT Body Style : 4-door hatchback Trim : Base Sport Utility  On the Outside  The Suzuki SX4 Crossover received an updated front fascia and new wheels for 2010.  From the Inside  Sporting a new instrument cluster, a height-adjustable driver seat, and new navigation features, the Suzuki SX4 Crossover features a quality interior, built with reliable materials, and head and leg room for tall drivers.  Driving Performance  Because the Suzuki SX4 Crossover's optional all-wheel drive adds over 100 pounds to its curb weight, the hatchback feels less nimble and slower to respond than the front-wheel drive configuration. However, the new 2.0-liter engine with 150-horsepower is an improvement, as are the new six-speed manual transmission and CVT.  Safety Equipment  Standard safety systems on the Suzuki SX4 Crossover include stability control, as well as driver and front passenger front, side, and curtain airbags.  Gas Mileage  Crossover FWD, SportBack GTS: 22 mpg city/30 mpg highway Crossover FWD, Crossover Technology FWD, SportBack GTS (CVT): 23 mpg city/30 mpg highway Crossover AWD: 22 mpg city/20 mpg highway (manual) Crossover AWD, Crossover Technology AWD, Crossover Touring AWD: 23 mpg city/29 mpg highway  Plusses All-wheel drive Plenty of interior features New engine and transmissions  Minuses Heavier curb weight with AWD Engine still short on power  Rating  An economical four-door hatch with AWD option  People Who Like the 2010 Suzuki SX4 Crossover Also Like Dodge Caliber Mini Countryman Nissan Rouge Subaru Impreza 2.5 See the New 2013 SX4 Crossover.
