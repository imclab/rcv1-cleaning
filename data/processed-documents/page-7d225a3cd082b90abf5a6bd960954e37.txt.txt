The Z3 M Coupe was pretty much identical to the Z3  M Roadster except for the awkward looking fixed roof.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- External  review by Anon.  Your comment about the awkward fixed roof is ridiculous.  The roof line is what gives the car such visual appeal.
