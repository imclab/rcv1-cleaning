Bonus bars Bruno Mars is back dropping that heat, Rihanna felt a way when Drake took the stage, sweet, Kevin hart cracked jokes, he be saying the craziest thangs, Twitter is going to be on FIRE all day tomorrow morning. Oh yea Lady Gaga in a thong tho, kicking down doors, Katy Perry going in and make the fans go ROAR. Question: Did you watch the MTV VMAs ?

FIELD OFDREAMS August 23, 2013 by Jixi Fox in Poetry and tagged Art , blogging , fiction , Inspiration , Literature , Philosophy , Poems , poetry , Psychology , writing | Leave a comment FIELD OF DREAMS Dreamers lack fear  tears but birth aspirations, Living in the fields and feeling pain, Their eyes read, and their heart write, We live pieces of their lives as tears reach our eyes. In the field of dreams anything is possible, We create art here, we breathe the air, We release our fear and we tear up in love, So we stay in our safe havens and fly above.

IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THERIDE August 22, 2013 by Jixi Fox in Humor , Poetry and tagged Art , blogging , Cars , fiction , Inspiration , Literature , Poems , poetry , Video Games , writing | Leave a comment IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE RIDE - Only if you are lucky, we would go out for a ride, No matter where we go as long as I am inside, So you try your best to call out for shotgun, Because its time to rollout we about to have some fun, Im talking on the cell, while the music is blasting, I look in the backseat someone is twerking and dancing, We just blew by a stop sign , fast car like we Need for Speed , We about to go to jail, cops behind us, because of this weed.
