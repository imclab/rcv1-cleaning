Luckily we sometimes get the joke. Can you name any? Reply  You can no longer comment on this thread as it was closed due to no activity for a month.

I love Adventure Time and that show seems more like a teenage show to me. But now since parents are spoiling their children with expensive stuff, they're also letting their kids watch South Park and Family Guy O.o, it doesn't seem to matter anymore unless if the parents were smart and responsible (in my opinion). Well, I'm not gonna get into the whole topic of Disney because that conversation would last forever. Anyway, I would just hope that maybe a smart person in Show Business now a days would get their heads out of their butts and make something appropriate for kids.

Ticket stubs, receipts, the torn-off edges of notebook paper. Any doodles or scribbled ideas, and any note afforded her by a friend were kept and saved. Not everything received the honor, but particular things from specific events did. She wanted to keep track of each and every thing she had ever done. She did so, on a corkboard encircling her room from floor to ceiling; each day had its spot, and one could trace her life along the wall with the zigzagging strings of yarn that connected each day. She didn't often invite others into her room, for fear they might displace something, either by Reflections on the Metro The population of the Metro car is sparse at eleven in the morning; people talk. The mother with her baby and young son, talking to her friend or sister or cousin sitting down. The young man and woman speaking exuberant Chinese, a language like a song. The group of students in floral dresses and Converse that my mom says look European because of their scarves. They're rapidly spewing French in the way teenagers do, only I've only ever heard it in English. It's comfortable, each of us with our companions, more like a restaurant or a museum. But at five thirty, at L'Enfant Plaza, when people are going home from work in their button-downs and s Hide Show The Journal Portal 1000 points from Booboo = lieveheersbeestje Aug 27, 2013 229 comments It's almost Booboo'sbday and it's been along time since sheand I did a giveaway:bigthumb394131251:Rules:star:Fav this journal soI know that you'rein : ):star: Ichoose 10 winnerswith random.org (100points each):star:You don't have towatch me, but it'sappreciated if youlike my...
