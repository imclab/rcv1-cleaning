Related Star Wars Galaxy: See Full Coverage Below is the logo and two images from the upcoming animated series Star Wars Rebels , which is expected to premiere in fall 2014 as a one-hour special on Disney Channel and followed by a series on Disney XD. Executive Producer Dave Filoni says the look was inspired by original Star Wars concept artist Ralph McQuarrie. We wanted to create a look for this part of Star Wars that precedes A New Hope by just a little bit, Filoni said . We’re going for something that’s much more an illustrative look. The Clone Wars ran for five seasons on Cartoon Network until Disney bought Lucasfilm and pulled the plug on the series. Disney then announced plans for a new animated series  Rebels  for its own cable networks.  The Clone Wars was considered by many fans to be superior to the live-action prequel films that divided the shows fandom.
