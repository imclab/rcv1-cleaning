They have a variety of styles, combinations and prices. Be sure to use your car seat correctly and every time you get in the car. 1. Britax Roundabout Offers extended rear-facing to 30 lbs, a sculpted base allows less movement in the car, and the patented tether is good for forward and rear-facing positions. This seat is easy to use and install. 2. Evenflo Titan 5 5 point harness, 3 position recline, goes down to 5 lbs for smaller babies, and comes complete with tether and mesh bags for storage. 3.
