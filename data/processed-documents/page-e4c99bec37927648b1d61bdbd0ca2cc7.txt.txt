My name is William Kitchens, and I am the owner here at IDB Racing - Repair - Restoration. Ive been in the industry long enough to know that there are TONS of shops out there who are only out to make money, and dont actually care about customer service or fixing cars right. Not only am I extensively Bosch and ASE certified, Ive got multiple OEM certifications as well as countless hours of factory dealer training; in addition to spending years working at Dodge and Nissan dealerships Im thoroughly experienced with just about every make and model of European car ever produced. I use only the best parts and fluids, and where possible I use only OEM or OEM equivalent parts and materials. Our goal here at IDB Racing - Repair - Restoration is to fix YOUR car right the first time, all while saving you as much money and time as possible. We are able to offer insanely low pricing on EVERYTHING primarily because we are a relatively small shop with very low overhead - instead of marking prices up sky high, theyre usually just above (if not right at) our cost - ask anyone who weve performed work for, our prices are as fair and affordable as you can get, and our experience and attention to detail are second to none.We also offer second-to-none complete restoration services on classic European and import vehicles. Come by the shop anytime were open to check out some of our in-progress restorations, to observe our facility and work, or just to say hi!  1st Choice Automotive  8903 Westheimer Road Houston, TX 77063  (713) 782-5665 You have to count on your car.
