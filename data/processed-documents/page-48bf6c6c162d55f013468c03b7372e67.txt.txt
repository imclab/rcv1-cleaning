The first link below will take you to translations of many sutras. But understand that these are very complex texts. A different way to approach Buddhism is through books written by modern teachers. There are many good books of this type. An excellent example is Its Easier Than You Think by Sylvia Boorstein. This book will give you a brief and charming description of the basics of Buddhism. (Link below.) There are also many books that provide teaching from various Buddhist traditions. Two classics are Seeking the Heart of Wisdom by Jack Kornfield, Dalai Lama, and Joseph Goldstein (Vipassana tradition), and Zen Mind, Beginners Mind by Suzuki Roshi (Zen tradition). (Links below) Hope this helps.
