The story of the CS cars -- the C stands for Coupe and the S stands for Sport -- begins with the Baroque Angels and other cars of the '50s . C, CS and CSL coupe models: 2000CS 1990cc, four-cylinder,  135bhp, 0-60mph in 11.3 sec., 23 mpg 2.5CS 2494cc, six-cylinder, 150bhp,  0-60mph in 10 sec., 22 mpg 2800CS 2788cc, six-cylinder, 170bhp,  0-60mph in 8.5 sec., 19 mpg 3.0CS 2985cc, six-cylinder, 180bhp,  0-60mph in 8.0 sec., 18 mpg 3.0CSi 2985cc, six-cylinder, 200bhp,  0-60mph in 7.5 sec., 20 mpg 3.0CSL 3003cc, six-cylinder, 200bhp,  0-60mph in 7.2 sec., 17 mpg 3.0CSL Batmobile, 3153cc,  six-cylinder, 206bhp, 0-60mph in 6.8 sec., 22 mpg In 1962 the Italian designer Bertone was asked to produce a coupe version of the Goertz designed BMW 503 . The result was the BMW 3200CS, the last BMW powered by the 3.2-liter V8 first used in the BMW 502 Baroque Angel Sedan in 1954. Only 603 of the Bertone V8 CS coupes were produced. For the next generation, enter BMW Chief designer Wilhelm Hofmeister, the New Class and the Karmann coach builders. To create the 2000CS, BMW first modified the New Class 2-liter engine, put it in the Karmann CS coupe body and added some Hofmeister design touches. The engine modifications included twin two throat side draft carburetors. Like the New Class sedans, the 2000CS coupe had MacPherson strut front suspension with semi-trailing arms in the rear. The 1990cc four-cylinder engine produced 135bhp and could motor from 0-60mph in 11.3 seconds with a fuel rating of 23 mpg. These cars are instantly recognizable by their distinctive front-end, especially the headlights. The headlight treatment placed two sets of front lights and turn signals within a wrap-around glass enclosure. Advanced for its time, the design is similar to the front-end treatment on the E39 5 Series sedan and other contemporary BMW models. But the motoring press was critical of the design and after 11,720 C/CS cars were made (2837 2000C and 8883 2000CS) between 1965 and 1969, the 2000CS gave way to the BMW 2800CS (and the Europe-only 2.5CS), with a more conventional front-end treatment and a six-cylinder engine. The interior of the 2000CS was very luxurious. BMW ads at the time said the car handles like a Grand Prix champion yet feels like a long, silky limousine. This 'limousine' had a sleek console and steering wheel, lots of wood trim and leather or two-tone plush cloth seats. 2000CS Coupes Click for a larger image  Featured Sites BMW World's BMW 3.0CSL Batmobile page.
