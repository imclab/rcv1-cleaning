Deborah Copaken Kogan April 9, 2013 | This article appeared in the April 29, 2013 edition of The Nation. Tweet The authors 2002 book about her career as a war photographer was titled Shutterbabeagainst her wishes. Illustration by Milton Glaser Incorporated.  My latest novel was just long-listed  for Britains Womens Prize for Fiction, formerly known as the Orange Prize. I cried when I heard. Then I Googled it. Here are a few things I learned: it was founded in response to the 1991 Booker Prize, whose nominees were all men; it is frequently modified by the adjective prestigious; and it is controversial. Why do we need a separate prize for women, ask the columnists, year after year, in one form or another, following the announcement of the nominees. About the Author Deborah Copaken Kogan Deborah Copaken Kogan is a novelist whose most recent work, The Red Book (Hyperion), will be out in paperback on May 7.  Also by the Author Exchange: While We Wait for the Post-Patriarchy… Our Readers and Deborah Copaken Kogan The Orange Prize is a sexist con-trick posited a prize-winning male novelist in 2008 . The past is gone, he wrote. Get over it. The 2012 VIDA statistics have been out for some time now, so I wont linger over the current and quantifiable inequityyes, even in this magazinein the frequency with which male and female writers are reviewed today, five years after the past was deemed gone. Its a proven fact, backed by simple math even my first grader can understand: the number of reviews of books by men is greater than the number of reviews of books by women; the number of male reviewers is greater than the number of female reviewers. Men, in other words, are still the arbiters of taste, the cultural gatekeepers, and the recipients of what little attention still gets paid to books. What I will do, however, is open my kimono and make it personal, though Ive been warned not to do this. Its career suicide, colleagues tell me, to speak out against the literary establishment; theyll smear you. But never mind. Im too old and too invisible to said establishment to care. And I still believe, as Carol Hanisch wrote back in 1969 when I was having my then three-year-old feet forced into stiff Mary Janesthat the personal is political. So. Lets rewind and take a look at my so-called post-feminist life in arts and letters. Born in 1966, I came of age at the dawn of a revolution. The past was gone; we would move on and get over it! Except getting over it, as it turns out, takes more than an ashcan full of bras and access to the pill. It takes yearsdecades even. My whole life, in fact, and still counting. Nixon signed Title IX in 1972, when I was 6, but only the girls born many years after me got to reap its rewards. Who knows? Instead of a novelist, I might have become a really short, nebbishy soccer player. Fast-forward to 1988: I am raped by an acquaintance the night before my graduation from college. The next morning, before donning cap and gown, I stumble into the University Health Services building to report the crime. Im advised not to press charges. Theyll smear you, Im told by the female psychologist assigned to my case. I dont want to be smeared. Ive got a life to live. Twenty-five years later, while watching CNN lament the effects of the Steubenville rape on two promising livesthe rapists, not the victimsIll hold two competing thoughts: nothing has changed; I wish Id been braver. I decide to Google my rapists name, something Ive never done in the quarter-century since the crime. His promise, I note, has been duly fulfilled. Hes successful. Hes marriedto a woman who recently spoke on a Lean In panel with Sheryl Sandberg. Because lifes like that. Lets head on over to 1989. Im a 23-year-old war photographer, on the eve of my first professional exhibit at the inaugural Visa Pour lImage Perpignan photo festival . I share this honor with photojournalism heavyweights Sebastio Salgado and Jim Nachtwey. They and all the other menexcept the identical Turnley twins, who are paired for obvious reasonsare given solo exhibits. I share mine with another female on the slate that year, Alexandra Avakian. Ours is called Les Deux Femmes Sur le Front, which translates as The Two Women on the Front Lines. Of the twenty-six photographers featured in that first festival, we are the sole women. Its now 1998. I am the mother of two young children. I am my familys primary breadwinner, working full time as a producer at NBC. I have an Emmy, but its no big deal: work in TV news long enough, you eventually get one. Returning to work after my second maternity leave (which left my family broke, as it was unpaid), despite my specialty in international news I am assigned three stories in rapid succession: Putting Your Kids to Bed; Fussy Babies; Picky Eaters. I am one of the few mother-of-small-children producers on the show, but there are plenty of father-of-small-children producers in our ranks. I punt the Picky Eaters story and take a leave of absence to try my hand at my first passion, writing, which my (male) freshman expository writing professor had once dissuaded me from attempting, though Id previously been a young columnist for Seventeen . Its 1999. I sell my first book to Random House, a memoir of my years as a war photographer, for twice my NBC salary. Im thrilled when I hear this: a new job; self-reliance; the gift of time to do the work Ive been dreaming of since childhood. The book is sold on the basis of a proposal and a first chapter under the title Newswhore , which is the insult often lobbed at us both externally and from within our own ranksa way of noting, with a combination of shame and black humor, the vulture-like nature of our livelihood, and a means of reclaiming, as I see it, the word whore, since I want to write about sexual and gender politics as well. Random House changes the books title to Shutterbabe , which a friend came up with. I beg for Shuttergirl instead, to reclaim at least girl, as Lena Dunham would so expertly do years later. Or what about Develop Stop Fix ? Anything besides a title with the word babe in it. Please support our journalism. Get a digital subscription for just $9.50! Im told I have no say in the matter. The cover that the publisher designs has a naked cartoon torso against a pink background with a camera covering the genitalia. I tell them its usually my eye behind the camera, not my vagina. I fighthardto change the cover. Thankfully, I win this one, agreeing to shoot the cover photo myself, gratis. When my publicist tries to pitch the book to NPRs Terry Gross, a producer tells him that Terry likes the Shutter part of the title but not the babe part. Its now 2001. After two years of painstaking work to produce the bookhaving never written one before or attended grad school, I had to learn on the jobnearly every review refers to me as a stay-at-home mom. One such article is entitled Battlefield Barbie, which calls me a soccer-mom-in-training. I look nothing like Barbie. My kids dont play soccer. The general consensus is that the book is good, but I suck. The character assassinations are intense. Talk asks if Im worried Ill be labeled a slut. I object to both the word and the question; the journalist prints them anyway. Brills Content and The Womens Review of Books insinuate that I brought on my own rape and various other crimes that I experienced at the hands of menarmed robbery, a knockout blow to the skull from a crack addict. Salon resorts to slut-shaming and libel . New York thinks Im an insult to feminism for having left a promising career behind. My book is a bestseller, gets taught in journalism schools. I havent left anything behind, I think; Ive started something new. (Years later, the Internet, reality TV and citizen journalists with smartphones will decimate both of my former professions anyway, forcing many of my ex-colleagues to scramble both for work and for new ways of working.) A proponent of leaning in before it ever became a topic for panels with my rapists wife, I write to the publications who called me a slutty Barbie stay-at-home mom and/or an insult to feminism, not to ask for a public retraction, but to request privatelyprivately! I dont want to get smearedthat they carefully reconsider how theyre reviewing women. Would you call a male author a stay-at-home dad? I ask, among other rhetorical questions. The Barbie critic was at that time a freelancer, so his editor suggests I call him at home for his e-mail address, a relatively new thing at the time and not easily obtainable otherwise. A few weeks later, Im publicly shamed by this man at the National Book Critics Circle Award, where he has won the Balakian Citation. In his acceptance speech, though he stops short of naming me, he tells the story of the crazy woman writer who called him at home to complain about her review, though I was just calling for his e-mail address. Salon picks up the story and publishes both my full name and their own take, in which the critics amusing if false hearsay is printed as fact, without ever having called to ask me for a rebuttal. The name of the essay? When Authors Attack. (Theyll smear you, I think to myself.)Its now 2006. Ive just sold my first novel, Suicide Wood, a modern-day allegory of Dantes Inferno about a mother who kills herself and her children. Im told books with the word suicide in the title never sell and that I should keep my mouth shut about the Dante business: womenmy novels alleged audiencewill be turned off by Dante. And suicide. I explain that I would like women and men to read my novel, that its actually about suicide, and that an understanding of the Inferno is not a prerequisite for understanding it, just a bonus for Dante nerds. I remind everyone of the success of Jeff Eugenidess The Virgin Suicides. Its cover featured my friend Phyllidas blond hair, which is how I originally came to know of the book, but I would have picked it up anyway because, though female, Im drawn to novels about suicide. (I cant be the only one, can I?) His title has virgin in it, Im told. My title is changed to Between Here and April. Im not sure what this means, but Im told, once again, I have no say in the matter.Its 2009. I should be getting over it by now, and Im trying, I really am, but then my third book, Hell Is Other Parents, a collection of personal essays, is published with a pink cover and placed in the parenting section. Prior to publication, I try changing the color to robins egg blue, the classification to memoir, and the title to Screwing in the Marital Bed, the title of one of the essays, which I think better encapsulates the thrust of the book. I am told, for the third time, that I have no say in the matter.Its now 2012. My fourth book, The Red Book, future nominee for the prestigious yet controversial Womens Prize for Fiction and New York Times bestseller, gets passed over for a review in The New York Times Book Review, just like its predecessors. One morning, I hit a few independent bookstores to sign stock. Our publishers urge us to do so during a books first weeks. Was it reviewed in the Times? one bookseller asks me, searching his computer for any sign of the novel, which he was unable to locate on the shelves. I tell him no. Then we probably dont stock it. I hear the same story from three more booksellers before heading home with my pristine Sharpie.I consider throwing in the towel. The lack of respectful coverage, the slut-shaming and name-calling, all the girly book covers and not-my-titles despite high literary aspirations, has worn me down, made me question everything: my abilities, my future, my life. This is what sexism does best: it makes you feel crazy for desiring parity and hopeless about ever achieving it. A few months later, after delivering a lecture on the media-invented mommy wars at the Sun Valley Writers Conference, a song pops up on my iPhone as Im walking back to my hotel room: Bob Dylans Like a Rolling Stone. When you aint got nothing, Dylan sings, you got nothing to lose.Yes, I think. Yes.I suppress the three words that have haunted me my entire adult lifeTheyll smear youand choose Dylans instead, composing a carefully worded private e-mail to the editor of The New York Times Book Review, alerting him to his neglect of all four of my published books. He responds graciously with two sentences in which he promises to share this information with his colleagues. Eight months later, the novel remains unreviewed.Its 2013, the day I sit down, with trepidation, to write this. The Timess obituary for Yvonne Brill, renowned rocket scientist, winner of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, leads with, She made a mean beef stroganoff, followed her husband from job to job and took eight years off from work to raise three children. The worlds best mom, her son Matthew said.The past is not gone. Or as Faulkner wrote, The past is never dead. Its not even past. Until it is, we should not be expected to get over it.Im proud of my nomination for a prestigious if controversial British literary prize given only to women. Im honored to be mentioned in the same breath as my fellow nominees, whose books Ive been tearing through of late with relish and awe. Past winnersHelen Dunmore, Anne Michaels, Carol Shields, Suzanne Berne, Linda Grant, Kate Grenville, Ann Patchett, Valerie Martin, Andrea Levy, Lionel Shriver, Zadie Smith, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Rose Tremain, Marilynne Robinson, Barbara Kingsolver, Ta Obreht and Madeline Millerinclude authors whose novels I know well or not at all, but it is for the latter, as a reader, I am most grateful.The Womens Prize for Fictionand three cheers for the transparency of its new nameis not a sexist con-trick by any definition of sexism that I know. To the contrary, it redresses centuries of literary sexism, exclusion, cultural bias, invisibility. Theres a reason J.K. Rowlings publishers demanded that she use initials instead of Joanne: its the same reason Mary Anne Evans used the pen name George Eliot; the same reason Robert Southey, then Englands poet laureate, wrote to Charlotte Bront: Literature cannot be the business of a womans life, and it ought not to be. In fact, Im thinking about starting a womens prize here in the United States, to be given out once a year, every year, until gender parity in the arts is achieved.I figure that should take me from now until my obituary.Mad Mens Peggy Olson is onto something Sheryl Sandberg hasnt realized, says Michelle Dean.
