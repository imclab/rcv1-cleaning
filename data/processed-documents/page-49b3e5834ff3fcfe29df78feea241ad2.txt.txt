When your package arrives open and inspect every part for damage. If anything is broken save all of your packing material and the broken pieces. It is also important that you call us on the day you received the shipment so we can contact the shipper with a claim. If it is after hours or no one answers the phone, leave a message with your name, number and a list of what needs to be replaced. We have very few breakage occupancies, but when shipping glass anything can happen. If you call us the day your shipment arrives we will deal with the shipping company and replace all of your broken product as quickly as possible. All orders are custom cut on a first come basis except breakage. Replacement of broken parts always goes to the top of the cutting list because you have already patiently waited your turn. Glass Colors During the ordering process, please indicate your choice of color for each piece of auto glass in the Kit. You may choose clear glass or one of the following tints: 70% green, 52% light smoked, 52% light bronze. In most states the legal windshield replacement color is clear or light green tint. Call your local Highway Patrol and ask them what is legal for the road in your state. How to Order the Correct Glass Kit Since flat vintage auto glass and vintage truck glass is custom cut to order, it is imperative that you check several pieces of information to ensure that you order the correct Glass Kit to fit your vehicle. Optimally you should check the Style/Model Number of your vehicle. Below you will find the description of the exact Make and Models this Glass Kit will fit. The Style/Model Number defines the body style of your auto and without it you take the chance of buying the wrong glass. Occasionally multiple body styles were produced for the same Make in a given year, each with different window sizes and shapes. If you can not find your Style/Model Number please send me an email or call (530) 626-6923 M-F 8-5 Pacific Time and we will be happy to help determine the correct set of glass for you. Please leave a detailed message that contains what the Year, Make, Body Style, 2 or 4 Door and Style No. of the car or truck you need glass for. The Style/Model Number of your vehicle can be found on the fire wall under the hood, in the glove box or on the drivers door. Do not mistake your VIN number for the Style/Model Number ; the Style/Model Number begins with the two-digit year of the vehicle. This number is followed by a hyphen and the number and/or letter combination that corresponds to the body style. For example the Model Number for one of the 1935 Chevy 2 Door coupe's is "35-1017." If your car is unmodified the model number will allow us to determine exactly which glass patterns to use in order to ensure a perfect original factory fit for your glass. If your Model Number is not listed below, this is not the correct glass kit for your vehicle . Return to our Yahoo Store to search other glass kits of the correct year and check to make sure the kit lists your Model Number before purchasing it. Flat Glass Processing Time We custom cut every flat antique auto glass and antique truck glass order on a first-come first-served basis. It can take 15 to 20 business days from the time of your order to the shipment of your glass. Make sure you provide us with your phone number, contact information and a street address so we can contact you to ensure the proper kit was purchased.
