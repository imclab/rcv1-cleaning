Home  Events  Portlands Foghorn Stringband Brings Back Old-Time Music at The ArtsCenter on March 28th! by: Tri AE  Foghorn Stringband Foghorn Stringband will bring their celebrated old-time and Louisiana French string band revival music from Oregon to The ArtsCenter on Thursday, March 28th at 7:00pm . Only 100 tickets will be sold for the show. Tickets are $15 in advance for the general public, $11 in advance for Friends of The ArtsCenter , and $19 Day-of-Show. The ArtsCenter is located at 300-G E. Main St. in Carrboro . Visit http://artscenterlive.org/event/performance/1623 for tickets and directions. Portland’s Foghorn Stringband stands at the top of today’s vibrant old-time music revival and exemplify what an unending revival it is. Each album finds them deeper into the tradition, more familiar with the rich resources of roots music, and more focused, but still propelled by that undercurrent of punk energy, says Art Menius, Executive Directorof the ArtsCenter . Foghorn fits perfectly with our on going exploration of roots music in the hands of todays young masters. The string band revival began in Chapel Hill some 45 years ago. Now Portland is its hub thanks to Foghorn. Foghorn Stringband is the shining gold standard for American stringband music, with seven albums, thousands of shows, over a decade of touring under their belts, and two entirely new generations of old-time musicians following their lead. Through all this, they’ve never let the music grow cold; instead they’ve been steadily proving that American roots music is a never-ending well of inspiration. From their origins in Portland, Oregon’s underground roots music scene, the core duo of Foghorn Stringband, Caleb Klauder, whose wistful, keening vocals and rapid-fire mandolin picking have always been the heart of the band, and Stephen ‘Sammy’ Lind, perhaps the best old-time fiddler of his generation, have spread the old-time stringband gospel all over the world, but they’ve also brought in new influences and inspirations from their many travels and fellow bandmates. Foghorn Stringband play the old way, the way you’d have heard stringbands play on Southern radio stations back in the 1930s. They don’t fancy up the music to make it more modern, instead they reach into the heart of the songs, pulling out the deep emotions that made them so enduring in the first place. Performing live, these multi-instrumentalists gather around a single microphone in the middle of the stage, expertly balancing their sound on the fly, and creating the rarest of music: songs that are at once wildly virtuosic and intimately hand-crafted. Foghorn Stringband play American roots music of the finest order. Programs at The ArtsCenter are supported in part by Brooks Pierce, Chapel Hill Restaurant Group, Giorgios Hospitality Group, The North Carolina Arts Council, The Orange County Arts Commission, and Tony Hall and Associates.
