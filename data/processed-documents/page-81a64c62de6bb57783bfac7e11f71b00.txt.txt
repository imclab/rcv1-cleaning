Sharing stunning videos with millions of re-post has become daily news feed on your Facebook wall. Arts and Entertainment events on Broadway are just starting to realize the new format to market for " word of mouth ". BroadwayGlobal is giving you a chance to go viral so read carefully. Broadway, TV Movies and even you, we all must accept that viral Social Media post and re-post links are the new way to get the word out. Even this article offers share buttons for Facebook and Twitter, because a re-post could bring hit numbers up to thousands, millions or billions, which share the message of keeping arts alive, just like a current off Broadway play that mirrors Russia's human rights issues . With millions of shared shocking pictures, videos, and secret stories shared every second on Instagram , Twitter, Facebook , we have also been educated quickly. Not everything we read or see on the wild-web is what it seams! Many times a wild-web post has been photo shopped, or edited to capture your attention. They are hoping that your re-post or re-share on Social Media will bring attention to their brand and marketing ploy. It's not a bad thing. It made you smile. That captivating shocking picture or secret video that you shared on your Facebook wall worked. Remember doing that? What made you do it? Now use that knowledge for your own brand, to market to your target audience. When Lady Gaga posted herself without make-up, that one personal photo share was re-posted with breaking numbers. A clever post or re-post on Social Media is cost effective. The effect of one viral post cannot be matched, not even with unaffordable cost of a front page ad in the newspaper, or a commercial on a network TV. BroadwayGlobal shares your chance to go viral below, so keep reading. Marketing that exposes shocking, sexy, secrets, wedding proposals, falls, fights, political issues, police car chase... they all have become the norm to get your attention. Have you ever noticed driving your car, that commercial that beeps, that car horn sound, or police siren? It got your attention! Did it not? Let's face it, readers fall for the headline first, then the Social Media viral picture, or video. If they can capture you enough to re-post it, they did their job! When you see a movie star arrested, with hair messed up and looking like death mourned over, you want to re-post or share it don't you? Our society relishes in failure, so when a theatre critic post a review like " Five Guys Named Moe" as "Five Guys and One Moeisha" it captures your attention. You might even re-post the viral headline, picture or video because it made you laugh. Why? Because we want to share that laugh, cry, experience with friends who get our humor, or who respect our opinion. What gets your attention when it comes to Broadway? Will pictures of Tony Award winning Andre DeShields ( The Wiz , The Full Monty, Ain't Misbehavin ', The Jungle Book ) past and present photos that are included in our slide show? Maybe, Broadway stars pictured in " Then and Now " or Broadway secrets of canned vocal hitting that eight times a week high note? The Broadway casting company that cast the show before the auditions.. Do Broadway casting companies have to much power on final stars? The behind the scenes, back stage exclusive on "War Horse" , stories that are true and simple catch the attention of Broadway arts lovers, who want that inside look. Many Broadway stars also understand the importance of fans with Facebook or Twitter fan accounts, groups or pages that help promote that next show, concert or TV project. You Tube accounts like Theatre Chat's www.youtube.com/TheaterChat help share the easy and free way to post auditions or show information that patrons support. "The You Tube account of a brother getting his finger bit by little baby sister, sitting in the car seat, or the teacher who showed his personality on stage through the evolution of dance are great video examples that millions and billions of fans were captured. That audience can comment, post, re-post with record breaking hits and numbers that can promote your next project." Theatre Chat . PSY Gangnum Style record breaking You Tube hits, or the Harlem Shake videos could promote your next project. Think it out like a marketing firm, a company that gets paid to capture your target market audience by age, sex or gender. You can also capture your audience. Our Broadway breaking news articles that include Cindi Lauper's " Kinky Boots " , new Broadway cast recording of "Pippin" , Idina Menzel and Taye Diggs viral forgetful lyrical moment, BroadwayGlobal's top pick Broadway Musicals and many more.

With a clever take or idea, you can also capture an audience even when the subject matter it not easy to discuss in public. Social Media makes it less abrasive and easily assessable.
