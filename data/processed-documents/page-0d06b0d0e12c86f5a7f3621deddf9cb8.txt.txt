As for Stephen Baldwin, his face looks frozen in time, probably thanks to all the plastic surgery  botox injections. Im pretty sure Hailey caught the eye of a couple members of One Doucherection. The One Direction: This Is Us premiere was held last night at the Ziegfeld Theater. I just cant believe they made this film in 3D! Damn you, Simon Cowell!!

These two are always having the time of their lives when theyre together, so its a pity theyre gonna take the suicide plunge by getting married. For those of you looking to hit up the US Open, Im sure a lot of celebs will be in attendance later today to catch tennis big-dogs Roger Federer  Novak Djokovic play their opening games . Federer will play in the afternoon  #1 ranked Djokovic will play under the lights later this evening.

Tuesday, August 27, 2013 while eating a Bastardly Certified lunch by Moe 0 Photo Credit: INF Photo View All Photos  This latest photo was snapped yesterday as a mystery woman was seen cruising around L.A. inside Lamars Mercedes-Benz G500 SUV. Since this woman isnt that hot, so were gonna give Lamar the benefit of the doubt  assume she isnt the woman hes been banging on the side. When Evil Kris Jenner sold the story to TMZ about why her daughter is separating from husband Lamar Odom, she referenced a Lamars secret drug problem and also revealed details that the dude has been missing for 72 hoursapparently on a secret cocaine binge with his druggy friends. Since that story was leaked (i.e. sold by to TMZ by Kris Jenner), Lamar Odoms agent Jeff Schwartz refuted the claims by telling ESPN.com on Monday that, “Lamar is not missing. His wife knows exactly where he is. Playing in the NBA is still very much a part of Lamar’s plans.” (via SI Wire ) What the hell was Lamar Odom thinking when shacking up with the Kardashian family ? I hope he does a tell-all interview revealing all the bullshit he suffered through over the past few years. Also, seeing how shit finally hit the fan for Lamar, I hope Kanye is keeping a close eye on all the drama b/c for all we know, hes next. Its only a matter of time until Kris Jenner lands a kill shot on Kanye . Sure, itll result in an epic album where Kanye will lyrically shit on the Kardashian family, but its gonna be a long  painful road moving forward.

Previous Next Closed Circuit: FilmReview Tuesday, August 27, 2013 while thinking about eating a Bastardly Certified lunch by abba 0 Photo Credit: Focus Features Visit the films official website! A terrorist blows up London. A government trial that will surely end in conviction begins. The defendant will be tried with secret evidence that he cannot see. And then, just before the trial is set to start, his attorney dies. The legal system in today’s international police state is at the focus of this clumsy new thriller from director John Crowley. Clearly, the movie has ambitious aims; unfortunately, it kind of shrugs its shoulders at itself after the first hour when it decides it would rather be about competing attorneys who happen to be ex-lovers than a taut examination of complex legal issues in the modern world. Eric Bana gives what can only be termed a serviceable performance – I say serviceable because the material he’s given doesn’t ask him to do anything more than brood into the camera and then exchange knowing looks with the movie’s real star, Rebecca Hall. She has slightly more to do in the movie than you might expect, but even her role as a special counsel is subverted to her romantic entanglement with Bana’s character. The movie is billed as a thriller, but it forgets to include enough thrills to qualify. Meh.

Rocsi Diaz was on location doing interviews for Entertainment Tonight but also worked the red carpet for a few photos too. As you know, basically the film is a 3D concert for the group, assumingly similar to what weve seen before from Justin Bieber and Jonas Brothers. Anyways, were sure teenage girls around the world are waiting in anticipation for the films opening on August 29th in the UK, a day later in the US. Visit One Direction: This Is Us for more information. Billed as an intimate all-access look at life on the road for the global music phenomenon, This Is Us will follow the lives of the five members of the boy band, One Direction: Louis, Zayn, Liam, Harry and Niall. Containing live concert footage from Londons O2 Arena,[2] the film will contain footage from their lives pre- and post-X Factor appearance and give an insight to their fans into the preparation for their concerts and ultimately what it is like to be One Direction.[3][4] The film will also provide the premiere of the song Best Song Ever from their upcoming album Where We Are.
