Here is the actor, alone on the stage, telling tales, confiding secrets, sharing laughter or tears with the audience...One actor does it all. She can become whoever she chooses, hiding her thoughts and feelings from the audience, fooling them into believing her tears, her laughter, perhaps her lies as well.These fifty original monologs were created to give the actor multiple ways to conceal or reveal herself. Ive aimed to provide a range of age-appropriate pieces suited for audition, for performance, for class work or for study.Several of the monologs in this collection have won awards. Others are so new that you may be the very first to work on them.A monolog is an opportunity.The actor makes it happen.Break a leg!Jolene Goldenthal Item# 8706 128 pgs., softcover, 9-780978-908706 $11.99 Order Quantity: Check for giftwrap ($1.50) CD Cover Cassette Cover Fascinating Walt Disney By Stephen Schochet (Author/Narrator) HE WAS TOLD MICKEY WOULD NEVER WORK-A GIANT MOUSE ON THE SCREEN WOULD TERRIFY WOMEN!
