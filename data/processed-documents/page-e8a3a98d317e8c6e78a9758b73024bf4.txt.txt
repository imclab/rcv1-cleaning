The Ciel’s doors are hinged at the rear to reveal a sweeping view of the dramatic interior, accented with nickel-plated trim, exquisite Italian Olive wood and soft leather. Cadillac’s heritage of advanced technology is evident everywhere you look, beginning with the Ciel’s bold LED headlamps and tail lights.  THE ELEGANCE IN THE DETAILS Simplicity, authenticity and spaciousness were the guiding principles when it came to developing the interior. Seats wrapped in glove-soft leather feature sloping bolsters that allow passengers to slide into them more comfortably. But perhaps the defining element is the incorporation of Italian Olive wood trim throughout. This special wood is a premium yet sustainable material, and in the Ciel came from a single, fallen tree, painstakingly prepared and specially cut.  LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY IN THE CADILLAC TRADITION Advanced technology highlights the Ciel interior. Transparent gauges are framed within a brushed-aluminum housing that has the intricate depth of a high-quality chronograph. A “floating” center console that runs from the front to the back features hidden connectivity portals for each passenger, allowing each to make dinner reservations, check the weather, or even upload photos of the journey via social media. Additional technology includes inductive charging and Bluetooth® connectivity. The final touches? Heated and cooled seats, a drawer containing sun lotion, sun glasses and towels, and aromatherapy that is controlled from the rear armrest.
