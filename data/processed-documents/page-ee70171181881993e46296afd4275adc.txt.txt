 ITALY: Suzuki unveils redesigned SX4 crossover By Chris Wright | 28 June 2013 Suzuki is launching its redesigned SX4 - its predecessor was developed and built jointly with Fiat - but the name might not stick in Europe because the new model is vastly different from the outgoing one. In Europe, it will be badged as the SX4 S-Cross, and it is thought the SX4 tag will be eventually dropped altogether. The new crossover, unveiled at the Geneva show earlier this year, is notably bigger than its predecessor, particularly in the rear where passengers get 44mm more leg room and an additional 39mm for their knees. There is also more cargo space. The S-Cross is built at Magyar Suzuki in Hungary and Dale Wyatt, sales and marketing chief at the companys UK operation said: We needed something bigger to be able to respond to customer expectations with regard to crossovers in Europe and it gives us a presence in an important and growing market area. This crossover segment was pioneered by the Nissan Qashqai launched in 2007. In Nissan's range it replaced the mundane Almera C-segment hatchback and and MPV derivative and remains the best-selling C-segment crossover in Europe. Wyatt described the S-Cross as a trigger model helping to boost Suzuki sales along with other new models coming through over the next three years including a new Alto, a B-segment SUV and a small family car. Prices are expected to be around 10% lower than competitors and the car will give Suzuki a genuine fleet model and access to the family market and help the brand move away from its image as solely a small car maker. Wyatt added: The crossover segment has become important as customers are looking for the versatility of an MPV but want looks less boxy than something like a people carrier. If you rate your proposed purchase on a matrix, the SX4 really does tick all the boxes on space, performance, price emissions and safety. "We are confident of getting a 5-star NCAP [crash test] rating which is better than the outgoing model. This car will appeal to families, particularly to those coming out of mid-size or small hatchbacks as well as C segment cars and SUVs.
