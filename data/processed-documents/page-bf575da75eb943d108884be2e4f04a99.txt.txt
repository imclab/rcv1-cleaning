 90 Fair  Arts  Entertainment  Home  Arts  Entertainment Arts  Entertainment District Overview Downtown Longmont is infused with arts, entertainment and culture  allowing visitors to turn everyday life into a memorable experience. A purchase is more than a monetary transaction, a walk is more than a commute and a meal is more than just an every day occurrence. Downtown Longmont is filled with inspiring architecture, interactive retail stores, eclectic dining and great art venues. It mixes historic charm and character with modern style and convenience. Downtown Longmont is the hub for enjoying, creating and learning about whatever artistic medium moves you! Two community theaters, five stores that offer music lessons, countless workshops and hands-on sessions at our galleries as well as interactive retail stores, allowing locals and visitors to learn or create their own masterpiece! If your idea of creativity is ordering a great dinner/drink combination before you hear live music or theater, than Downtown Longmont is also the place for you! With more than 20 restaurants and a growing calendar of events  being a patron is always an exciting way to spend your time! The community of Longmont recently designated Downtown Longmont as its new Arts and Entertainment District . It is well on its way to reaching that collective vision.
