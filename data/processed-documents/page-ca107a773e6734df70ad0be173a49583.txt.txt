Heres what the critics are saying: So really, what is there to say? You know what you’re going to get, and that is, indeed, what Sandler delivers. It’s juvenile, it’s obvious and it’s crass. But with Sandler at the helm, at least it’s as easy to like as it is to forget. —  Elizabeth Weitzman, New York Daily News Mystifyingly, the movie manages to emerge plot-free. Instead, it offers a succession of humorless gross-out gags, fat jokes, suggestive posturing, bullying, belches and pratfalls. —  Claudia Puig, USA Today The best that can be said for this who-asked-for-it sequel to the 2010 comedy is that Rob Schneider did not return. As for the rest of the cast - led by Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock and David Spade - they are comedically outgunned by an inflatable raft that literally pops up in two scenes. —  Alonso Duralde, Chicago Tribune Progressing from one lazy scene to the next, the heroes contend with the tropes of wedding anniversaries, teenage daughters and overbearing mothers. But mostly they replicate gags that made them famous to begin with. —  Jacob Axelrad, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Do you plan on seeing this movie?
