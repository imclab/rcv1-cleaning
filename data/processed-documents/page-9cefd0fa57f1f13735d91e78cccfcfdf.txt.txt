And that has freed up some space on the main show floor for Chinese automakers BYD and Brilliance to move up from the basement, where they were last year , and into the prime real estate. With plans to sell cars in the US eventually, Chinas Brilliance Automotive will bring two sedans, a sports coupe and a hatchback to Detroit this year. These cars likely would not meet our current safety and emissions standards, so dont expect to see these specific models on sale in the US anytime soon. But they do show the direction and breadth of product the automaker has in China. The most interesting of the bunch to our eyes in terms of styling, is the Sport Sedan. This car shares a platform with the companys Luxury Sedan, which was designed by famed Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro and is about the same size as a Hyundai Sonata. Under the hood of every one of Brilliances cars (except the normally aspirated Hatchback) is a 1.8-liter turbocharged four cylinder producing roughly 168 hp and paired to a five-speed manual or automatic transmission. Not surprisingly, the Luxury Sedan features the most equipment, and that includes heated leather seats, a chilled beverage cooler and even a 6.5-inch LCD monitor and six disc DVD player. Just when exactly Chinese cars will make their way to the US, and how exactly these cars will sold are open questions.
