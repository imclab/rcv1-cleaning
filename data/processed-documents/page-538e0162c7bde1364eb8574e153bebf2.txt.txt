 Welcome to SoCal Car Culture ! THE place to find out what is happening in Southern California's Car Culture. This site evolved from my lifelong passion for anything automotive. I have loved cars and anything related to them for as long as I can remember. For the past few years I have been shooting Car Shows and Cruise Nights and sharing the photos online. People I talk to at these events frequently ask me when and where the next show is so I decided to create this online resource for that info and more. Your information and feedback will make this the most comprehensive resource online for: E-mail C Copyright  2002-2013 SoCalCarCulture.com and Copyright  2002-2013 Dave Lindsay All Rights Reserved  I shoot as many events as I can and share those images with all of you, take a look at the listings and if you know of an event coming up that is not shown please let me know about it.
