THANK YOU to the more than 300 Arts and Entertainment organizations and venues who are teaming with us to share information about incredible offerings of concerts, museums, festivals, recreation, historic sites, performances, classes, tours and ... just plain ole FUN. Their work invigorates, educates, inspires and entertains hundreds of thousands of residents of and visitors to Middle Tennessee. THANK YOU to the entire Community Foundation Staff. Together they have solidified their much deserved reputation as one of the very best teams for creative thinking and inspired implementation in the non-profit sector. A special thank you to Denise Alper whose tireless research and work helped us to discern what might best serve our community. And who then - with grace, goodwill and gumption - shouldered the task of making it happen. We are grateful to Jennifer Schwartzenberg, our Project Director, for her energy, passion and hard work! To paraphrase the great songwriter, Bob DiPiero, she's not from the south, but she got here as fast as she could!
