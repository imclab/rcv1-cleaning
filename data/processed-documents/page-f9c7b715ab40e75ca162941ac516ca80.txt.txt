Certified pre-owned cars have undergone rigid inspections and been refurbished by their manufacturer.  Also enticing is that they are backed with an extended auto warranty .  Automakers are realizing that they can’t ignore the certified vehicle market. A recent study shows that certified pre-owned car sales have gone up 46% since the year 2000.  It is estimated that 1.5 million certified used vehicles are sold yearly, which is equivalent to approximately 10 % of the sales of new cars. So what are the best and worst certified pre-owned cars to purchase?  Forbes.com has put out a list to help consumers make a good purchase. At the top of the list of the best CPO cars are Honda Accord and Toyota 4Runner.  Following is the Acura TL, and Subaru Impreza.  Also, the Lexus GS tops the list. Cars on the worst list are the Saturn Relay, and Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Also, the Volkswagen New Beetle, Pontiac G6, and Mercedes Benz E Class make the list. Certified pre-owned can be a great way to purchase an updated vehicle without the updated cost.  Another perk is that they come with an extended auto warranty .  Just remember to keep in mind the best and worst CPO car lists when considering a purchase.
