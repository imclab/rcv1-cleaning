There is no need to fill in Division and Class numbers, as entries are processed from the actual exhibit tags after the show is judged.  For Standard Flower Show, Camellia Show and Dahlia Show online registration click here . Fine Art images must be submitted separately by email after online registration is complete. There is no way to attach them during the online entry process. Please make sure the images are labeled or identified in the body of the email.
