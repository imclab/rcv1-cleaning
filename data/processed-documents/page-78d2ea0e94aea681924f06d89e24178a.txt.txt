Hi guys, have a question, what would be the best shocks for running ( seriously ) at Auto Cross? We had a problem with our tires over heating on one side, and was told by some of the pros that if we had adjustable shocks we could adjust dampening on one side and even the car out so we do not over heat the tires on one side or front and back.. Any help would be appreciated ( currently we have pss9's on the car... ) Share Share this post on Digg Del.icio.us Technorati Twitter Facebook! __________________ eXperimental Vehicle = TPC turbo - car wide LED lighting - Magden computer - Traqmate - DNX9140 and more - all self installed.

FYI it's damping. Dampening is what happens at speed with poorly setup adjustable shocks. Seriously though, there are a lot of great adjustable race dampers out there. Your need and desired tunability would have to narrow down what the best is. As an off the cuff suggestion in my experience Penske, Moton, and Sachs all make great 3 and 4 way adjustable units.

To address the overheating issue, what are your alignment specs? What tires are you running? Have you put a pyrometer across the contact patch? What are you running for pressures hot/cold? Are you shaving the tires or running full tread depth? How many heat cycles do you have on them? These are all much bigger factors in overheating tires than running an adjustable coilover.

Bridgestone Re-11 's on HRE Comp 21 wheels, pss9's, HR sway bars, strut brace in front and roll bar attached to struts in the rear adding stability as well. No I have not tried a pyro yet, next time I will It was in the 80's and on the 8th or so run the tires on the left side taking the most abuse was Really hot compared to the other side. We did 8 runs in about an hour and half period ( 2 drivers in same run group ). we where running 39 front and 40 rear, but once the driver side heated up they where at 46 - 48 while the other side was fine. not sure of exact spec for alignment ( am at work ), I do know it is camber in on front and back and very little two out in the front. The tires are new , not shaved with about 300 miles on them with 3 days of Auto X. The pss9's don't really do very much as far as damping goes. 9 clicks is about the same as one lick on a moton from what I have been told.

Frankin', You need to understand that you are running street tires, not race tires. Eight AX runs on a full tread depth street tire on an 80 degree day is going to get them pretty darn hot, and maybe greasy. Keep in mind too that pressure will increase with temperature. If you hang with top level SCCA AX guys, you will see some of them spraying their tires between runs. To add to that, if you or your co-driver are new at this, its better than even money that somewhere along the line the tires are being overdriven. No amount of money or set-up is going to solve that. Being a street tire, I am not sure that Bridgestone publishes what they think is the optimum temperature for maximum grip (I have not looked). That would be useful information to have, assuming a pyrometer and some skid pad time are brought in to the discussion. Brian Edit: As for the question about best shocks, the real top dog SCCA National Champ types (I'm talkin' the Mark Daddio's of the world) will likely run a custom valve, multi-adjustable set up, designed specifically for the car in question. Speed costs money. How fast do you want to go? :-) Share Share this post on Digg Del.icio.us Technorati Twitter Facebook!

At the PCA club race at Road Atlanta this spring, I was speaking with one of the Michelin engineers about street tire pressure for DEs and AutoX. He had a very simple answer - 35#s hot, unless you find some obvious reason that would make you think otherwise (chunking, minor handling tweaks, etc.). He said he felt it would be the same for Michelin, Bridgestone, what ever, given the general construction of street tires. He was also not in favor of a lot of camber for street tires. That said, I have moved my hot pressures on the Brigestone 050s from 39/40, down to 38/39, and now, I run about 35F/36R for DEs and AutoX. AutoX times are very competitve in comparison to all cars that I look at - All Caymans, all Boxters, 996s, and 997s, including GT3s and Turbos, all stock and prepared within our PCA classes. Try the lower pressures - I think you will find the car much happier. I going to go to PS2s when the Bridgestones finally give it up - but after 3 DEs at Road Atlanta, probably a dozen AutoXs and 12,000 miles, they are still in good shape. No chunking, no feathering, and still well above the wear bars. I do have maximum factory front camber settings.

Trackday: The first run the tires are cold, but after that they can get too hot. An autocross lasts ~1 minute, but you do more turning than you will do in a few laps on a road course, and the turning is harder. It is the turning that heats up a tire, and without big straights between these hard turns the heat doesn't have time to dissipate and so it just builds. Frankin: It is a pretty wild guess to pin it on shocks. It has to do with course design, tire design, driving surface, driving style, ambient temp, camber, time between runs, and air pressure. Do you spin out alot? That will heat up tires in a hurry. The SCCA requires 5 minutes between runs on a car. You should start with your tires near max pressure as a first estimate for best traction. Monitor air pressure between runs and adjust to keep it right (as the tire heats up the pressure goes up). As far as alignment, that will help if the outside edge gets much hotter than the inside edge- you need a pyrometer and skid pad testing to find the right camber. Get a water sprayer and cool them off between runs if necessary.

Frankin, The best start to improve your handling would be a set of our adjustable sway bars. Especially in autocross, the sway bars control how the vehicle shifts its weight side to side. In autocross where there are many very fast transitions, this increased control over body roll will give you a greater tire contact patch during hard cornering. While the HR bars may make a difference during light driving, when pushed to their limits we find that they aren't quite correct for the application. If you upgrade the sway bars and still find you need more grip, then it is time to start looking at a serious set of coilovers. When you get to that step, I would recommend a set of JRZ RS Pro shocks. Give us a call and we can work out exactly what it will take to get the desired handling performance out of your cayman.

Part of the answer depends on the competion class where you desire to run  be competitive. Certain organizations do not allow adjustable dampers, coil overs, etc. without a significant bump up in class. For you, with the Turbo, you are probably already in the stratosphere on points/class level so it probably does not much matter, but for others is will.

Forget upgrading your shocks for now. You are tire/grip limited. 46-48 PSI is *WAY* too high for these tires. Adjust your pressures after EVERY run to bleed off the pressure. And get a competition alignment to put as much negative camber into the front as it will give without modifying the suspension mounting points. You can also sprintz some water on the tires to help cool them off between runs. A garden sprayer tank with a pump handle works great. With only 300 miles on the tires, your tread depth is large enough that the tread blocks are moving around a LOT, and that generates heat. Be sure that you are not over-driving the slow parts of the course and seriously understeering (pushing). You'll know if this is happening because your tires will be howling and the car won't turn as much as the steering input you have given. This is a very common mistake for newer autocrossers - trying to go too fast where one must be slow. If your problem was mostly on the front left, then you may have been overdriving one or more slow right-hand turns (or vice-versa). As your driving skills increase, spend money on good autocross tires before getting into expensive shocks. That will give you far more bang for the buck. The stock Cayman suspension is really quite good. The best upgrade order for newer autocrossers is: 1. Read books on autocrossing and take a school (work on the nut behind the wheel first!) 2. Alignment 3. Tires 4. Depends on what group you run with and where you want the car classed...

I'm not an auto-cross expert (my background is mainly in road-racing), but I agree that it sounds like your tire pressures are too high. Next, as above, I would stress the importance of a competition alignment. As for tire temp, in road racing we are always working to get temp into the tires before a stint (warmers if allowed). From my experience, the tires cool pretty quickly, and so I am skeptical of spraying them with water ('course I don't know anything about the super-soft compounds the autocross pros must run). With the PSS9s, and other mods you already have, you already have a quite tune-able car. I would avoid spending more money on parts for awhile. Even on high-end racing cars, you perhaps wouldn't believe the debates about how and what should be tuned - and the surprising results. Best of luck.

If I ran 35 pounds hot my PS2s would last exactly one DE. They would cord the outside shoulders. That is on a stock alignment. Stock everything. Maybe if I were aligned to present a nice face to the tarmac it would be a different story. But for the guy going out for a DE in his stock car, chasing 35 pounds will shred your tires based upon my experience. Good for Michelin business, I guess. The more I learn, the more it is apparent that everything works together as a system...and that it depends is often the only answer that is correct.

Dave, As noted, I was working my way down to those pressures over the last year anyway, as I had the same concern. In any case, no question 35#s was the word from the Michelin engineer. Maybe if you are cording, you are over driving the tires but of course as I noted, there are always reasons to adjust from the general rule given your own circumstances. On my old Dinan 330ci, I gave up on street tires for DEs, and went to RA1s as I would chunk and cup everything I tried on the front (given he understeer in the BMWs, even with 235s all around, I cupped the RA1s on the front too, but no chunking....). When I move over to PS2s, I will start higher than 35 (38ish is my thought at the moment) and work my way down as well. You also need to consider the track / autoX courses you are driving. Road Atlanta is fast, and not particularly tight - you lean hard on your L/F in 1 and 12 at higher speeds, 4 is a left long sweeper on while the tight corners of 7 and 10a are slow and short. As for our local AutoXes, we have very fast courses (too fast sometime for the modern cars in my opinion) but as with any AutoX while you are hard on the tires, it is a very short period of time - I know some people have issues with tire wear in AutoX, and I think they may just be overdriving..... No one answer for everyone that is for sure. Driving style, course layout, suspension, all are factors. In any case, over 40 seems way out of wack. Regards!

If you are running SCCA stock classes, the best most competitive shocks Will be aluminum body racing shocks with 2 of the 4way adjustable controls epoxyed[after being adjusted]because only 2way shocks are legal,the epoxy converts the shocks to legal 2 ways.You'll need to adjust the adjustable spring perches to stock ride height with a new matched stock springs[collapsed to legally lower the car to legal minimum legal ride height]. Forget the street tires,only the Housiers A6s or Kumho 710s have a prayer of winning a National or divisional event. You'll need as much negetive camber up front as the stock camber adjustments will allow[and maybe a little more if it can't be spotted]. You'll need to adjust your tire pressure between every run so the pressures are the same for each run. The Hoosiers just get stickier as they heat up[that's the reason SCCA requires the 5min.wait between drivers] and they really like lots of negative camber[3-4 degrees]so you won't be able to do much street driving[the Hoosiers are good for 100 to 200 street miles and have a warning on the sidewall saying you risk death or injury running them on the street]. SCCA stock class has some of the most highly prepared racecars in the country. Share Share this post on Digg Del.icio.us Technorati Twitter Facebook!

Shocks are supposed to dampen sudden suspension movement; their purpose is not to change the roll stiffness of the car. I won't bother enumerating the various other factors like driving style and tire pressure that other commentators have already covered, but to me, if anything mechanical on the car changed the loading of the tires, it would be sway bars and springs, not the shocks.
