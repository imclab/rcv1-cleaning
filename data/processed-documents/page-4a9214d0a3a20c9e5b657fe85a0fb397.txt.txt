Ford Mustang Convertible Conversion - Coupe-To-Fastback Conversion: The Convertible Edition We Close Our Series This Month With The . . By John McGann , Photography by John McGann Car Craft , January, 2011  All good things must come to an end, so here is the finale-the coup de grâce to our coupe-to-fastback/convertible series that began three months ago in the Nov. '10 issue. To recap: We've been following the guys at Recon Classic Car Bodies as they transformed our long-suffering '67 coupe into a fastback in a matter of three days before our eyes. As if that weren't impressive enough, the Recon guys also made over a really gross '65 coupe into a cool 'vert, getting it done just under the wire before we were scheduled to head back to the cooler climate of Los Angeles after a week of baking in the Arizona heat.  Though we ran a similar picture in the Nov. '10 issue, here is another look at the body they started with. We're not sure there were more than 4 square inches of straight sheetmetal anywhere on this thing. Note the rollover damage on the roof and tweaked A-pillars. The guys stripped and cut this car the same way they did our fastback. Read last month's edition for the details. Though we ran a similar picture in the Nov. '10 issue, here is another look at the body th  Cut the roof off of any car and you lose a ton of structural rigidity. To compensate, convertibles come from the factory with extra supports and bracing. In fact, the stamping for the floor of a Mustang convertible is almost 2 inches narrower than a fastback because convertibles have these big reinforcing beams that attach to the inside of the rocker panels and span the distance from the front subframe to the rear leaf spring attaching points. The beams needed minor trimming before Recon owner Ray Carmody dropped them in place on the '65. Cut the roof off of any car and you lose a ton of structural rigidity. To compensate, conv  While his employees were finishing up our '67, Carmody got a jump on some of the bodywork on the '65. The doors were pretty gross, but not so bad that they needed to be replaced. Carmody hammered and filled the bigger ripples and sprayed them with Evercoat's Feather Fill G2, which is like spray-on metal glaze or finishing putty.

In addition to the rocker panel braces, Mustang convertibles have a lot of different support panels and other roof-mounting components, some of which are available in the aftermarket. Recon has been doing these conversions long enough that the crewmembers have templates drawn out to make their own. In addition to the rocker panel braces, Mustang convertibles have a lot of different suppo  They trace the patterns on 14- or 16-gauge sheetmetal (depending on if it is a structural component), cut them out with shears, and bend them in a brake.
