What's the name of a color? Remembering the first car you ever owned? These questions and more can be explored on PaintRef.com What makes our paint database different than all the rest? (1) We have a method to easily cross-reference the use of a paint formula on different automobile models, years, and paint manufacturers (2) We show the model/year paint code as well as the longer GM/Ford/Chrysler manufacturing paint code (3) Where ever possible we try to use the model/year promotional paint name which comes from sales brochures and we also have available for viewing (4) We show the corresponding codes of all major manufacturers of paint (OEM and touchup paints, we try to avoid alternative or complete repaint options because they don't match well) (5) We not only show scanned in paint chip pages but we also link them to the names and codes in in our database (ever try searching manually an online jpg image for a color name? Well, you can do that automatically in our site!) (6) In many cases we show examples of the paint, even on real cars. If not, check out the Google/Bing/Yahoo image search links for each color listed. (7) You can also search on generic color shades such as Orange or Red Corvette or 1969 Blue or Chyrsler Green , we even have summary lists which show the use of these color shades on a specific model throughout the years (i.e. Blue Mustang or Orange Camaro or Green Chevy Truck . Why do we do this? To understand the history of color usage as well as how codes and promotional names for the same paint have changed with time. For example, did you know that Firemist was a name given to a group of special metallic paints which primarily appeared on the Cadillac but also the Buick and Oldsmobile starting in 1964 and continuing to the present.
