Now hes back with another assault on your senses (and possibly your genitals) with Give It 2 U  an anthem informing you once again that even if youd rather not, youre getting it anyway. The new remix video featuring 2 Chainz and Kendrick Lamar has been released, and its here just for you. Luckily, Robins no longer dressed like a Foot Locker employee who youve asked nine times for a size 7 of those Chuck Taylors, only to be told hes working on it. He is in a pinstripe suit, though, so take that as you will. Also, please try not to let your love of Kendrick Lamar diminish because he was stupid enough to take part in this travesty. I seriously wonder whats wrong with Robin Thicke. Is he not jerking off enough? Does he have a sex addiction? Someone shed some light. Enjoy!

Well, turns out he wont have to pay for that crime either, as the case has been dismissed due to lack of evidence. BOO. Chris Browns existence should be evidence enough, but I suppose thats not how the court of law works. From TMZ: Good news for Chris Brown  for once  the singer WONT be prosecuted for allegedly attacking a female clubgoer at an O.C. bar back in June  TMZ has learned. We broke the story  24-year-old Deanna Gines claimed CB violently shoved her down at Heat Ultra Lounge  causing serious damage to her knee. But Deannas claims seemed fishy from the get go  CB and the clubs owner said she was full of it. Not to mention we got video of her walking around on her injured leg minutes after the alleged incident. Now, it seems the Anaheim City Attorney also smelled BS  cause the office rejected the case last week citing insufficient evidence. As for Deanna, shes still trying to sue Chris for her so-called suffering. Good luck with that. We should all be a little bit nicer to Chris, I suppose. He might have another seizure and it would be all our fault . Maybe this Deanna girl is just trying to make money off him, but I tend to side with anyone who hates Chris Brown.

Heres your chance! The boyband are coming out with their first fragrance, called One Moment. Theyve also released an ad for it which features the boys sniffing flowers and open bottles, holding fruit and being generally corny but sort of hilarious, as well. One Moment went on sale at Harrods over the weekend, and pre-orders were so numerous that theres now a waiting list to get a hold of one of the £21 (approximately $30) bottles. Apparently, only four samples of it were sent out to journalists prior to its release, as well. All of this for a celebrity perfume? Seems a bit much. That being said, if any publicists would like to send me a bottle to test and then immediately sell on eBay, please do!

This little appearance got some people without brains excited, thinking the boyband is back together and they might do a tour together. Not unheard of, but definitely not happening for these guys. JC Chasez let everyone down gently during an interview on Ryan Seacrest s KIIS-FM radio show (via DS ): It was just about five guys who were great friends, who spent 10 or 15 years together touring, and we wanted to give that back to our fans, but we were there mainly to support Justin. Literally just a few days ago, Justin gave me a buzz and he pretty much said, Hey man, listen, Im getting this award and theyve given me a pile of time to perform, and we started our careers at MTV and I think we should get the band back together. It really was about [Justin], and all that hes accomplished. He wanted to acknowledge that part of his career, and so we all decided to do it. Well, thats nice. If only Justin was struggling a bit more financially  it would really help these dudes out and go on a reunion tour. It would definitely sell out  nostalgia is really in right now.
