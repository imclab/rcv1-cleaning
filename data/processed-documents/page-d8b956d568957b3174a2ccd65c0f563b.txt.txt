Gurney. And when it comes to infusing humor into plays, Gurney is right up there again. Both are combined in "The Cocktail Hour," which Live Theatre Workshop opens in previews tonight. The story revolves around Bradley and Ann who love their martinis (only during the cocktail hour, of course), and their son, John, a playwright. John, however, has got a new subject for a play: his parents. He calls it "The Cocktail Hour," and he is on his way to his parents' house to get their nod of approval. Naturally, Bradley and Ann, through sips of several martinis, are quite concerned about what John has to say. Their reputation and all that, don'tchaknow. Be prepared to laugh. A lot. The production is directed by Rhonda Hallquist, who is making her LTW directing debut. Hallquist is a popular actress at the company - she's turned out wonderful performances in such productions as "Reckless" and "How I Learned to Drive." The cast, too, is made up of some LTW favorites, including Carlisle Ellis, who just finished her run at the theater in "Shirley Valentine," and Michael Woodson, who milked every laugh in such plays at "Taking Steps" and "What the Butler Saw" at LTW.
