Note from Ed: It is with great sadness that I am announcing that my friend Rene Isip has sold his Toyota store in Lewisville. I have known Rene for almost thirty years and been extremely proud of his accomplishments. The store was not sold due to a failure, but because of its incredible success, much of which is owed to Rene's GM Scott Fly. I only found out Sunday morning that the new owners would not be keeping Scott as previously promised. Therefore, while I wish them the best in their new endeavor - with our critical relationship broken we have removed that store from our recommended list.

I am 49 and always liked to listen to Paul Harvey. Your news stories, second hand news and history rank right there with him.  Paul I read your website every morning like I used to read the daily paper but with a much broader scope. Liz I wanted you to know that I find your web site and radio show news more in-depth, concise, accurate and useful than the minute-by-minute fire hose flow of idiocy that flows from the major and local news outlets.
