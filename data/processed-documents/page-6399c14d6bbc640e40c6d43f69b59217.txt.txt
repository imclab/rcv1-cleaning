I'd like to see a discussion on notability of the sources cited before this goes. Being mentioned in some obscure printed sources may be enough for notability in some cases. PS. Please ping me on talk if any arguments are presented here for my evaluation. -- Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus | reply here 07:42, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Those book hits are what I referred to in the nom. The book is simply a listing of Algerian artists as of 2006 and the second book is just an updated version of the first but as of 2011. Caffeyw ( talk ) 08:49, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Thanks for the reply. In this case the issue should be the reliability of the source. For example, I often work with the Polish Biographical Dictionary , and the consensus is that all individual in it are notable - even if our coverage of those topics is currently under 10%. -- Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus | reply here 09:31, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Ahmed Benyahia [ edit source  | edit ] Ahmed Benyahia ( edit | talk | history | protect | links | watch | logs ) – ( View AfD  · Stats ) ( Find sources:  "Ahmed Benyahiai" – news  · books  · scholar  · JSTOR  · free images )-- Great11 ( talk ) 01:23, 27 August 2013 (UTC) The sources talk about another thing non name of Ahmed Benyahia , i found only one, but Ahmed Benhayia have only one exposition( MENTION OF BOOK GOOGLE),it's not notable -- Great11 ( talk ) 01:17, 27 August 2013 (UTC) As at Hassane Amraoui , my comments on which I'm assuming are the reason my participation here was solicited, the big problem is the quality of sources. I just checked each one individually, and here's the rundown: two of them don't actually mention Benyahia's name at all , one is a dead or mistyped link whose content I'm unable to verify at all, and a couple just list his name while containing no actual content about him. Only one link leads to an article that actually uses his name in a larger context, and even that one isn't a particularly substantial article. As always I'm willing to reconsider this if stronger sources start showing up, but we're pretty clearly on the delete side of the see-saw here. Bearcat ( talk ) 02:03, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Comment i told keep for Hassane Amraoui and i accept the score delete 4 and keep 2 ( no problem), but It is not same thing when I compare the sources Hassane Amraoui 2 pages many expose , museum , gallery, cat, book, news of country , web site, critic of specialist of art and multicultural and philosophy dimension, and writer and poet in Algeria or Tunisia or Montreal) [1] but Ahmed Benyahia only one expose , Why????? [2] PAGE 148 we can consult the difference ( but I have a question he live in France for many years ....probably I can found another expose but the writer have neutrality and he is notable????!!!!!!. i accept the score 4 delete and 2 keep ( no problem).

Ping me if counter arguments are presented. -- Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus | reply here 08:02, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Comment - There's nothing mentioned about the subject, it's his name in passing. As for any book hits the book is just a listing of Algerian Artists, and the second is just an updated version of the 1st. No notability needed, just have to have painted a picture and be Algerian and you're listed in the book. Caffeyw ( talk ) 08:52, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Keep I have fixed the ref to La Tribune, (and the bare url which also pointed to it) by finding the original on the wayback machine. It is a substantial article in a reputable newspaper. It is always more difficult to write articles about subjects where the sources are not in English, and probably in Arabic script, rather than Roman script. I'll see what else I can find in due course.

On peut dire c'est un solitaire et le titre le mentionne. Si on veut garder l'article , on doit tout refaire puisque les référence n'ont pas de liens avec l'article. J'ai fait la demande sur wiki français pour supprimer l'article, elle a été vite traitée puisque les références sont en français. I transat For The Independent newspaper, yes it is notable saying it is a committed artist and the text speaks more worldview, the only comment I can take is thathe painting piece of theatre Kateb Yacine. We can say he is a lonely and the title says ( the indépendant). If you want to keep the item, we must redo everything because the reference is not related with the article.

If you painted one picture and are Algerian you would be included in the book. The second book is nothing but an updated version of the 1st. There's no articles about the subject, no reviews of their artwork. Basically someone went down the list of everyone in the book and created one line bios for all of them. The French Wiki doesn't even have pages for most of them, and the few that do are only one or two sentences.

I cannot understand JNW 's claim about "little or no rationale for notability", because WP:ARTIST / WP:AUTHOR is clearly met: Herbert Wetterauer has published several books and his artwork was featured in a number of exhibitions.-- FoxyOrange ( talk ) 17:01, 22 August 2013 (UTC) Comment I can't see that any of the criteria for WP:ARTIST / WP:AUTHOR are met. There's no indication that The person is regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by peers or successors; The person is known for originating a significant new concept, theory or technique; The person has created, or played a major role in co-creating, a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, that has been the subject of an independent book or feature-length film, or of multiple independent periodical articles or reviews ; or that The person's work (or works) either (a) has become a significant monument, (b) has been a substantial part of a significant exhibition, (c) has won significant critical attention, or (d) is represented within the permanent collections of several notable galleries or museums . Perhaps on the last criteria, Art-Collection Westermann, City-Gallery of Rastatt or One-Man-Show at the State Art Museum Baden-Baden offer some possibility, but neither is sourced, and there's little indication that either venue is significant--is either represented by a separate article on Wikipedia? The other galleries appear to be commercial or otherwise have no claim to notability. Similarly, merely publishing books establishes nothing, other than having published books.

No one said that his "writing one song" establishes his notability per se (although indeed sometimes writing one song does establish notability). Nadleman is primarily an artist whose work has been shown in various venues, so it would seem that outside evaluators have deemed his work worthy of exhibit. I think if we want to improve the encyclopedia we should not be wasting energy discussing and eliminating stubs but rather work on expanding them. Tvoz / talk 02:43, 21 August 2013 (UTC) True, but how long does a stub exist before it becomes obvious that it will not be expanded? This particular stub dates back to 2007. Wkharrisjr ( talk ) 15:07, 21 August 2013 (UTC) Delete . Simply being a stub isn't a defence to deletion. This article has no references establishing the notability of the subject—the first is a primary source (an autobiography) and the second is a chart listing for a different artist which doesn't mention Nadelman at all. — Psychonaut ( talk ) 17:18, 21 August 2013 (UTC) Relisted to generate a more thorough discussion so a clearer consensus may be reached.

And my first Google News search turned up only other people with similar names. But refining the search I found quite a few items at Google News. I have added several references to the (previously uncited) article; there were others behind paywalls. I think he may be notable enough for an article here. -- MelanieN ( talk ) 18:59, 23 August 2013 (UTC) Strong Keep In the world of origami, which most people don't really know much about in the first place, Jeremy Shafer is brilliant. He comes up with new designs about every other week, and figured out how to make Akira Yoshizawa's self-portrait just by looking at a picture of it (there are no diagrams). He has also published books and diagrams. I agree that this article can be improved, but it certainly should not be deleted. Thanks for any consideration of my input. Ensignricky ( talk ) 21:36, 26 August 2013 (UTC) Keep Jeremy Shafer is the top of his field; just because it is a fairly uncelebrated field doesn't mean it's unimportant or useless. Much like our pages on chess champs such as Garry Kasparov , he's a well-known figure in origami, and has plenty of fans and followers. If that doesn't make him "important" or "enough of a celebrity", then Wikipedia is denying its users the right of knowledge, which is the reason they come here in the first place. This page does require some development, but deletion is the last thing it needs.

AllyD ( talk ) 06:13, 20 August 2013 (UTC) Keep The article is about an art movement originated in 2010 and a manifest that the artist, Philip Henderickx and Marie Daelemans published in 2010, the manifest and the art movement refers to sources and terms used in those articles and so have a connection to this article. The sources that have been added have connection to the article as the manifesto reference to terms of surrealism / Fluxus / Happening / other noted articles. The article is not original research, it is an growing art movement in central Europe, several art manifestations happened under this term and so is larger than only the context of the artists mentioned in it. 81.82.215.154 ( talk ) 12:27, 20 August 2013 (UTC) — 81.82.215.154 ( talk • contribs ) has made few or no other edits outside this topic.

There is only one reference that appears to be about the concept. All other references are either about other topics or are closely associated with the artists. References need to be independent of the subject and need to indicate that there is usage of the term beyond the artists who created it. So far, there is no evidence of that. New art movements rarely gain enough traction to be able to be the topic of a Wikipedia article. Wikipedia is not meant to help establish a concept. It needs to be already established. freshacconci talk to me 13:58, 20 August 2013 (UTC) I will contact the artists to find more online references, however the mentioned articles in Bibliography are published articles on the matter, will update asap.

Need I remind people that neither a conflict of interest nor an article being "indulgent dross" are reasons for deletion? I would agree with David Eppstein that the article may require a complete rewrite to bring it up to standards, but articles in the LA Times, Il Giornale, Express India and Telegraph and possibly some Chinese-language publications establish notability as does the artist's exhibition record. There appear to be a number of other WP:RSs that further help pass both WP:GNG and WP:ARTIST . The conflict of interest can be dealt with and the "dross" can be edited out. If the book Personal Structures: Time-Space-Existence can be verified to include substantial material on the artist (I can't find a table of contents or index online), that would also go towards firmly establishing notability but I believe that is already established by the other sources available. freshacconci talk to me 15:39, 19 August 2013 (UTC) Keep .

Having your name mentioned in a list of every Algerian artist when you're an Algerian artist is not a sign of notability. Having an announcement by a radio station that you're going to be on the show, is not a sign of notability. A routine PR release stating he's having an exhibit does not show notability. A biography page written directly by the subject does not show notability. Bottom line, yes there's tons of hits for his name. However the hits are not in articles about the subject, they're all either 1)Routine PR releases, 2)Facebook type pages edited by the subject/his PR team, 3)Blogs - Which are mainly just re-posting the announcements/PR releases, 4)Bio pages written directly by the subject or 5)His name being mentioned along with everyone else that qualifies in a book listing all "Algerian Artists". Yes I took a look at each page you posted, they're all the same missing the same things.

Reliable sources are media coverage (newspapers, books, magazines, etc.) which is independent of the subject himself. Press releases do not count; his own website does not count; the webpages of galleries that have booked shows with him do not count; Wordpress blog entries do not count. And it is not sufficient for his name to merely be mentioned on a page (routine event listings, simple lists of artists, etc.), either. It is not enough to just be able to show sources which demonstrate that he exists ; he has to be the primary subject of substantial coverage in reliable sources . So no, I'm sorry, but not even one of those links gets him past WP:GNG . (The Radio-Canada link would count if it was to the real interview, but not if it's just to the episode summary .) Show me articles about him in the arts section of Le Devoir or Le Journal de Montréal , show me a television interview on Radio-Canada 's or TVA 's arts magazine shows, show me he's been on Désautels (or dig out the actual Tam-Tam interview and not just the listing), show me feature articles about him in real magazines, and then maybe we'll talk.

It asserts notability as a counterculture writer of multiple books and is supported by verifiable , independent references. red dog six ( talk ) 02:51, 26 August 2013 (UTC) I actually have to argue against many of the sources as far as notability giving goes. IMDb isn't usable to show notability as anyone can edit it. Merchant sources such as Amazon and CD Universe are really discouraged in general for the obvious reasons (the sites' purpose is to sell you things), and many of the other sources are primary. The NIU source is good, albeit maybe slightly trivial in nature, and the Hartford Courant article is also good. All in all, those are probably the only two sources I'd keep, but we definitely need more as far as showing solid notability goes. I don't think (or at least I hope) that sources will be that hard to find, though. Tokyogirl79 (｡◕‿◕｡) 04:24, 26 August 2013 (UTC) Keep . Now that I've cleaned out the blatantly unusable sources, I've managed to add in just enough to where it should be a comfortable enough keep. Now what I didn't add were the amount of sources that listed some of his books as various sources and recommended reading. Here are some of them: [49] , [50] , [51] , [52] , [53] , [54] , [55] , pharmacology textbook ). Some of what I've listed are "pop culture" type books, but Margolis is listed in some textbooks as well. I have a feeling that there is probably more out there that isn't on the internet, which isn't entirely surprising given the time period. There's enough to suggest that his work is still considered relatively influential today. He's not Timothy O'Leary, but he's still notable enough.

I had begun to clean up the article ( original version can be seen here ) and quickly found out that there just isn't enough reliable sources to show that Hendricks is particularly noteworthy. His article had only one thing that I could even begin to use as a reliable source and that looks to be local coverage since he lives in Nelson County, which is somewhat close to Lynchburg. He seems to have been somewhat prolific, but not to the point where he'd pass as someone who made an extraordinary contribution to the genre of non-fiction books on fantasy football. I can't see where he's considered to be overwhelmingly notable or important within his niche, (to where he'd be cited several times) as there doesn't seem to really be any in-depth articles about him. The only places that cover him are sites that really wouldn't pass as reliable sources per Wikipedia's guidelines. I don't see where RotoNation.com is really usable as a RS since I can't actually locate the site specifically (it redirects to KFFL, which has no articles on him) and many of the other things that were previously used as sources were just basic links to websites- some of which were primary sources. I just don't see where he particularly warrants an article. I have no problem with someone wanting to userfy this and dig for sources over time, but right now I just don't see where he merits an article.

I find this argument disingenuous. The nominator clearly called out the article as potentially failing WP:PROF in the original nomination. This is a completely valid deletion rationale, and the fact that he worded it as a question rather than a clear statement should not be a reason for keeping. — David Eppstein ( talk ) 00:26, 26 August 2013 (UTC) Comment You may consider my remark disingenuous, David Eppstein and I get your point. But I believe that (except in the case of procedural noms on behalf of IP editors or newbies), a nomination should clearly state that the nominator has concluded the article should be deleted, and why. A nomination shouldn't implicitly ask other editors to do the groundwork described in WP:BEFORE , and as DGG has so graciously done here.

I do not see any reason why I have to repeat myself. Barney the barney barney ( talk ) 11:06, 25 August 2013 (UTC) Nope, Dusti's action was acceptable — you don't have to agree with their decision, but they were entirely within their right to make it. Your first nomination consisted of a question as to whether the article met WP:PROF or not — you did not advance a reasoned, comprehensive argument that it objectively failed to meet our inclusion rules, but merely asked for other people to investigate whether it did or not. As noted, there are things you can do — take it to WP:N/N , for example — if you have questions about an article's notability and want further investigation , but AFD is not the correct process to use until you can provide clear, unambiguous evidence that the article definitely fails to meet one or more of our inclusion rules and should definitely be deleted on those grounds. An AFD discussion without a deletion rationale can be closed at any time by anyone , and your nomination did not include a deletion rationale — and furthermore, the discussion had in fact been open for a full week already without anyone posting either a keep or deletion rationale. I am an administrator, and I might very well have closed it too if I'd seen it before all of this happened. You certainly do have the right to reopen a new discussion as you've done here — but I do have to warn you that if you don't stop criticizing Dusti and start discussing the article , you are running the risk of a temporary editblock for violating WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA . Bearcat ( talk ) 22:38, 25 August 2013 (UTC) Comment . As with Cullen328's comment earlier, this "keep" comment fails to address the deletion rationale (i.e., whether the subject passes WP:PROF ), nor does it provide any other policy-based reason for keeping other than the failure to understand the clearly-worded and policy-based rationale for the previous discussion. — David Eppstein ( talk ) 00:29, 26 August 2013 (UTC) delete, possibly speedy delete as G11 The reason given for deletion was specified as it being questionable whether the individual meets WP:PROF, a perfectly good reason for listing an article here. Asking the nominator to specify it in more exact words insteadtead of saying " Can we check whether this meets WP:PROF please" is mere quibbling--the meaning of the deletion reason is perfectly clear. I consider it reasonable for people to bring a questionable article here and ask for opinions; I do this routinely when it looks dubious but is out of my subject. There is two additional very good reasons for deletion, even deletion via speedy: The biographical part of the article is in large part a copy or very close paraphrase of his bio at Moffit Cancer Center here , and it is an entirely promotional article that would need extensive rewriting beyond normal editing. Personally, I do not think the person is notable enough to be worth doing it. And there is another reason to avoid doing it: the author of this article appears to be an entirely promotional editor writing articles about physicians at the Moffit Cancer Center--and I see no reason to myself do properly the work they are (presumably) being paid for and doing improperly. There is a concentrated campaign at WP for articles on robotic surgery and its practitioners, and this is just one part of it. (I suspect it is an attempt to use us as part of a sales competition between the major manufactures of the multi-million dollar machines used in the field) First, with respect to notability. The relevant criterion in WP:PROF is the person being a recognized authority is their subject. For scientific fields, this is normally judged on the basis of citations of the individual's papers. The citations for his most cited papers in Google Scholar are 123, 105, 91, in good journals. The h value is 21. This is not spectacular in the field, but it's good. He is not one of the leading workers in the field: a GS search on the subject shows many papers on vitamin E and cancer with citation ranging from 200 to 3000. He has been on the editorial board of some important journals is his subject, though that alone is not notability, as these are large editorial boards of several dozen people. He has not been on the editorial board of a major journal. (corrected, Aug.26) He is an officer in no national professional association, he is an elected fellow of no professional society, his academic positions have been only as Associate Professor Second, about the promotionalism. The article freely uses adjectives of praise: "many papers"; ":most notable". the "Awards" section consists of directory listings, extremely minor awards, and student awards, and within-university awards. There's nothing here which should even be mentioned in a bio article. The professional work section consists of an overextend discussion mixing in his totally unimportant work with his more important work showing no signs of discriminating between the two. The section on surgical work and his work on preventative guidelines talks about activities where he was a "major player" , or had "involvement" or was "one of the first..." . Etc. etc. I am not particularly happy at Barney letting me do all this checking, instead of trying himself, but he did find an article that needs to be removed. I shall be nominating other related articles for deletion. DGG ( talk ) 16:42, 25 August 2013 (UTC) Keep Seems to meet the standards of WP:PROF specifically: 1. The person's research has made significant impact in their scholarly discipline, broadly construed, as demonstrated by independent reliable sources In this case Malafa appears to have strong Google scholar rankings, author or co-author of a few hundred papers, cited all over the place. It is evident that he has made a significant impact in his scholarly discipline That being said, I do think that the page could use some work. However there's a long stretch of road between "needs work" and "delete." Simonm223 ( talk ) 00:35, 26 August 2013 (UTC) Weak delete . In his specialty, the use of Vitamin E for cancer prevention/amelioration: Google scholar found citation counts of 1552, 960, 674, 651, 541, etc. I conclude from this that this is a high-citation area and that his own citation counts, 123, 105, etc (while nothing to sneeze at) are not enough to make a convincing case for WP:PROF#C1 . What else is there? Chair of a department is clearly not a high enough level administrative position for WP:PROF, and the awards listed in the article are certainly too low-level to count for much. And I also agree with the promotional language and conflict-of-interest concerns raised by DGG. If he were more clearly notable, I'd suggest stubbing it down to something neutral and better-sourced, but in this case because of the borderline notability and COI issues I think WP:TNT is a better choice. — David Eppstein ( talk ) 00:40, 26 August 2013 (UTC) Comment : While there are many articles and institutions investigating the role of Vitamin E in cancer prevention, each group investigates specific aspects of this problem: rectal cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, etc. A quick look at the articles which cite the subject's research will show that only he has conducted research on whether α-TOS can prevent melanoma , for example. Also, the fact that the subject's research is routinely cited, even when the article is dealing with a different application of Vitamin E than the subject deals with, demonstrates, in accordance with WP:PROF , the subjects' broad attribution as a pioneer in this area of research: "the [subject] has pioneered or developed a significant new concept, technique or idea, made a significant discovery or solved a major problem in their academic discipline." 72.184.149.224 ( talk ) 15:22, 26 August 2013 (UTC) If you restrict the author's specialization to Vitamin E for melanoma, this will eliminate three of his five top-cited papers. And even in that highly-specialized subtopic, he does not have the most highly-cited paper (that one is by Prasad and Edwards-Prasad). — David Eppstein ( talk ) 00:19, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Comment I have copyedited a bit, correcting typos and errors. I have removed puffery and promotionalism, including two mentions of the brand name of the robotic surgery gear that he now uses. I have trimmed away some unreferenced material. I am not claiming that the article is without flaws, but I've tried to attack its most glaring defects. Two editors I respect, DGG and David Eppstein have recommending deleting while conceding that notability may be possible. DGG described the citation count as "good" but "not spectacular". David Eppstein called the citations "nothing to sneeze at" and conceded "borderline notability". Both expressed concern about promotionalism and COI editing, which can be addressed through the normal editing process, and which I have tried to do in recent hours. I concede that I am weak in assessing the notability of academics, since I am a guy with a bachelor's degree not now involved in academia. But I don't think that the TNT essay applies here, since I honestly don't see the article as "hopelessly irreparable". I encourage everyone participating in this debate to make a thoughtful, constructive edit or three to this article, and add it to your watch lists. Thanks. Cullen 328 Let's discuss it 04:03, 26 August 2013 (UTC) A year ago I would have agreed with you. What I think we need to do here is add the most important academic people, with the priority for the notable ones, not the ones who havePR agents. If this were an isolated article, I would feel differently, but why should either you or I work at helping someone make all the articles for the borderline people at a particular medical institute? Neither notability nor promotionalism is a black/white issue. In the past I'd keep anything where Notability was borderline unless it was total advertising. Now I would remove anything borderline unless there is no taint of promotionalism, and I would personally not bother rewriting a promotional article unless the subject were actually famous. If I can find a way or proposing this as a formal deletion criterion I will. The danger to WP is not in including marginal articles, but rather is including promotionalism. With different standards of notability, we'd be a more or less complete encyclopedia; with respect to advertising, we wouldn't be an encyclopedia at all. But I will say, that if it is kept, I will fix it further, rather than have it totally misrepresent his importance. Incidentally, I mentioned that he is only an associate professor; a less sophisticated editor would have said this--this avoids saying he has any academic rank at a med school at all, because it would have to say what it was. This is sophisticated WP-aware promotional writing, and therefore all the more dangerous. DGG ( talk ) 04:31, 26 August 2013 (UTC) If this is "sophisticated" PR writing, then that industry is not capable of fooling people like you. I can see trying to slip in the brand name of the robotic surgery system, but twice? And scrambling up where he was raised? The reason I chose to try to improve the article is that I am a volunteer and it caught my interest. I can work on any article I want to, and I get some strange pleasure occasionally from saving articles I discover at AfD. I would rather work on a biography of a research physician than an article on an internet meme or anime character. As for him being "only" an associate professor, I don't think that is incompatible with notability at all. Cullen 328 Let's discuss it 04:45, 26 August 2013 (UTC) sophisticated = relatively sophisticated. For the usual really crude stuff, watch CSD. As for associate professors, although it's not a bar, very few of them have ever been found notable here, even from the most important research universities. Personally, I'd put the bar for WP:PROF lower, at a level which would generally include associate professors at major research universities on the same principle as we don't require musicians to have multiple hit records, or professional athletes to play at that level for more than one single game. I get greatest pleasure help in helping individuals, next greatest in helping borderline articles. I now get pleasure only in helping the ones not the products of PR. Tell me, if you wanted to add researchers who made a contribution to the relationship between vitamin E and cancer, wouldn't you want to write articles on the ones with the most notable work? And in fact the most notable work is that vitamin E supplementation has a detrimental effect on cancer,  this referred to in the relevant WP articles, although none of the lead researchers there have WP articles. . (not that his work shows otherwise--if you read careful--it's entirely pre-clinical studies on cell lines and mice.) The impression the article gives, however, is very different, and could best be helped by removing the word cancer from the article so it doesn't show up prominently in G searches for the subject, which it currently does. Unfortunately, this is impossible since whatever minor importance he has a surgeon is in treating cancer. So the net effect of keeping this article is to promote an untested theory which is against the weight of all medical evidence, If we do keep this article i will reduce section 4.1 to one sentence in the research paragraph. DGG ( talk ) 16:59, 26 August 2013 (UTC) BTW I made an error above: he is not on the editorial board of any major journal, just the minor journal published by his own research center: he "has provided ad hoc reviews" for major journals--something so utterly routine for any scientist with a PhD even with no faculty position whatsoever, that it doesn't even contribute to significant content, let alone to notability, and is always removed from articles along with the other fluff. DGG ( talk ) 17:07, 26 August 2013 (UTC) Comment He is a medical researcher and MD. I'm not sure why this was cross-posted to the Academic  Educators list. I'm not sure within the field of medical research whether he is considered notable but I think different standards apply than are used to assess academic notability. L iz Read! Talk! 20:12, 26 August 2013 (UTC) Delete Does not pass the admittedly high criteria for WP:ACADEMIC , and of course not even close to WP:GNG . He appears to be a successful but run-of-the-mill surgical oncologist. His citations at Google Scholar are OK but nothing to indicate he is a thought leader in his field has made significant impact in his scholarly discipline; his positions held are not remarkable; and the awards listed are trivial. -- MelanieN ( talk ) 21:30, 26 August 2013 (UTC) WP:Prof does not require a person to be a "thought leader".

The rest are primary sources. There may be a few more sources on this old revision: Irregular Webcomic! Googling also turned up a few other sources BrickComicNetwork interview , Erdös number (whatever that's worth), something about an art gallery . a blog covering Darths  Droids , another blog covering Darths  Droids . I imagine there would be further sourcing relating to his other projects. OSborn arf contribs. 15:33, 24 August 2013 (UTC) The art gallery thing is a directory listing that only mentions him in passing, and the two blogs are unreliable self-published sources . Ten Pound Hammer • ( What did I screw up now? ) 16:21, 24 August 2013 (UTC) The blogs are reliable non-independent sources. Non-independent sources can still be reliable, as in this case. -- JHunterJ ( talk ) 16:24, 24 August 2013 (UTC) What makes them reliable? They appear to be just some random joe's blogs. Are the people who wrote them notable, or experts in their field? Ten Pound Hammer • ( What did I screw up now? ) 16:26, 24 August 2013 (UTC) WP:ABOUTSELF . -- JHunterJ ( talk ) 11:46, 25 August 2013 (UTC) Doesn't apply. If David wrote those blogs himself, then they'd be fine. But he didn't. WP:ABOUTSELF is about sources, well, about yourself. And David didn't write either blog. Try again. Ten Pound Hammer • ( What did I screw up now? ) 13:16, 25 August 2013 (UTC) You and I are referring to different citations then. Try again, with more specification. -- JHunterJ ( talk ) 15:59, 25 August 2013 (UTC) I see my confusion. I thought the blogs above were repeats of the ones in the article, including the author's own. -- JHunterJ ( talk ) 16:27, 25 August 2013 (UTC) Delete fails WP:BIO. as discussed above, most of the sources are not indepth or do not meet reliable sources. also trove search doesn't show much either. LibStar ( talk ) 01:41, 26 August 2013 (UTC) WP:BIO doesn't require most of the sources to do anything, just that sufficient sources meet the standard. None of the sources on the page are unreliable. -- JHunterJ ( talk ) 11:32, 26 August 2013 (UTC) So by that logic, I could have a Wikipedia article because of the three or four articles in my local paper that just mentioned me in passing. WP:GNG , which supercedes WP:BLP , says "If a topic has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject, it is presumed to satisfy the inclusion criteria for a stand-alone article or stand-alone list." I'm not seeing any significant coverage. A whole bunch of name-drops and primary sources do not notability make. Ten Pound Hammer • ( What did I screw up now? ) 17:34, 27 August 2013 (UTC) No, that's not the same logic. Wired.com (a short article about Morgan-Mar's interaction with Jane Goodall), MakeUseOf (a section on Morgan-Mar's Piet), and e23 (about Morgan-Mar's GURPS  Pyramid work) are not three or four articles in your local paper mentioning you in passing. -- JHunterJ ( talk ) 17:47, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Chris Kendall [ edit source  | edit ] Chris Kendall ( edit | talk | history | protect | links | watch | logs ) – ( View AfD  · Stats ) ( Find sources:  "Chris Kendall" – news  · books  · scholar  · JSTOR  · free images ) A user proposed deletion of this article for the following reason: Seems to fail WP:N and WP:ENT .

His articles are cogent and well researched. He is a prolific writer for on line sites like Frontpage and Pajamas Media and covers a range of issues. He is not only notable but is going to become even more so now that he has begin to write books as well. Gidmeister ( talk ) 12:20, 26 August 2013 (UTC) David Hornik is a "boots-on-the-ground," articulate and HONEST voice from Israel. One may disagree with his opinion, but it is disingenuous to argue with the facts he presents. Should he be removed it would be a disservice to the truth...and isn't that what Wikipedia is SUPPOSED to be all about? Newmediajournal ( talk ) 12:44, 26 August 2013 (UTC) David Hornik has a long and distinguished record of commentary on major websites. Disagree or not with his views, he has an enviable record of accurate and pertinent analysis. It would be a disservice to those seeking knowledge to delete his Wikipedia entry. One of the strengths of Wikipedia is the breadth of information it provides on account of the enormous number of entries available. Deletion of his entry would serve no useful public purpose.

The NYT article is about happy Danes in general and doesn't even mention Sharmi Albrechtsen, she's mentioned only in passing in one of the other links and is just one of many names mentioned as references in another. And the Indiaeveryday-link is a just long list of videos containing the name "Sharmi" in the title, mostly music videos with an artist by that name. Baerdorf is a brand new SPA account, obviously created specifically for this AfD-discussion, so I would like to point out that this AfD is not about getting as many "keep" votes as possible (that is it is not a majority vote) but about seeing if the subject of the article, Sharmi Albrechtsen, is notable enough to have an article here (see WP:Notability ).

As for following you around (I assume you are referring to the fact that I edited the Alice Crimmins article, where your additions have now been removed by multiple editors), it is quite normal to check the contributions of a user who displays some level of incompetence . As for Bremner, who is the subject of this discussion, it seems to me that you have no idea what "self-published" means. To have publishers like Wiley and Penguin agree to publish your book, you need to do a lot more than just write the book: you will have to go through an extensive review process and having them accept your book proposal is a major accomplishment for an academic. It's nothing like sending your manuscript to one of those vanity publishers and paying them to publish your book for you. And although I'm an old fart who thoroughly dislikes ebooks, I don't see what's wrong with having Kindle versions of a book. And where do you get the "ten copies sold" information from? I don't think that Wiley or Penguin have ever published a book that did not at least sell several hundred copies. As you say indeed: Please! -- Randykitty ( talk ) 11:20, 23 August 2013 (UTC) Speedy keep . Being an autobio is not a reason for deletion, at most a reason to rewrite an article in a neutral way, if necessary. Given Bremner's stature, the article is remarkably neutral. Let me just give some citation statistics from Web of Science : 238 publications listed, cited 14885 times, with an h-index of 65. Top 5 citation counts: 1290, 791, 731, 556, and 350. Just one of those is normally enough here for a "keep" decision. Article certainly needs cleanup and expansion, but Bremner passes WP:ACADEMIC without any possible doubt.

However, it makes pretty bold statements with regard to this person's political activity, which may very well be exaggerated, like claiming him to be a 'democracy activist', which a sample check revealed not to be supported by any reliable sources. The fact that the article has mainly been edited by one user who has not contributed to any other articles on Wikipedia since his/her registration, and also the fact that articles about this person were created en masse in other languages around the same time by the same user, albeit consisting of one or two sentences each, suggest that this may be a case of WP:SELFPROMOTE .

There are other Colombian newspapers El Colombiano and El Espectador - about 130 results, I have not gone through them but my sense is someone doesn't win all these awards internationally, have so many mentions in multiple Colombian newspapers, without being a notable poet, a profession not known for this sort of attention at a young age.

Cathfolant ( talk ) 18:21, 26 August 2013 (UTC)  Comment I kindly want to clarify some items the user Martssnail has mentioned. First of all, Vélez really won the Premio Nacional de Periodismo Simón Bolívar. The confusion is due to the fact that that award is given in different categories for various kinds of journalism. They do have prizes in different modalities: Interview, Criticism, Opinion journalism, Investigative journalism and so on. In 2010, María Elvira Samper won in the modality “All a life in journalism” and Sergio Esteban Vélez was awarded for the best interview made in Colombia in that year. It is the same as at the Oscars for films: in that competition, in the same year, there are prizes for many people in different specialties, and all they are called “Oscar winners”. I am also surprised to learn that you consider that Vélez' resume is not outstanding at all. You should take into account that he has been publishing articles in Colombian newspapers for more than ten years. Although he is still very young (29), he is columnist of one of the most important newspapers of Colombia and he has become one of the most relevant cultural journalists in Colombia. His work in the newspaper El Mundo has made of him an important voice among his people. His resume includes not only his career as a journalist, but also his trajectory as a poet. Still a boy, he had already published three poetry books and he became known as a child prodigy and well known among the intellectuals of Medellin, his city. That fame is alive still today, and regardless of the fact that he is no longer living at his country since several years ago, he continues analyzing and reviewing the important news of culture in Colombia. I have checked many other resumes of Colombian writers and journalists on Wikipedia, and I found that many of them do not show enough notability or that they have less notoriety than Sergio Esteban Vélez has. Thus, I request you to reconsider your opinions -- Beausejour15 ( talk ) Relisted to generate a more thorough discussion so a clearer consensus may be reached. Please add new comments below this notice. Thanks, Mark Arsten ( talk ) 11:47, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Hello Beausejour15, of cause there are other articles about writers that are not notable but please take note of Wikipedia:Conflict of interest . In the four years since 2009 in all 31 Wikipedias it was only one anonymous user, now living in Canada ( IP 132.208.73.76 ), who wrote about this person. So it's pretty obvious why the Spanish Wikipedia deleted the text as "artículo de autopromoción". Sergio Vélez, "actuellement, il habite au Québec", might be a promising young journalist but he is certainly not a famous Columbian writer ("un famós escrivan colombian") as the anonymous user (you?) claims. -- Martssnail ( talk ) 12:24, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Geena the Latina [ edit source  | edit ] Geena the Latina ( edit | talk | history | protect | links | watch | logs ) – ( View AfD  · Stats ) ( Find sources:  "Geena the Latina" – news  · books  · scholar  · JSTOR  · free images ) Cohost on a local FM radio station; notability not demonstrated and I could not find significant coverage in a search.

It says "was featured in 944 magazine “The Tranplants” (May 2009 issue)" but no link or info what depth of coverage.

As I have stated several times, and certainly bears repeating again and again, it is well within the rights of the community to impose such a requirement. Also, I would like to see the exact policy which clarifies this matter (if such a policy exists), as I would like to bring that up at some point and work towards reassessing such an incredibly flawed and incorrect policy. Furthermore, as history has proven over the years, Wikipedia functions as a community-led project. The community has every right to impose any restriction so long as there is consensus to impose such restrictions. This is exactly how current policies have ultimately been formulated, as a result of discussion and debate among community members. Change is good. That bears plenty of repetition, doesn't it? Laval ( talk ) 15:07, 27 August 2013 (UTC) I have to agree with Postdlf here. If I had found significant coverage about her in Spanish-language media, I would have considered her to be notable. As I noted, I did search for "Geena la Latina" specifically to see if I could find any Spanish language coverage. -- MelanieN ( talk ) 15:10, 27 August 2013 (UTC) @ Laval :, within WP:V at WP:NONENG ("Citations to non-English sources are allowed."), and within WP:N at WP:GNG ("Sources may encompass published works in all forms and media, and in any language"). Both exactly where you'd expect to find the issue addressed. What did you read that made you think the contrary? It's one thing to assert what you think policy should be; it's another thing to assert it as if you think it's already policy when, in fact, policy expressly says the opposite. The former is an opinion; the latter is a mistake. At any rate, WP:VPP is the place to propose such a wide-reaching change, not within individual AFD!votes, though I'd recommend you not waste your time because there is zero chance of that gaining consensus. postdlf ( talk ) 15:22, 27 August 2013 (UTC) Delete Doesn't seem to meet WP:ENTERTAINER .

I know, hypnotism, but this was taken seriously for a time as a medical treatment and he helped pioneer it, according to this source. [81] One of his books was reviewed in The American Journal of Psychology [82] . He was called a "leading medical hypnotist" in the New York Times (07 Aug 1954, "Asthma Laid to Tensions"). For anyone searching most results found as "S. J. van Pelt". -- Green Cardamom ( talk ) 05:36, 18 August 2013 (UTC) Keep Meets WP:ACADEMIC as the editor-in-chief of a notable journal.

Some caveats about Medline in WP:NJournals , not an automatic notability. And only 1 year's (volume) of the journal were indexed (out of 17). [83] Looks like one good source (Gravitz, Melvin (1987)). Still believe Van Pelt, his Society and his Journal would be notable as a single article, harder to justify three articles. No information would be lost combining and maintain redirects. -- Green Cardamom ( talk ) 18:07, 18 August 2013 (UTC) That remark in NJournals is because many people equate PuBMed and MEDLINE. The latter is selective, but the former contains not only MEDLINE-indexed journals, but also journals that are in PubMed Central , which are not necessarily notable. That this journal was indexed for only 1 year is not much of a problem, I think. It's not like it was delisted by MEDLINE or something like that, indexing stopped simply because the journal folded. Both the journal and the society have histories independent of van Pelt, so I don't think that merging them there is appropriate. The histories of the journal and society, however, do overlap, so merging the society into the journal article makes most sense to me. -- Randykitty ( talk ) 19:29, 18 August 2013 (UTC) OK good enough. I've change my vote to Keep and worry about merge elsewhere. -- Green Cardamom ( talk ) 02:30, 19 August 2013 (UTC) ┌ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ┘ Comment , with a question: So is the idea to keep the article and improve it, then? Whether or not the answer to that is a yes, I have sincere and serious questions about having three, let alone this one article or an article composed of the three articles. For what it's worth, hypnotism as a page is very poorly done, especially with its treatment of its medical uses, legitimacy, or efficacy. Whether or not a journal is indexed by MEDLINE/PubMed/Ovid/WoK/WoS/G Scholar/whatever shouldn't in and of itself be a sign of a journal's notability or lack thereof, in the case of those that aren't indexed. However, these do roughly indicate whether a journal may be notable enough. My main complaint with the British Journal of Medical Hypnotism is that medical libraries and other academic libraries do not carry this journal, either as hard-copy versions or e-journals. In fact, in order to determine whether this was notable, I had to go out of my way to hunt down issues of this journal. Further, this isn't a journal with any significant readership and isn't particularly well cited, even in its area of academic rigour. Its contributors do not, in fact, number that many. As for Dr. van Pelt himself, his work does not seem to have lasted the test of time and he has not left enough of a legacy. van Pelt appears not have be adequately notable per the appropriate notability criteria. As an alumnus of the Sydney Medical School, he does not appear to be recorded in the School's annals, which is further suggestive of his lack of having made enough of a mark to be included on Wikipedia. --Qwerty Binary ( talk ) 10:49, 23 August 2013 (UTC) Relisted to generate a more thorough discussion so a clearer consensus may be reached.

It's a mess of linkspam, namedropping and notability by association. This page has a lot of sources but few are any good. Mostly a mix of primary sources, activist organisations and social media sites. The activist organisations are not reliable sources and those she has an involvement are not independent. One reliable source used is the Australian [84] but that is just thrown in to to make the page look better, verifying a fact that has nothing to do with Sursara. The one reasonable verifiable source is the news.com.au story about identity theft. That one is more an example of indentity theft than it is coverage of her and this one event is just routine news coverage . If this source is good enough to build a BLP then one would be best served by starting from scratch. The basic premise of that article is identity theft and any BLP built from it would have to primarily focus on that subject which is barely covered in this page. That one source is also used deceptively. The piece has little biographical coverage about her beyond saying she is a "Queensland conservationist' who "is an ambassador for the Australia Zoo’s Wildlife Hospital, WWF’s Earth Hour and the Sea Shepherd". In the Wikipedia page this article is used to "verify" many things. The vague claim "She is actively involved in the mediation of cruelty to animals and promotes a sustainable lifestyle." Not said in the news article. "Sursara is the ambassador for the World Wildlife Fund climate change campaign Earth Hour, for WSPA and for Australia Zoo’s Wildlife Warriors" One out of three only. "and has served as an Antarctic campaigns crew member with the organization since 2012, appearing on Animal Planet’s documentary series Whale Wars" Not said in the news article. "Sursara is considered of influence regarding environmental conservation and wildlife". Not said in the news article. "She is the ambassador for climate change campaign Earth Hour[4] by the WWF with Miranda Kerr, Peter Garrett and Mat McHugh of The Beautiful Girls, for WSPA Australia’s Humane Chain and Voices of Influence, and for Steve Irwin's Australia Zoo Wildlife Warriors program." Partialy only and does not include the namedropping. "In May 2012, Sursara collaborated with WSPA as an ambassador to their campaign to end live export, Humane Chain. ..." Not said in the news article. "Sursara is affiliated with and/or supports organizations including ....." Most organisations not mentioned in the news article. (On identity theft) "The phenomenon received considerable media attention" Wow, something right. But not really about her. "In a 2012 feature story for The Daily Telegraph, journalist Tory Shepherd revealed there were more than 500 MySpace accounts from users claiming to be Elissa Sursara during the height of her impersonations, and discussed the negative and positive impact of identity theft on Sursara's professional and personal life." Feature story? Comes close to being true but Shepard didn't reveal that number, she reported that Sursara claimed that number. This Wikipedia article is just the editors prefered puff piece with sources badly thrown in to give an appearence of being properly referenced. A search for usable coverage came up short, finding stuff by her and passing mentions. Nothing good enough for WP:GNG . She falls short as an actor . There is a lack of significant roles, lots of bit parts. While the filmography has many blue links that is just due to a sockpuppet making new pages for many of the films and those articles show no sign that the films are notable, just building a walled garden. This article was built by a series of single purpose accounts many of which have now been blocked due to sockpuppetry ( SPI ). Of the earlier SPAs The checkUser from the SPI notes "It is likely that there are more stale socks in the history of Elissa Sursara". These socks have brought personal vendetta into Wikipedia, turning it into a battlefield (see the SPI and Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Omar Todd (3rd nomination) ). Given the lack of coverage and the bad faithed gaming of the system this article should be deleted. Deny them the fruits of their abuse.

However, I can't get past certain things that show notability: News.co.au calls her "high-profile". [85] She had a feature in Girlfriend magazine (July 2013) [86] and this interview in Girl [87] . That's three biographical pieces, enough material to write an article with, plus all the other briefer sources that add up. There's a fourth bio piece in ELLE Magazine according to the article but is inaccessible online. She is rumored to be the new official "Face of Australia", replacing Hugh Jackman as the promoter of Australian tourism. [88] A US travel expert said that "She defines Australia and everyone identifies with her" (previous link). However this is purely rumor and there is no validating source - it could be sophisticated PR planting a seed in hopes of creating grassroots support. Or it could be true, who knows, too soon to tell. I'm not using that source in the article obviously but something to watch over the next months. The nom's concern about puffrey is accurate, the article needs a redo from top to bottom given its history of SPA. (for readability post replies below this line and reference paragraph #s) -- Green Cardamom ( talk ) 20:13, 16 August 2013 (UTC) 1. Just being high profile (is she really? Why so little coverage?) doesn't equal notable. The dolly article is by her. The girl piece is just her talking about herself, no independent editorial analysis (and I question wether they are a reliable source). Neither are good for WP:GNG. There is still a lack of independent coverage. The Elle piece, was it about or by her? Was it just online, if so it's now gone so not verifiable. Was it in the mag itself, if so what issue, the mag does not have a date like the one supplied. Who wrote it? What sort of piece? I don't trust the authors of this pageso how can we know it's useable? 2. Yes, rumoured. So too soon for this to be useful.

There's a lot of non-notable fluff in the article, as the nominator points out, cited to random websites. However, that presents more of a clean-up issue rather than reason for deletion. Unfortunately her victimisation online and her connection to Justin Bieber seem to be more important to the media than her environmentalism - I've yet to find the origins of her reputation as an influential eco-spokesperson.

Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 10:56, 15 August 2013 (UTC) Comment All this material can also be found on Humayun Azad . Hence it should be removed from the main article or this should be deleted/redirected. I'm not sure he quite needs a separate bibliography, but it's reasonable to carry this information somewhere since almost all notable writers have some form of Wikipedia bibliography either in their main article or as a spin-out. Even if you believe some of these books do not exist, that is not grounds for deletion, only editing. -- Colapeninsula ( talk ) 11:46, 15 August 2013 (UTC) Having a list article as a content fork when an article gets too large is a good idea. Having a list of a notable author's works is also a good idea. However (and this is kind of the crux of my argument), the information still has to be verifiable , so unless and until somebody improves the list by citing each work to a reliable source , we should not have it. Compare and contrast with List of Hammond organs - note how every single entry is sourced. Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 11:56, 15 August 2013 (UTC) A part of his bibliography is verifiable by this reliable source ( Dawn ). I'm sure it is possible to find out more. -- Vejvančický ( talk / contribs ) 13:48, 15 August 2013 (UTC) That partially addresses the verifiability issue, but I'm not sure it addresses the issue of being an inappropriate content fork. The current revision of Humayun Azad is 17,885 bytes, of which 5527 (824 words) is prose. As a general rule of thumb , you probably want to be looking an article size of at least double that to think about having a bibliography as a content fork. To give a comparable example, Salman Rushdie is on 55K, has several content splits, but his bibliography is not one of them and listed in the main article. Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 14:17, 15 August 2013 (UTC) How can be a list of works of a notable writer inappropriate content fork? The bibliography could be redirected and merged to Humayun Azad but we should not delete it. Btw, I know that the recent AfD noms regarding Humayun Azad are affected by this ANI thread . -- Vejvančický ( talk / contribs ) 14:55, 15 August 2013 (UTC) Generally, I feel a merge / redirect is only appropriate if you think somebody's likely to type the name into the search box, and I tend to find "'x' bibliography", "'x' discography" or "list of 'x'" works aren't. And I'd say the same regardless of who's appeared on ANI recently, as I made this identical argument before ( example 1 , example 2 ) regardless of who happened to create the article in the first place. I'll admit I was a bit harsh about saying "non-notable" when I probably actually meant "not currently verified". Let's see what other people have to say on the issue now. Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 15:12, 15 August 2013 (UTC)  Merge to author page. 1) if the books are notable is irrelevant, books don't need to pass notability to be included in a bibliography 2) The bibliography here is better, it's in table format with additional information. 3) I don't think the list is so long that it needs a separate bibliography.

There are just enough assertions of notability to where this can't be speedied, but in the end the guy just isn't notable enough for his own entry. After I trimmed down the article and found one actual non-primary and non-merchant source, I just wasn't able to find anything to show notability for him, at least not enough to warrant his own article. Tokyogirl79 (｡◕‿◕｡) 04:10, 15 August 2013 (UTC) Keep . Here is a second reliable secondary source, which means he scrapes in on WP:GNG . St Anselm ( talk ) 05:20, 15 August 2013 (UTC) We need more than two news articles to show notability. The only time that 1-2 or even 3-4 sources will be enough would be if they were asserting something so overwhelmingly notable (such as him winning a Dove Award) that the article would be kept on that basis alone. The problem here is that the the third source on the article is a WP:PRIMARY source written by Cruise or by someone he paid to write it for him. I'm also somewhat worried about the Baptist Press source, as you'd have to prove that Cruise isn't a member of the Southern Baptist Convention. If he's a part of that group then the source would be considered more of a primary source than anything else. Tokyogirl79 (｡◕‿◕｡) 04:09, 16 August 2013 (UTC) Delete - reliable journalistic coverage seems thin on the ground, basically comprising of the article in Baptist Press which is partically devoted to him. I can't find any relaible reviews of any of his books either. Sionk ( talk ) 20:32, 15 August 2013 (UTC) Comment : Yup, he's affiliated with the SBC. This article remarks that one of Cruise's books was published by "BH Publishing Group, the trade books division of LifeWay Christian Resources of the Southern Baptist Convention". Since Baptist Press is the official paper of the SBC, that means that any article they write about him would be considered a primary source since it's in their best interest to write about him since they are publishing his product. So we're pretty much left with just one source, which isn't enough for notability. Tokyogirl79 (｡◕‿◕｡) 04:17, 16 August 2013 (UTC) Comment He has a quote in the New York Times , reprinted from the Joelton Journal. Citation: Emily Yellin, "Joelton Journal: An Evangelical Group for Hunters" , March 23, 2000. Last couple paragraphs. Another source: "BRIEF: Church blesses the annual hunt", Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal (Tupelo, MS), Nov 14, 2009, Quote: "The church will have a 'turkey shoot' Saturday night. Sunday is 'camo day.' This year's guest speaker is Jason Cruise, a Franklin, Tenn., resident and founder of the Outdoor Ministry Network which works with the Tennessee Baptist Convention to teach pastors and others how to reach men who love to hunt and fish." (From database: Newspaper Source Plus, EBSCOHost). With the The Tennessean it points to some notability as an evangelical Christian sportsman (hunter). These are brief but reliable, a couple more sources I'd vote keep. -- Green Cardamom ( talk ) 17:54, 16 August 2013 (UTC) Relisted to generate a more thorough discussion so a clearer consensus may be reached.

Worldcat shows of the two books he wrote, one is in 19 libraries, and the other in 22. 'DGG (at NYPL) ( talk ) 20:54, 21 August 2013 (UTC) Comment : The problem with the quote at the NYT source is that quotes aren't considered to be something that could show notability since most of the time they're getting quoted on something else and aren't the subject of the article in question. They've always been considered trivial sources for as long as I've been here, as someone can get quoted a hundred times yet never get any actual in-depth coverage. It means that he might be considered a reliable source on Christian/Evengelical hunters, but that's not something that gives notability.
