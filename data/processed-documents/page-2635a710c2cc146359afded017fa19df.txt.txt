Irrepressible Nunsense The Cove Journal (review) by JoDee Samuelson A new bridge is being built in the Cove this summer. What with the noise of jackhammers, compressors, and dump trucks coming and going, not to mention detoured traffic streaming down our usually quiet road, life seems a bit hectic. Let’s slip away for the afternoon and have a good laugh. Destination: Summerside, home of free parking, ball tournaments, W read more... Improv Improves The Popalopalots Review by Luke Arbuckle So, you take seven funny guys, give them a drink or two (if they want one) and put them on the main stage at The Guild in Charlottetown. No script, no rehearsal, no rules. Yes it’s random, yes it’s foolish, and yes, it’s completely, utterly hilarious. The Popalopalots (no, I don’t know where the name came from, but I can only imagine) are, Brenton Hartley, C read more... Quick Bright Things A Midsummer Night’s Dream Review by Sean McQuaid First and foremost, ACT’s new production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream is funny. In fact, it’s the second-funniest Shakespeare this reviewer has seen in recent memory, surpassed only by Joss Whedon’s delightful film version of Much Ado About Nothing – which made ye olde reviewer laugh harder and longer than he has in ages at anything, Shakespearean or otherwise read more... 2nd Island Fringe Festival Aug 29 to 31 Charlottetown When the idea of a Fringe Festival was introduced last year, many people weren’t quite sure what to make of it. Theatre performed in unusual settings—or even specifically written for an unusual setting? The idea seemed a bit off-the-wall. But Island Fringe 2012 changed all that. It attracted and delighted large audiences and has inspired a number of Island playwrights, actors and read more... The Light Within Profile: Julia Sauvé by Jane Ledwell Julia Sauvé has a “glow” about her, and it lights up in black light. The dancer, choreographer, and teacher is founder of Luminosity Black Light Theatre, the only black light performing company in the Maritimes. Julia is working with a cast ranging in ages from 10 to 16 to create The Mermaid and the Droplets at The Guild. “With black light, you have a lot in your i read more... The Waves Our Stories Leave The legacy of Erskine Smith by Graham Lea The show is over. Audience and actors have left. Costumes are hung and props reset. I turn out the backstage lights and pull tight the backstage door. The Playhouse is quiet. After a busy production week we have just finished the first few days of Having Hope at Home. Outside the heavy air is silent save someone sliding open a screen window and frogs chirping read more... Small Town Secrets You Can’t Get There From Here Review by Chris McGarry On July 3 a small though energetic crowd laughed their way through Pat Cook’s You Can’t Get There From Here, which debuted on the stage of the King’s Playhouse in Georgetown. In this delightfully comedic romp, the audience finds themselves in the dull, backwards town of Shadow Falls. Arthur (Tristan Lewis), a big-city news reporter with a big-city read more... I'm a Fan Dear Johnny Deere Review by Ann Thurlow I am a huge Fred Eaglesmith fan. And one of the very best things about Dear Johnny Deere, this summer’s offering at The Mack, is that others will get a chance to learn about his music, too. Prolific, but oddly obscure, Eaglesmith is a singular voice and a real Canadian treasure. So it’s great (after years of taking some heat for showcasing non-Canadian music) to read more...
