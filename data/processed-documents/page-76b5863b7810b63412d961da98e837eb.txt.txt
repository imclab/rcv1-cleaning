There were five stages a projection tent and a kids village situated in the Casino and Rose Garden grounds of the park. On the hill we slide down in winter and on which we enjoy Shakespeare In The Park during the mid summer nights, the sounds of talented local bands reverberated through the air. Vendors painted faces, displayed and offered for sale photographs, paintings, unique jewelry and wild clothes. Buffalo Jugglers demonstrated their skills. When hunger struck there were pulled pork sandwiches, tacos, pizza and liquid refreshment for children and adults alike. It carried on into the night.
