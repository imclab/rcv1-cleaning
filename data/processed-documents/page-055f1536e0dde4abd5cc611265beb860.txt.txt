If you're an auto enthusiast, you've probably spent countless hours and thousands (if not tens of thousands) of dollars trying to improve the performance and appearance of your car.

These customizations cover everything from tinting and unique paint jobs, suspension or engine upgrades to custom mufflers and high-powered stereo systems. Some car owners dabble in each one of these areas, while others just focus on one; either an awesome stereo or a lowered suspension.
