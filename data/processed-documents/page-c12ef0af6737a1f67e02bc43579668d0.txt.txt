What are the differences between  buying a used auto with an extended warranty and a certified used auto? As the popularity  of “certified used" and pre-owned vehicles has grown, so has the confusion surrounding  exactly what the dealerships are offering consumers. While hearing that a vehicle  has a “warranty” or is “certified” might help convince you to buy it, the details  can often be misinterpreted and can lead to unexpected expenses after the vehicle  is purchased.   For many dealerships “certified used” or “certified pre-owned” vehicles feature  warranties that extend beyond the initial coverage of the new auto purchase and  are recognized by the original vehicle manufacturer  view manufacturer’s programs . Before an auto can receive this distinction,  the manufacturer conducts what is known as a 100-point inspection, to determine  if the vehicle is worth the additional warranty coverage. If the vehicle passes  inspection the manufacturer authorizes the “certified” classification and the additional  warranty will take effect after the original coverage expires. Often, “certified”  buyers enjoy many of the same benefits new auto buyers receive.   Used vehicles that are sold with extended warranties are not factory-certified but  have service contracts that were purchased at an additional cost from a third party.  Most extended service contracts do not require manufacturer’s inspection and repair  procedures performed routinely under an authorized “certified” program.   Generally, autos with a “certified” authorization are more expensive than regular  “used” vehicles. However, the additional cost is seen as assurance from the dealer  that the auto is a solid purchase.    |   CPO Program Comparison  Dealer Directory Locate a local CUDL dealer Category Select a Category All Autos Boats Commercial Vehicles Motorcycles Personal Watercraft Powersports RVs and Trailers Make Select a Make Your Zip Distance 10 Miles 25 Miles 50 Miles 100 Miles 250 Miles Nationwide    Certified Pre-Owned  Manufacturer's Certified Program List Acura GMC Lincoln Porsche Aston Martin Honda Lotus* Rolls-Royce* Audi HUMMER Maserati Saab Bentley Hyundai Mazda Saturn BMW Infiniti Mercedes-Benz Scion Buick Isuzu* Mercury Subaru Cadillac Jaguar MINI Suzuki Chevrolet Jeep Mitsubishi Toyota Chrysler Kia Nissan Volkswagen Dodge Lamborghini* Oldsmobile Volvo Ferrari Land Rover Panoz* Ford Lexus Pontiac * These manufacturers do not offer a certified used vehicle program at this time.
