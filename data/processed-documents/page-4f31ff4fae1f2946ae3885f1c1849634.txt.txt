Credit: Zimbio.com Beyonce made headlines again this week and it wasn't more speculation about whether she's pregnant. During a concert in Copenhagen, Denmark, a fan was a bit too "hand" happy and used one to smack Beyonce's rear while on stage. I know, right? I, too, gasped in disbelief. A woman suggested that next time Beyonce hit him on the head with her mic. That would've been very funny, but may have worsened the situation. One man commentedthat it was Beyonce's fault because she was dressed too provocatively. This started a heated debate. Some women agreed. Others didn't. But, that's not what I want to discuss. Beyonce didn'texpect a man in the crowd to swat her butt while on stage. This is why her reaction -- or non-reaction -- was impressive. She didn't lose her cool and yell. She simply told him, "I will have you escorted out right now, all right?" Then, it was on with the show. And, at intermission, the hand happy man was tossed out. Watch the video; She didn't miss a beat. After reading the story, I recognized Beyonce set a great example about not reacting. I also found this scenario relevant to relationships. I tell my single clients to post a profile on Match.com andhit the speed-dating events if they want to meet men. Occasionally, they run into an ill-mannered man. He might ask a variety of ridiculous questions such as "Are your boobs real?" or "How do you feel about being 40 and never being married?" or "Do you rent or own your home?" Instead of throwing her drink in his face or telling him where he can go, I advise her to try not to react. Clearly the man is obnoxious and intentionally being offensive. But, it's important she understand the art of not reacting. Notice I didn't say "over-reacting." In essence, not reacting at all. Show a rude man that he's so utterly without consequence that he isn't worth your energy. This isn't always easy and you won't be perfect. The point is that not all men are worth your reaction. It's for you to decide which are. Look at it as practice so that you don't react to your boyfriend or husband's bad mood when he's grumpy after a bad day. Until next time... Shine like Platinum !
