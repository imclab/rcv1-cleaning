Chrysler Changing Corporate Culture To Boost Quality  By Richard Read 3  1,971 views Nov 19, 2009 Follow Richard  Add to circle Doug Betts  No matter how you feel about Senator McCain's statements from earlier this week , there's no denying that Chrysler has a lot of potholes dodge as it motors down the road to recovery. Among the biggest tasks at the top of the Chrysler's to-do list is cranking out vehicles of consistent quality. Doug Betts, the company's senior vice president in charge of quality, says that many past problems have been the result of Chrysler's inefficient and unresponsive corporate culture. However, Betts insists that Chrysler's restructuring and its new partnership with Fiat have put quality back in the spotlight. (That may sound slightly ironic to American ears, given our running "Fix it again, Tony" joke.) Among the company's more notablye changes is the re-organization of its quality teams, which are no longer grouped around specific vehicles, but rather around areas of expertise like brakes. Detroit News has an interview with Betts that offers a lot of additional detail. Whether you're a Chrysler fan or foe, it's a very interesting read.

I don't think anyone is cheering for them to fail, it's just that given the history, I don't see how they will improve significantly. Changing (improving)corporate culture is one of the hardest things a company can do. Props to Chrysler for identifying a serious issue and trying to address it. Hopefully they've installed some good consultants that will stick around and implement their recommendations. The problem is that bad company culture is like a metastasizing cancer--you practically have to kill the patient to heal them.   Post Reply     Vote  Bad stuff?  Have an opinion?
