Our Volswagen soft top supply and fit prices include all cables required and, of course, all materials are to the original quality. We can even carry full restoration of the hood and frame on the original Volkswagen Beetle cabriolet. This is a very involved job and we need to inspect the vehicle beforehand to establish the amount of work required, however, we have been working on VW Beetles for over 20 years so the quality of the finished job is assured. The Volkswagen Beetle convertible is where it all started for the Car Hood Warehouse just over 20 years ago. In those days over 90% of our work consisted of the 1302, 1303 and the Karmann Ghia models. We are therefore, extremely experienced in the full restoration of the frames, hoods and headliners on all Volkswagen convertible cars. Please contact us for further details on these models.

He was friendly, helpful, answered all the questions I had and was a credit to your business. The whole process, from booking the appointment (through a helpful lady in the office), to the actual fitting was very positive. Its great that my car now looks like new and no longer leaks!
