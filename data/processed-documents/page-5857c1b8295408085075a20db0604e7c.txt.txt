By James Yates/Staten Island Advance Staten Island Advance on July 31, 2008 at 1:00 AM, updated July 31, 2008 at 8:50 AM Print View/Post Comments This week's cover of AWE. Soul Joel Richardson is bringing organized comedy back to S.I. Fifteen minutes before the clock strikes showtime!, "Soul Joel" Richardson paces something fierce. He's chugging water, talking to himself and fielding last-minute questions from the half-dozen comics he has lined up for the night. His mind is racing. Each comic needs a clever intro and asks that certain credits get plugged. Plus, it's up to Soul Joel to warm up the cold crowd. These days, the producer of the inaugural Staten Island Comedy Festival, Aug. 4-7, has a ferryload to remember. But the so-called Forgotten Borough's funniest people are worth it, he says. "This will kind of bring recognition to some of the comedians coming out of Staten Island and performing all over the city," says Joel, a 2002 (bachelor's) and 2007 (master's) alum of Wagner College, who settled in Greenridge, after moving here from Moorestown, N.J. Comedy has arguably been a lost art form on S.I. for years. Circles West Supper and Comedy Club in Travis doubled as a restaurant and comedy house for about seven years, but folded last year. The well-known Grampa's Comedy Club in New Dorp closed in the late '90s. Now, there is no space dedicated exclusively to laugh-makers. The comedy fest is the first on this scale for S.I., says Soul Joel, who produces 11 regular comedy showcases in the metro area. John Szeluga This one drops in four spots, with a fresh lineup every night. National headliners Kenny Michaels and Otto & George from XM Satellite Radio's "Opie & Anthony Show," Don Jamieson from Comedy Central's "Crank Yankers," XM Radio's Mike Gaffney, the Dog and Pony Show (DAPS) comedy collective and Soul Joel bring down the finale's curtain Aug. 7 at 8 p.m. in the St. George Theatre. The fest launches Aug. 4 in Stapleton's 13th Hour Pub with S.I. talents John Szeluga, Nanci Richards and JP Justice, plus two winners of an amateur funnies contest. It continues Aug. 5 in Port Richmond's Dugout Pub with Island wiseguys Mary Dimino, Joe Lecesse, a local sketch group called Brando and DAPS. Jimmy Q, who hosts "Mayhem and Madness" at The Limerick House in Manhattan on Thursday nights, headlines. JP Justice The fest hits Illusions in Great Kills Aug. 6 with Craig Loydgren, an opener from The Killers of Comedy Tour, and Rossville's Vic DiBitetto. Plus Soul Joel takes the mic himself. All shows Aug. 4-6 are at 9 p.m. Admission is $10 for the first three nights and $30-$45 for the finale. "It's cool being part of an event that brings NYC-grade comedy to the Island," says Andrew Sotiriou, 24, of the DAPS, a sprawling crew of 20-something Web comics who mix things up at live shows. "It's always our focus here at DAPS to constantly improve what we do by collaborating with other talented people in the area." Mary Dimino Local talents say it's time comedy got some respect again. "There was a long time where people saw comedy as an art form," says Richards, who bases a lot of her act on her "double life" as a high school history teacher and as a stand-up. But maybe not so much these days. "It is a legitimate art. We're promoting it just like the other arts on Staten Island." For Otto, the human half of the ventriloquist team of Otto & George, gigging in the St. George Theatre, is a homecoming of sorts. The Keyport, N.J., man moved to South Beach as an infant, and spent most of his childhood here. Nanci Richards "I used to play hooky from school and see movies at the St. George when it was a movie palace, so it's kind of thrilling to be there," says the comic known for his ultra-blue act. Otto is a fan fave on S.I. and just might be an inspiration for others in the field, says Joel. Sure Otto has been featured in the "Dirtiest Dozen" DVD series, but he's been performing on street corners and on the Staten Island Ferry, earning a living, since he was a kid. "It's not just telling jokes in front of your friends, comedy can be a real profession," says Joel, who hosts a weekly Thursday night comedy showcase at Port Richmond's Dugout Pub. "I want to showcase where comedy can bring you." TALK BACK: Contact AWE senior writer Jodi Lee Reifer at reifer@siadvance.com.

It seems S.I. is always the butt of outer-borough jokes. To even the playing field, this time we asked comics on the bill why the joke is on us: Mary Dimino: The toll. Friends who don't live on Staten Island always say, "$10? That's a price of a movie." So my friends are always like, "Should we see 'Batman'? Should we see Mary? And 'Batman' always wins." Carlo Montagnino of the DAPS: The funniest part of Staten Island is the attitude. Hate everything, question why we are hated, complain, repeat ... it's like my girlfriend, only much, much more orange. JP Justice: One minute you can be in a nice tranquil oasis -- and then you turn the corner and it can be every bit of hell that you ever read about. Cops don't even come to certain blocks to help people. Nanci Richards: The funniest thing about living on Staten Island is we have more parking than any other borough -- but would kill our neighbor if he took our parking spot. John Szeluga: Listening to the borough president try to say "Woodrow Road" sounds like Elmer Fudd after a stroke. Soul Joel Richardson: Staten Islanders go to grammar school, but yet they still put the subject at the end of a sentence. If people are at a party or a restaurant they won't say the food is good, they'll say, "It's good, the food."  View/Post Comments  Copyright 2013 SILive.com. All rights reserved.
