  Autocross/Solo II Autocross is an extremely inexpensive and safe way toparticipate in competitive motorsports.In general, any safe,street legal vehicle can compete without anysignificant modifications(although heavily modified vehicles maybe at a disadvantage due to the rules structure-- a heavily prepared, supercharged drag raceris unlikely to make a good and competitive autocross car.) Autocross and Solo II events are "Time Trial" style competitions;there is no wheel to wheel racing involved,as cars are sent out one at a time,or at least spaced out so that they should not comeinto any contact with each other.These events are derived from the original Gymkhana competitionsfrom 50s and 60s.Today, an event called a Gymkhana is usually a "fun" event,with slow speeds and silly tricks.An event called an Autocross or Solo II is usually a seriouscompetition, with speeds perhaps as much as 70mph in large lotsor on airport runways. In general, a course is laid out using traffic cones;time penalties will charged for disturbing cones.For most clubs the penalty is 2 seconds per cone,although for some it may be 1 second.
