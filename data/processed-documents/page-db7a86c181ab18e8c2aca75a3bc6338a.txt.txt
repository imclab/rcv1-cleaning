If you need to find space for contemplation, might we suggest heading to Texas Womans Universitys new exhibition, Contemplation: Emerging Female Photographers from Japan. As the curators put it, Photographs depict no... Read more about this event  Dallas Cityscape  Galleria Our citys skyline is modest by big city standards  a concentrated cluster, for sure, but it packs an iconic punch. Theres no mistaking that youre home when you see Reunion Towers big glowing ball or the stately lights of the Arts District  its a silhouette that comforts and even inspires a certain level of pride, despite the showiness and the... Read more about this event  Hotel Texas: An Art Exhibition for the President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy  Dallas Museum of Art Dallas started gearing up for the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedys assassination a year ago, and it will be interesting to see how much revision and hand-wringing goes into Novembers festivities. On a more interesting note, the Dallas Museum of Art (1717 N. Harwood St.) is presenting Hotel Texas: An Art Exhibition for the President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy, a... Read more about this event  Erik Barnes  The Library Bar The Library Bar sits on the ground floor of the historic Warwick Melrose Hotel in the Oak Lawn area, not far from downtown Dallas. Designated a Dallas Historic Landmark in 1983, the original apartment hotel was built in 1924. The Library Bar offers patrons a relaxing, dimly lit piano-bar environment in a laid-back library setting -- though at night, it's far too dark in The Library Bar to...

Its time to celebrate the birth of Krishna, everyones favorite eighth incarnation of the Vedic supreme being Vishnu.

Read more about this event  Natasha Bowdoin: In the Garden  Talley Dunn Gallery Nature and a good book: If youve got those, youve got everything. Such fundamentals are the basis of Talley Dunns newest, Natasha Bowdoin: In the Garden, which opens from 6 to 8 p.m. Saturday. Bowdoin has two new projects to flaunt: Book of Nature, which interprets Emersons writings through cut paper and hand-written text, and Flowers for Henry, a look at... Read more about this event  Norman Rockwell and the Art of Scouting National Scouting Museum Norman Rockwell and the Boy Scouts of America are often underestimated these days. Rockwell is often looked upon as little more than a talented illustrator whos given too many unimaginative home decorators an easy out for folksy Americana options, while it seems as though todays grade-schoolers are only into smartphones and PSPs, not merit badges that boast the ability to... Read more about this event  DJitis Collective  Mable Peabody's First opened in 1979, Mable Peabody's Beauty Parlor and Chainsaw Repair served as a watering hole for Denton's gay and lesbian community. That is, until March 2007, when an arsonist, using the bar's own liquor to set the nightclub ablaze, torched the original Mable Peabody's. In the fall of 2008, owner Kelly Sanders reopened the bar just a block or so from the original spot. The new location...

Stephen Lapthisophon is a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington and University of Texas at Dallas, had multiple shows this summer, including one in Los Angeles, and he showed up in the Dallas Observers 2013 People Issue. Still unimpressed? Fine. Hes got a solo... Read more about this event  The Tickets Fight Night  The Village Country Club One notch above Jell-O wrestling youll find The Tickets Fight Night. Its a night when a bunch of regular jackoffs (and jackoff-ettes) step in the ring, stop fighting with their words and use their fists ... the way it was intended. After the fights, country singer William Clark Green will perform a concert, so pack up that straw cowboy hat because we know youve got...
