If the jokes this Saturday afternoon at Gotham Comedy Club seem kind of skinny, there’s a good reason. The theme of their show – “Food and Laughter is the Best Medicine,” hosted by “Late Show with David Letterman” warm-up comedian Eddie Brill – is all about losing weight and learning to eat healthier for a big cause: fighting heart disease, cancer and diabetes. All of which are close to the 54-year-old funnyman and former two-pack a day smoker who once tipped the scales at nearly 400 pounds.

(James Keivom/New York Daily News) “Weight was a constant struggle for me my whole life and I was always going up and down,” says Brill, a Brooklyn native who first became a fixture on the local club circuit in the early ’80s shortly after graduating from Boston’s Emerson College. Long plagued by sleep apnea, rosacea and joint ailments, Brill says he received his first wake-up call two years ago when his best friend from college was admitted to the hospital with heart problems and his close pal, Mets pitcher José Lima, died of a massive heart attack all within a matter of days. Then another alarm bell went off less than a week later when he was attending a Broadway performance of “Promises, Promises” and could barely fit into his seat.

(James Keivom/New York Daily News) But fortunately, he also made a promise to himself, and after shedding 135 pounds and becoming a vegan, Brill now has a serious message for his fellow cutups and comedy fans: you don’t have to be fat to be funny and standup sounds better with a shot of wheatgrass. It’s apparently beginning to catch on too, considering the positive response his show has gotten since doing it last year in Washington and at The Comedy Store in Santa Monica. Brill also didn’t have trouble convincing the performers on Saturday’s bill either, including Colin Quinn, Myq Kaplan and Jamie Kilstein.

(James Keivom/New York Daily News) “It’s a great way to start the new year off,” says Quinn. “Especially, since it’s happening on day five and I’m already saying, ‘F*** my resolutions.’ Doing this show will help keep me motivated.” Adds vegan comic Kaplan: “It’s going to be a lot of fun to be in the same room with like-minded people and see what their responses are.” “And,” agrees Kilstein, “I think you can use comedy for things that are better than simply making fun of people like you see at a lot of these club shows. Comedy is about challenging beliefs and putting out thought-provoking ideas, so anytime I get a chance to do that I’m happy.” Scott Gries Each comic is either a vegan or has dealt with health issues. The show also features presentations by Dr. Mitch Ghen of the Hypocrites Health Institute and Michael Bergonzi of the Raw Food Institute and Wellness Center, in addition to food tastings by local vendors like Reboot with Rebecca and Sundrops Organics. Brill says the reason he did “Food and Laughter,” which he plans to take to London in the spring, was to get people to think differently about nutrition. “Losing weight is not as hard as being healthy,” he says. “It’s all about having the right attitude and that’s what I want to convey. I guarantee people will leave feeling healthier than when they came in.” Post a Comment   Comments See All Comments [ Discussion Guidelines   ] To post your comments, please, Sign in    .
