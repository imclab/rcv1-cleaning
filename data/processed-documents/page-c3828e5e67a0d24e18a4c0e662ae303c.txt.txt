  2010 Nissan Altima Coupe vs 2010 Honda Accord Coupe November 2009 AUTORIVALS.NET Share  The Nissan Altima Coupe was recently refreshed along with its sedan counterpart but the changes are minimal. The Accord is bound to see a refresh in the next year or two but looks just fine as it is now. Both are quite handsome and theyre designs are ahead of their competition. 2010 Nissan Altima Coupe vs 2010 Honda Accord Coupe  The designs fall into two different categories. The Altima applies curves and rounded shapes throughout while the Accord is more angular and chiseled. It depends on your preference of which is better looking but the Altimas front fascia might appeal to less (which the sale numbers also indicate). It looks better than before but only by a small margin. The Accord has a stronger character with nicely sculpted lines, especially the fog light area.  Honda is one of the only major manufacturers where they design their hood differently. Rather than being the typical square shape like the Altima, the Accords hood actually runs diagonally from the A-pillar toward the grill. It eliminates excess lines and creates a great look for the fenders. The overall look is sleek and aggressive. Some people call the Altima a baby G35 (or G37). The similarity can be seen most in the profile and the shape of the C-pillar. The Altima keeps the side free of any character lines. The Accords profile seems reversed with a flat front and angled rear. It also looks excessively long (its 8 inches longer than the Altima) with large rear side windows and long overhangs.  The Altima brings a more interesting shape to the coupe form. The trunk lid is bent and flows angularly into the rear fenders. The rear look puts it ahead of the crowd. The Accord still looks elegant but theres nothing spectacular about it. Both the Altima and Accord score big in the rear end styling department. The Altima has a beautiful trunk silhouette and a unique rear bumper with a crevice for the license plate housing. The taillights are a bit oversized but look good with a simple red/white circular combination. The Accord is uncomplicated with everything falling together just right. The taillights, bumper, and trunk all match together admirably.  The Altimas interior can look too dark and drab compared to the Accord. The Accord uses two colors for its dashboard and doors giving it a more inviting interior compared to the Altimas all black interior. The Altima does have a better layout than the Accords center-bulge-button-overkill center stack. The triple circular vents in the Altima are reminiscent of the gauges in the 370Z.
