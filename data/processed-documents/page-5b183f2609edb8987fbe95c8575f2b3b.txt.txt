Home   Entertainment   Arts Arts Review 'Dixie's Tupperware Party' keeps humor surprisingly fresh Comedy at Marcus Center holds serious message By Mike Fischer , Special to the Journal Sentinel May 15, 2013 Tweet Email Print (0) Comments If you'd rank attending a Tupperware party alongside watching paint dry, you're in the same place I was upon being handed my obligatory nametag and a Tupperware catalogue when entering Vogel Hall for Tuesday's Milwaukee opening of Dixie's Tupperware Party. Well, hush my mouth. Ninety entertaining, intermission-free minutes later, I'd received a humbling reminder, courtesy of this funny show's serious, underlying message: Think outside the box - or bowl - containing one's preconceptions, and the world becomes a much more colorful place. That adjective certainly applies to the multicolored goods being hawked by Dixie Longate from the stage; Tupperware has come a long way from yesteryear's more limited offerings. But the true color in this show is supplied by Dixie herself - or himself, the cross-dressed Kris Andersson, sporting an auburn wig, baby-blue dress and killer heels. As Dixie demonstrates yet another Tupperware invention from a table piled high with them - while calling out product numbers for those audience members inclined to work on their conveniently provided purchase orders - she is mixing and matching sexual double entendres into an auctioneer's patter, delivered at dizzying, breakneck speed. The audience - including the incredibly good sports called onto stage and asked to play along with Dixie's antics - couldn't get enough of it, in a show rendered even funnier by how fully Andersson inhabits his trailer-park persona, presented with respect and largely without camp. But there's more going on here than Dixie's hard-cranking laugh-o-meter. While staking her claim on the fun to be had at what she insists is a real Tupperware party, Dixie takes the time to tell us what those parties mean, especially as we move ever further into the electronic netherworld she expressly condemns, where our shopping and our consuming are done online, furtively and alone. Tupperware parties, Dixie tells us (while asking us at one point to hold hands), reflect a time when we weren't afraid to come together, talk with and be touched by strangers, creating alternatives to the nuclear family in which we increasingly spend our time, while expanding our definition of who and how we might be. Giving us some Tupperware history, Dixie points out how important such communities once were to women - offering them a means of socializing and also working in the often grim 1950s, after the previous decade's riveting Rosies had been fired from the factories and sent home. Viewed from this angle, plastic - that much-maligned symbol of artifice - assumes new and more promising dimensions. For as Dixie reminds us, plastic - much like theater itself - also embodies our potential to continually refashion who we might be. Wearing new clothes. Forging new alliances. Learning, to one's joyful surprise, that a Tupperware party can be a blast. IF YOU GO Dixie's Tupperware Party continues through May 26 at Vogel Hall, 123 E.
