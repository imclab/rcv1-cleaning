The Daytime Entertainment Creative Arts Emmy Awards gala, which honors the crafts behind the many shows that grace the Daytime genre will return to the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles on Friday, June 14, 2013. These exciting nominations officially launch the 40th Anniversary of the Daytime Emmy Awards, said David Michaels, Senior Executive Director, Daytime. This will be a true celebration of the 40 years of Daytime Television focusing on the past, the present and the future of Daytime. Congratulations to all the nominees! This years Daytime Entertainment Emmy Award for Lifetime Achievement Award will be presented to two Game Show genre icons, Monty Hall and Bob Stewart. Aside from all of the excitement around our 40th anniversary, said Malachy Wienges, Chairman, NATAS, we are honoring two giants in Game Show history. So many of us grew up watching Monty Hall excite us with what was behind Door # 1, #2 or #3 and found ourselves addicted to the challenge and imagination of Bob Stewarts classic To Tell the Truth, Password Pyramid and others. The high-water mark these two pioneers have made in Daytime television is unparalleled and the entire Emmy Award community stands in appreciation for the immeasurable contribution they have made to the Game Show genre. The 40th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards is a presentation of the National Academy of Television Arts  Sciences in cooperation with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (ATAS). A breakdown of the awards by network, as compiled by the independent accounting firm of Lutz  Carr, LLP, follows.
