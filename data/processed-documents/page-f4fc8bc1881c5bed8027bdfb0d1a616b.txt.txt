Alien Jack-o-Lanterns! Free Pumpkin Carving Pattern Ideas Pages * Gallery Index, Browse All Picture Galleries * Halloween History and Christian Life Halloween, we hear, is now the third most popular "holiday" in the USA. Many Christians are very concerned about the meanings of Halloween customs, the seeming glorification and celebration of witches, ghosts and other spiritual beings, and the whole idea of having a holiday related to the dead. We're going to take a look at Halloween history, customs, the dead and the question of Christian involvement in the celebration. Be ready to be startled by some of the surprising things we've learned. What Is Halloween? The word comes an abbreviation of "All Hallows Eve." This is the night before All Hallows (All Saints) Day, when the Church honors the past (dead) Christians. All Saints Day is also known as the day Martin Luther nailed his protest of the Catholic Church and began the Protestant movement. There have been different dates for All Saints Day. It's commonly believed that November 1st was chosen to coincide with pagan celebrations and festivals in order to more easily assimilate these cultures into the Church, just like the dates for Easter and Christmas celebrations. It's this assimilation of festivals that makes Halloween a confusing holiday. Where Did Halloween Customs Come From? When All Saints Day and the pagan festivals were combined, the rituals and customs were also combined. Wearing costumes, ghosts, witches, carrying lighted ornaments to represent spirits, the whole trick-or-treat thing, harvest parties, etc. got combined over the centuries with what had been a somber event in the Christian calendar. Some of these rituals had been sacrifices to pagan gods before the pagans were Christianized. And there's the rub! Christians, who have no problem with the Christmas Tree or Easter Egg (pagan rituals), seem to draw the line when it comes to the Halloween pagan rituals and customs...particularly those involving the dead. What Does It Have To Do With The Dead? Actually, All Saints Day and Halloween share the idea of honoring the dead...they just differ on the methods. Many of the pagan rituals include tributes to the dead. That's probably why ghost costumes and tombstones have become Halloween classics. I don't understand the discomfort many Christians have with the idea of spirits being everywhere, or of spiritual life beyond physical death...it's the cornerstone of Christianity as taught in the Bible. Why would we be so frightened of what's on the other side of death? Many are so afraid, they keep their children from participating in the fun of Halloween. Should A Christian Refrain From Halloween Celebration? Once, early in my Christian walk, I believed it was a sin to have anything that had represented a belief in any power but God. I got rid of 4 leaf clovers, horseshoes, totem poles...symbols of pagan gods...so these things would have no power over me. After I grew a little in Christ and read the Bible a little more, It hit me...nothing has power over me because Christ is in me. In fact, by thinking these things had power, I was giving them the very power I opposed. It's the same with Christians and Halloween. Carving pumpkins, setting up witch statues, wearing ghost costumes, going to people's doors to collect treats...all of these rituals are mere games as long as we don't make anything more out of them. As a Christian, the most powerful being in all eternity lives within you. There is no power that can harm you. I'm not denying that evil spirits exist but when we Christians live in fear of them, we're giving them power they don't have. So, should Christians take part in Halloween? Yes...and no! If you believe it's a sin, pagan worship or anti-Christian in any way, you should refrain. Spend some time in Bible study and prayer to grow your faith until you have confidence that He who is in you is greater than all. If you've already reached that point in your spiritual growth, go have fun! Let your kids have fun, too! While you're at it, don't forget to teach your kids about All Saints Day and about the power of Jesus in them, protecting them from all harm...even from goblins. Webmasters comment: Increase In Spirit Activity, Influence From The Underworld and Evil Atmosphere. In the USA Halloween the last day of October, All Saints Day and Day of the Dead, Dia de los Muertos follow soon after at the beginning of November. The designer and webmaster of CrazyWebsite.com has celebrated (usually subtly) more than 50 Halloweens and the other mentioned holidays in many places and have never noted any real added influence from evil or the underworld and the only spirit increase I have noticed has been those from a bottle. I personally think people should relax and enjoy life, if celebrating Halloween or some of the customs associated with scares or concerns you some Christian Church near you probably offers some "Harvest Festival" as a healthy alternative for celebration so you won't get left out of the fun. There are many good Christians who can present a different opinion and support it with arguments and Bible quotes but none of the Halloween holiday entertainment humor and art work presented here is evil demonic and is presented free to you for your celebration of good and goodness; HAPPY HALLOWEEN!.

Top DVD Movies to Watch this Halloween: I love classic Disney animation if you do too then on Halloween or sometime during October you need to get a copy of " Mickey's House of Villains " to put you in the Halloween mood; it's a compilation of many Disney not scary horror shorts shown in a night club style show with many Disney characters on hand including all the infamous villains; Mickey Mouse himself is the Master of Ceremonies but is he safe in the same room as Disney's most evil villains? If you haven't seen it recently one movie that should be on everybody's Halloween movie lineup is " It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown " (G) this was released for TV from the Peanuts Gang in 1981 and has been broadcast Halloween time since. If you like the Simpsons you need to view a collection of the previous Halloween Specials: The Simpsons - Treehouse of Horror (TVPG); after this "must watch" Halloween time viewing there are thousands of weird and spooky movies that could be defined as essential Halloween time viewing and what is best is up to your mood and tastes. My personal favorite "monster movie" would be " Monsters, Inc. (G)" and I also enjoy old horror movies from Abbott & Costello and old classical horror favorites like " The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad " (G) taken from the "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" and "The Wind in the Willows". Another great macabre Halloween time animation is Tim Burtons The Nightmare Before Christmas as well as his Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition) . Since I lean towards the comedic and family oriented films towards the top my list of Halloween season movies has got to be " The Addams Family " (PG-13) and its sequel " The Addams Family / Addams Family Values " (PG-13) both of those are just so weird and wacky in a Halloweeny kind of way and " Young Frankenstein " is great too; or if you like hilarious musicals " Little Shop of Horrors " (PG-13) is very funny. If its real Horror genre that you crave for Halloween watching I would suggest " Bride of Re-Animator " (R), " The Howling IV: The Original Nightmare " (R), " Phantasm II " (R), and " Hellbound (withThe Hitman/Forced Vengeance) " staring Chuck Norris because I worked on these great horror movies. If it is graphic gritty blood, bondage, torture, gore, violence and shear terror you seek you can watch " The Passion of the Christ " which includes super natural phenomena and is based on a true story and may scare you out of hell. My favorite Halloween TV / DVD entertainment has to be the always much anticipated Simpsons Halloween Specials: The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror (TVPG) . If you like the Simpsons then you will love there Halloween Specials which have been hilarious short spoofs of famous scare flicks; these short horror-movie stories are filled with time travel, cannibalism, nightmare invaders, aliens and wizardry. #2 It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (G) This wonderful made for family TV Halloween Holiday Special was first released from the Peanuts Gang in 1966 and is a timeless Halloween classic that played on TV every years since; just to make sure you don't miss it can also be rented or purchased. I try to see it every year; there is great beauty in the animated shows simplicity and silliness; it reminds of pleasant times past when animations were artistic creations made painstakingly by hand and children could safely don costumes and roam the neighborhoods unsupervised collecting Halloween candy which was safe to eat without adult inspection. #3- Monsters, Inc. (G) ( review ) Top of my Halloween movie must watch movies and my favorite ever monster movie an animation made in 2002 by Pixar, Monsters, Inc., the studio's fourth feature film is rated G, insults nobody's inelegance and can be enjoyed by young and old alike. Every night, the professional scarers of Monsters, Inc., sneak into children's bedroom closets around the world, eliciting screams that they convert into the energy their world needs. Aside from a minor power shortage, life is just fine for top scarer James P. "Sulley" Sullivan (John Goodman) and his assistant, Mike (Billy Crystal) -- until a little girl named Boo accidentally finds her way into the monster world -- and into Sulley's heart. #3- Ghostbusters (Widescreen) (PG) A hilarious PG action / comedy spook film released in 1984 and sequeled in 1989, good for everyone but young children. The story is that after losing their academic posts, a team of parapsychologists (Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Harold Ramis) goes into business as "ghostbusters" -- exterminators of ghouls, hobgoblins and supernatural pests of all stripes. An ad campaign pays off when a knockout cellist (Sigourney Weaver) hires the squad to purge her digs of demons. Turns out the place has become an entryway for a legion of fiendish spirits bent on terrorizing the Big Apple. Ghostbusters Double Feature Gift Set (Ghostbusters/ Ghostbusters 2 and Commemorative Book) " The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad " (G) are two delightful early (1949) Disney animations based on classical stories. Not really Halloween fair but my fravorite of the two segments is "Mr. Toad"; it is a beautiful hand drawn animation based on the delightful book "The Wind in the Willows" by Kenneth Grahame; the characters have charming voices and the story is further supported by narrations form Basil Rathbone. The Halloween oriented segment of this DVD is "The Adventures of Ichabod," another early Disney animation, this one based on the story by Washington Irving, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow". The very scary infamous Headless Horseman is featured with Icabod in this film and interestingly none of the characters speak but the endearing Halloween tale is told using amusing musical tunes and narrations from legendary Bing Crosby. Igor [Blu-ray] (G) Animated horror-comedy tale with a cast full of wonderful colorful not so horrable cartoon charters staring in a fable about a hunchbacked evil scientist's assistant who aspires to become an evil scientist himself, much to the displeasure of the rest of the evil science community. His first attempt to create evil âlifeâ takes unexpected turns for the best and a delightful hilarious romp to nice ending. For the 25th anniversary release of this charming magic themed movie " Bedknobs and Broomsticks Enchanted Musical Edition " (G) it was restored and re-edited to better than original; and as if that wasn't enough to make great Halloween time viewing two wonderful classic sort of Halloween flavored Disney cartoons are included on the DVD, although not promoted they are in the bonus materials and are worth mentioning and viewing. "The Worm Turns," is a 1936 Disney short staring Mickey Mouse as a scientist, in his laboratory he creates a potion which can give a mouse the strength and confidence of a lion, using his formula Mickey turns the world as we know it on its ear, hilarious classic Disney color cartoon. Also along the same line in "The Vanishing Private," Donald Duck paints himself invisible with a newly developed camouflage paint upsetting the order of an Army Base in this wonderfully funny 1941 Disney Cartoon. The Raven (G) An all-star of classic horror movie actors are featured in this hilarious 1963 horror movie comedy spoof directed by Roger Corman. Peter Lorre is magician who has been turned into a raven that turns for help to a friend and former sorcerer (Vincent Price) for help dealing with a powerful out of control evil sorcerer Scarabus (Boris Karloff) in this film loosely based on the Edgar Allen Poe poem âThe Ravenâ and also stars a young debonair Jack Nicholson as Peter Lorreâs son. Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein This Abbott and Costello horror-comedy flick features the bumbling buddies as railroad baggage clerks who receive a strange shipment -- the last remains of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster. Trouble is they're still alive! When the deadly duo escape to a remote island, Abbott and Costello follow their trail and find not only the two ghouls, but also a mad scientist who wants to switch Costello's brain with that of Frankenstein's monster. Abbot & Costello meet more than Frankenstein's monster in this insane monster movie there is an all star cast including Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's Monster, Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula, Lon Cheney Jr. as Wolf Man and there is even more it is a regular monster mayhem, its a funny fiend fright fest not to be missed. Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy Classic vaudeville bits and hilarious physical gags will keep you laughing when Peter (Bud Abbott) and Freddie (Lou Costello) are pursued by an Egyptian cult for a special medallion linked to a walking mummy. Even funnier today this spoof on Mummy Movies makes for side-splitting Halloween time entertainment. Young Frankenstein ( review )(PG) Dr. Frankenstein's grandson, after years of living down the family reputation, inherits granddad's castle and repeats the experiments. One of Mel Brooks' best and most hilarious works, he both parodies and salutes the Frankenstein movies. Co-writer Gene Wilder soars as mad scientist Frederich Frankenstein, with hilarious support from Marty Feldman as Igor, Peter Boyle as the monster, Teri Garr, and the late, great Madeline Kahn. A wonderful Mel Brooks Frankenstien spoof shot in beautifuly in black and white 1979, very funny. You could make it a Mel Brooks double-header Halloween and also watch " Dracula - Dead and Loving It " (PG-13) it which is not too bad Halloween entertainment either. If you are looking for a movie you can view that will not scar small children for the rest of their lives " Arthur and the Invisibles (Widescreen) " (PG) might be the one; the evil lack of ethics bankers and bill collectors may scare you and me but they won't phase the children in this wonderful mix of animation (the world of the Minimoys is the animated portion of the movie) and real life film. It is the good guys that are featured in this enchanting movie the "monster" takes a back seat; yes there is a monster but he is so despicable that he is usually not called by name but is just referred to as "M"; any this is a wonderful beautifully done evil verses good move which the whole family can enjoy. Another family friendly option for safe non-scary Halloween entertainment could be the 1996 Francis Ford Coppola directed movie " Jack ," (PG-13) which starts on Halloween then takes and unsuspected direction; Robin Williams does an excellent job in the challenging role of the main character whose life in the fast lane has lessons for us all. The best family Halloween viewing option which includes the 3 to 7 year olds would be Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie ; it's filled with fun, important lessons for children, exciting adventure, unconditional friendship, and lots of laughter, Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie best for kids 3-7 but a sweet treat for the whole family.
