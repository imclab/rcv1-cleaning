CarMax store and carmax used cars are known for their no-haggle, one price selling method and buying used cars straight from consumers. The people over thereare fairly straight forward and they will buy your car at wholesale price! Many people experience the Carmax used cars store are paying higher than the Kelley Blue Book value, I personally have good experience working with them. Their catchy phrase "we'll buy your car even if you don't buy ours" sets a good example of reputable dealership: they offer you the SAME price whether you buy their cars or not. The reason they can be so straight forward about their pricing while most other dealers are not is very simple: get as many trade-ins as possible! More Trade-Ins Equals More Profits Did you know that each trade-in vehicle a dealer acquire will stand minimum of $200 dollars for wholesale piece to few thousands dollars retail. If you have vehicle that does not meet their retail parameter ie engine burning oil, transmission fluid leak (the repair cost is too high compare to profit margin) they simply take it to the auction or sold to wholesalers. Done! Many people are not aware that car dealers (new and used) are making far more money off your trade ins, they can retail for huge profit, or wholesale for smaller $$. Working in the dealership, i see people doing this all the time. Where they can sell their car privately for whole lot more than the dealer offers. Maybe some people just either don't know or don't have time or too lazy to do so. "Just want to sell my car to the dealer and get on with my life!" Well, If that's what you want, just drive it to a nearest store and let them conduct an Used Car Appraisal I highly recommend anyone to take their vehicle to your local carmax used cars store for a straight answer of your trade-in value, or simply just sell your car to them. They are friendly, they will work with you and take care of all the paper work even cut you a check on the spot! Buying Used Cars At Your Local Store If you are planning to buy cars, Carmax locations are all over the country, they are not bad place to shop, I estimated their average profit for each car is about $1,500 to $2,500. The sources of used cars are mostly customer trade-ins, fleet vehicle off-lease returns or ex-rental return vehicles. If you like to negotiate, they are not for you. If you have lots of time and like to shop around for the best deal, you won't like them much either. They are set up for people who don't mind pay a little higher but great quality late model used cars. Tips On Buying From CarMax Despite the fact with their good reputation and quality inventories, it doesn't hurt to have the car checked out on your own during the company's 5-day money-back return period. You should also get the vehicle identification number (VIN) of the car and run the Vehicle History Report against the odds. One word of caution if you are buying carmax used cars is that those folks are fast-paced, get in, test driving then the paper work and drive home. That's the way they set it up, some people are not comfortable with the way they do business. My advice is to do your research, really get to know what you want in a vehicle. Edmunds Website is a great place to learn about features and options of cars. And be prepared to make the decision while you are there. Nonetheless, I admire their business model and funny Carmax used cars commercial. You can go to Carmax Used Cars to locate a store nearest to you.
