For 2013, the Ford Mustang sees a few cosmetic changes and upgrades designed to ensure its continuing appeal for demanding drivers. While lacking the power of its V8 siblings, the two trim levels of the V6 deliver exceptional styling and raw power, going from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 5.6 seconds. Overall, this entry in the Ford Mustang stable lives up to the hype with solid performance and handling at a surprisingly affordable base sticker price. Under the hood The 2013 Ford Mustang V6 coupe is powered by a 3.7-liter V6 engine that produces 305 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Rear-wheel drive is designed to focus the Mustangs ample accelerating power and is paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Buyers can also opt for a six-speed select-shift automatic transmission; however, that would miss the point of this high-performance vehicle entirely. Fuel economy is good for the pony car category at 19 miles to the gallon in the city and 31 on the highway. Safety features include antilock brakes and stability control along with a full lineup of air bags. Inside the cabin The Ford Mustang V6 is nicely equipped with power accessories, air conditioning, keyless entry, and a basic four-speaker CD stereo system. Upgrading to the Premium trim level adds leather seating, an upgraded Shaker stereo system, and power-adjustable drivers seat. While the 2013 Ford Mustang can theoretically hold four people, the back seat is exceptionally small and suited mainly for small children and cargo. Added cargo space in the trunk makes this one of the more practical muscle cars on the market. On the road The 2013 Ford Mustang V6 coupe is a worthy contender in the pony car category with enough power to please even the most demanding performance car drivers and a number of thoughtful extras that ensure passenger comfort as well. In terms of value for money, the Ford Mustang V6 is in a class of its own. Conclusions With a remarkably low price tag and solid performance, the 2013 Ford Mustang V6 is the perfect way to experience the muscle car mystique. Aggressive exterior lines and outstanding power and acceleration ensure the continuing popularity of this prestige pony car for demanding drivers looking for added thrills behind the wheel.
