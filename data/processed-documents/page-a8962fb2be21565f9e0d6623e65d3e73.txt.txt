It is the dedication of Californians that make it the largest economy of the world’s most powerful country. Knowing the attitude of Californians, several lenders have trust in you. You may think that buying a car is difficult in this economy. But, the case is not so. There are ample opportunities with you to buy your dream car. The option of bad credit auto loan is one of them. This loan type is useful for those who are suffering from a poor credit score. There are many confused souls who do not understand bad credit score. Well, let’s make it simple for everyone. Bad credit is nothing but your credit score gone awry. A credit score basically means numerical representation of your credit worthiness. The most commonly used score model is FICO score. TransUnion, Equifax and Experian are three of the largest U.S repositories. They handle your credit scores. Every credit bureau has separate criteria for calculating your credit score. This is the reason a same individual has different credit scores at the same time. Generally, a score above 700 is considered excellent. If your credit score is below 500, it is usually a bad credit score. But, this doesn’t mean the doors of opportunity are closed on you. Lenders have their own criteria. Your credit score may be bad for someone and average for another lender. So, the bottom-line is that you shouldn’t stop searching. Remember a quitter never wins. Explore as many options as possible. All you need to do is search for lenders who offer affordable auto loans for bad credit. You can seek help from your local lenders or widen your search with the help of internet. Internet allows you to complete your loan process in a quick span. When you search online, make sure you choose a secured website for filling the application form ( https://www.rapidcarloans.net ). A valid security certificate means the site is safe from phishing. So, check the security of the site. The Down Payment There are several things that can affect your auto loan. How much amount you put in as down payment is also important. Down payment is the initial upfront amount that you pay while making a purchase. You can increase your loan approval chances by making a huge down payment. This will reduce the lender’s risk and will also ensure him of your financial capability. The Co-Signer Rule This is another way of raising the probability of approval. If you ask someone to co-sign your auto loan, the lender’s risk gets divided. If you have a co-signer, he guarantees the repayment of your loan. So, search for someone who trusts you and is ready to co-sign your loan agreement. What Documents Are Required For Your Bad Credit Auto Loan? Proof of Income If you are a salaried employee, then it is important that you send a copy of last two months’ pay stubs. For self-employed or individual contractor, pay checks are out of question. Hence, it is necessary that you submit your IT returns of at least three years. It will include:- 1. Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return) 2. Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business) 3. Schedule SE (Self-Employment Tax) Bank Statements Regular bank statements are a proof of your stable economic condition. Lenders want to ensure that their money is going into right hands and hence would be interested in understanding your personal accounts. Your Residential Proof A copy of your recent Mortgage Statement Utility Bill like phone or electricity is enough for lenders. Vehicle information You will also need to submit details of your car. A new car will require information like the purchase price, VIN, car’s year, make and model.
