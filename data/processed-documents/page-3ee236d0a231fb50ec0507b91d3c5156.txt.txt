It is the only reasonably-priced midsized convertiblewith realistic room for four full-sized adults available in the Americanmarket today. Although it replaces the venerable Le Baron convertible inChrysler's lineup, it is completely new. Designed from the ground up as aconvertible and only a convertible, it shares little besides the name withthe Sebring coupe. The Sebring convertible is based on the "JA" platformused by the Chrysler Cirrus, not the "FJ" platform of the Sebring coupe. Like the big domestic convertibles of the 1950s and 1960s, theSebring convertible is a distinctively American car for American driving.It is not a nostalgia trip but a fully modern car with a rigid unit-construction chassis, fully-independent suspension, modern safetyequipment, and a choice of economical four or six-cylinder engines. Twotrim levels, JX and JXi, are offered. Although the JXi is fully-equipped,most of its equipment is optionally available on the JX. I recently spent asunshine-blessed week with a Sebring JX equipped with almost all theoptions and found it to be a pleasant, enjoyable car with plenty of room forfour people and luggage. APPEARANCE: From the outside, the Sebring convertible is undeniablya Chrysler product. "Cab forward" design, practically a corporatetrademark, means short front and rear overhangs with the wheels movedout toward the corners of the car. The hood and rear deck are nearly thesame length, and both are short. The passenger cabin is very long. Thefront of the car is dominated by a black trapezoidal grille with a massivechromed horizontal bar that is reminiscent of the classic Chrysler 300series of the 1950s. From the side, the sloped hood, steeply rakedwindshield, and high rear deck help give a sporty appearance. Ovalwraparound taillights highlight the rear panel. COMFORT: The Chrysler Sebring convertible is the one open-top car thatcan be functional, practical family transportation. Cab-forward architecturemakes for plenty of room inside, especially in the back seat. This is a carthat can comfortably hold four full-sized people, or five in a pinch. Thereis real legroom for rear-seat passengers. The front bucket seats and rearbench of the JX are covered with "ultrahide" synthetic material as standardequipment. My test example had the optional premium cloth, a definiteplus for humid summer days. Because the front seat belts are anchored tothe seats, not the car body, rear seat access is very good for a 2-door car.The drivers'-side seat back returns to position after being moved forwardfor easier rear seat access. The instrument panel is a modern, flowingdesign that offers good visibility of the instruments and functionalpositioning of the controls. The glove box and console storage can belocked. Small details make the Sebring convertible noteworthy. Forinstance, the dome light is placed on the bottom of the rearview mirror, soit can be useful with the top up or down. The fully-lined, power-operatedtop has a heated glass backlight and can be put up or down at the touch ofa button. Two latches to the top of the windshield secure it. The power-operated windows should be down when raising or lowering the top; ifnot, they are partially lowered automatically. Trunk space is veryreasonable, especially for a convertible. SAFETY: The front seat belts and shoulder straps in the Sebringconvertible anchor to the front seats. Dual front airbags and frontal, side,and rear impact protection structures are standard. A personal securitysystem is optional on JX models and standard on the JXi, as are antilockbrakes. ROADABILITY: The Chrysler Sebring convertible is a cruiser, not asports car. The purpose-designed chassis provides a good anchor for afully-independent suspension. Chassis flex is minimal, ensuring aminimum of squeaks and rattles. A smooth ride is the goal more than out-and-out sports car cornering abilities. This is attained, and handling isperfectly good at touring speeds. The Sebring convertible is a relaxing,enjoyable car to drive, especially with the top down. The windshield andfront seat position make sure that top-down wind blast is not a majorproblem. There is enough breeze for the wind-in-the-hair experiencewithout excess. PERFORMANCE: As in handling, performance of the Sebring convertibleis biased toward the real world in 1996 America. With the 2.5-liter V6engine, low-speed acceleration is good enough for safe maneuveringaround town and in traffic. Power drops noticeably above 70 mph, but isjust fine at normal, real-world speeds. The Sebring convertible is no hemi-powered beast, but an enjoyable cruiser with room for friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: With the introduction of the Chrysler Sebringconvertible, the affordable family convertible is back. It combine style,comfort, and top-down fun in a unique package.
