I put in a request for a window regulator replacement for my Honda Pilot 2004 and it popped up a quote in seconds. I hate having to go around from shop to shop to get quotes. This really made the whole experience so much more convenient. Highly recommended." By Pervez S., Chandler, AZ "AutoMD's Insta-Quotes! takes a ton of the stress out of getting my finicky car fixed. The best part is how speedy it is  I don't have to wait hours or a whole day for a price estimate!" By Tam V., Chicago, IL "Being a woman who knows nothing about cars, going into a repair shop can be a scary experience. Using the diagnose and find a shop features on AutoMD, I felt confident talking to the mechanic about what I needed repaired and the labor costs I expected to pay based on his claims. AutoMD not only saved me time and money, but most important, it gave me peace of mind."
