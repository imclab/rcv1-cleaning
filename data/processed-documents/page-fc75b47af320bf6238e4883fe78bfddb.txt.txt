Through  September 15, 2013 No Exit is part of the Premiere Season of Next Stage, a truly unique and innovative theatre experience produced by The Flowertown Players and their New York trained neighbors at South of Broadway Theatre Company. This joint production raises the bar by blending both companies best attributes, setting a new precedent in Low Country theatrical collaboration.As a Theatre Charleston Award Nominee for Outstanding Director, Mark Gorman helms this four person tour de force, starring Flowertown Players Artistic Director JC Conway, South of Broadway Equity Actor Kristen Kos, and local talents Haydn Haring and Julie Hammond. Witness the genesis of his most well-known quote “Hell is other people.” Two women and one man are locked together in a room. The windows are bricked up; there are no mirrors; the electric lights can never be turned off; and did we mention it’s hot? Oh so hot. Confessions, threats, seductions. Salvation? Escape? No Exit.  Of its American premiere critic, Stark Young said, “It should be seen whether you like it or not.” Jean-Paul Sartre’s classic play of Existential angst opens the new partnership between South of Broadway and Flowertown Players: Next Stage.  You won’t want to miss this unique opportunity to witness this classic piece of theatre. For two weeks the show will be performed in-the-round at South of Broadway’s intimate 99 seat house. The action will literally be close enough to touch. After closing at South of Broadway on August 31, the cast and crew open just 4 days later at Flowertown Players classic proscenium 199 seat theater. Here the show will be given a bigger and more elaborate design.  How will this change of venue affect the show? Come out and see for yourself!

Through September 14, 2013 Village Repertory Co. presents Fallen Angels  Julia and Jane are the best of friends and happily married.  But before they tied the knot, they each had a brief, torrid affair with Maurice, a charming, handsome Frenchman. While their husbands are away for a day of golf, guess who’s back in town and requesting the ladies’ company?   FALLEN ANGELS is a champagne cocktail of wit, charm and high comedy that set the stage for such classic female comedic duos as Lucy and Ethel; Laverne and Shirley; Patsy and Edwina as well as inspiring current hit shows like “Sex and the City” and “Desperate Housewives.”   This is Noël Coward at his inimitable best, you’ll laugh yourself silly at the farcical foibles of these fabulous FALLEN ANGELS.
