Looks like theyre all good now, since they were hanging out last night at the 2 Chainz listening party at PrivÄĹ  Lounge in Atlanta. And it wasnt just the two men that surprised us. Traci Steele was also super friendly with Scrappys new boo, Basketball Wives L.A. star Bambi , despite our impression that the two women were not part of the same circle  not after Bambi appeared on the show amid Kirks lake house tryst. Check out the photos from the event to see Scrappy and Bambi get snuggly, and Traci and DJ Babey Drew getting close and making us want them to get back together.

Last night on Basketball Wives , Tami and Suzie did a little recon work to find out what they could about Tasha Marbury . (Not all that hard considering her life is regularly documented on TMZ and, inadvertently, in Evelyn Lozada s book.) But when Tami suggested that Suzie bring up the question of whether or not Tashas husband really did have a fling with their chef, fans of the show criticized Suzie for letting herself be manipulated by Tami. On our Very VH1 live chat with Suzie, she defended herself and explained that she definitely didnt get played.

Clearly he gets some of it from his parents, the actual king and queen of hustle, T.I. and Tiny Harris , but hes also just got a natural charm we adore. In this series of photos taken from his birthday party which was held over the weekend, hes holding down the festivities, whether hes posing with his parents, his girlfriend (yes!), or various exotic animals. Check out our top ten faves of King ruling the roost.

Class size: just one. Tasha Marbury was finally introduced to the women, and thanks in part to Evelyn s book, Tami and Suzie had just enough background on Tasha, her husband and her chef to make things interesting. In last nights live tweets, read what the women had to say about the situation. (You can also hear a more detailed account of things from Suzie in our Very VH1 live chat.) And remember, no shoes allowed in the Champagne House.
