   current computer technology     Sunday, December 16, 2012 kudals: Arts And Entertainment: Humor Article Category ? HaaHaa ... What is life without humor and what can give more smiles to one's face than some funny and very funny jokes. But be careful to avoid laughing at your own career competence, as those around you want to see courage and confidence. For me, the piano is the symbol of what is stiff, proper and elegant. It doesn't have faults, it is perfect. Pianists are the most perfectionist people in the world. They should not and can not make mistakes especially when performing. That is how I viewed the piano and the pianists. But then, I just found out I was wrong. A few researches and I have once again proven that appearances can be deceiving. iframe width="400" height="300" src="http://youtube.com/embed/5S0vLDv5heA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen/iframe Most often, designer labels might cater to an immense range when it comes to styling range, but fall short while providing for the variety in terms of colours, sizes, and fabrics. However, a href="http://ebancuri.org"bancuri noi/a Clothing scores highly on this parameter too. Right from bold, quirky colours like magenta and purple to pastel shades, Humor has all the possible colour options you might seek. Whether it's informal T-Shirts, cardigans, sweaters, or shirts, you can always get the colour and size of your choice. The range is seemingly never ending. There was a time when instructions pertaining to safety used to be taught through the medium of books as well as pictures to the affect that the retention of knowledge was limited only to theoretical knowledge. This was replaced by motion picture wherein a video clip graphically demonstrating safety instructions as well as their repercussions on being neglected was more effective in creating awareness. Due to their impact, safety videos began to be made to encompass a wide variety of topics and were made available through the internet as well for easy and widespread accessibility. Hence, all that the viewer was required to do was to click on the relevant topic and then assimilate all the instructions and safety tips enumerated in it. Unfortunately, movie reviews say that this summer's movies were a disappointment. There was lots of money made ($4.35 billion) but few tickets sold - less than in the past ten years. Increases in ticket prices, particularly because 3D movies hiked up ticket prices, made up for the bigger bottom line. However, there weren't a lot of people who went out to the movies. img src="http://www.triggerandfreewheel.com/image/toil et-humor" alt="humor" width="400" height="300"/ Not along ago, about 35 million people got an e-mail containing a picture taken in Disneyland. It took a minute to see it but there was Donald Duck lying prone in front of the famous Cinderella Castle. The title of the picture was "Bird Flu has hit Disneyland". It was a viral e-mail advertising Disneyland and used the edgy strategy of making light of what's serious... and it works. With the advent of blogs, there are now weblogs which have the primary purpose of posting new jokes regularly. Blog readers often have the opportunity to comment on the jokes they find most funny and original. Make humor and laughter a mainstay in your life; you'll live on a higher plane. For me, the piano is the symbol of what is stiff, proper and elegant.
