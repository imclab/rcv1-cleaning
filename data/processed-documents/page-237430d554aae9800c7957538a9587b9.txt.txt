 Read This: How GMs grueling 24-hour test gets the kinks out of its performance cars August 27th, 2013 0 Comments  One of the biggest challenges automakers face when designing a high-performance car is making sure that it is both fast and reliable. For General Motors, any car that might be taken to the track by its owner  like the Corvette, Camaro Z/28 (shown above) and the Cadillac CTS-V, for example  undergoes a rigorous and strenuous 24-hour test by engineers at the Milford Proving Grounds, as pointed out by Car and Driver . Weve posted on this topic in the past  on a video showing the Camaro ZL1 being brutalized, for instance  but this article gives a more in-depth look at what actually happens behind the scenes including what that poor ZL1 went through. Though the test isnt for 24 hours straight, the cars are pushed as hard as possible by some of GMs best drivers with only the brakes and tires replaced frequently. We dont want to ruin the fun for you, but it is an interesting article that tells just some of what GM does to develop its sports cars. Check out the full article over at Car and Driver for the rest of the story. Official: 2014 Toyota Corolla priced from $16,800* August 27th, 2013 0 Comments  Well be publishing our First Drive of the 2014 Toyota Corolla later today, but right now, we can reveal that the eleventh-generation compact will be priced from $ 16,800 when it hits dealerships this fall (*not including a $ 810 destination charge). Four trim levels will be offered, and that sub-$ 17,000 price point reflects the base L grade with a six-speed manual transmission. Adding the four-speed automatic (yep) brings that price up to $ 17,400, which gets you the usual features standard on this class of car, including Bluetooth connectivity, eight airbags and  a first for this price point  LED headlamps. From there, the LE trim ($ 18,300) adds a backup camera, cruise control, keyless entry, Entune audio (including a 6.1-inch touchscreen) and a brand-new continuously variable transmission replacing the four-speed auto. Theres even an Eco version of the LE trim that uses a different engine tune to provide fuel economy of up to 42 miles per gallon on the highway. The top-trim S, pictured above, comes with a modified front fascia design, rear lip spoiler, leather-wrapped steering wheel, sport seats and more for $ 19,000. There are paddle shifters mated to the CVT with seven gears, and optional 17-inch wheels are available. Toyota will offer the S trim with a six-speed manual as part of the Plus package, and the Premium pack adds Softex synthetic leather seats. All in, a fully loaded Corolla comes in just under $ 24,000. Not bad, at all. Stay tuned for our full impressions of the new Corolla in just a few hours.

Slated for a worldwide debut in Germany next month at the Frankfurt Motor Show, this concept previews a new entry-level premium compact that Infiniti hopes will attract younger buyers to the brand, as well as give it a competitor in a burgeoning new class thats quickly filling up with options. What will set the Q30 apart? Aside from a bold and aggressive design that picks up where the new Q50 and many concepts have left off, Infiniti says the shape combines elements from three bodystyles, all of which appeal to the sort of buyer its hoping snare. Can you guess which three? No peeking at the press release down below. Give yourself ten arbitrary points if your answer was coupe, crossover and hatchback. Infiniti promises a ride height that will be high enough to earn crossover credentials, and were guessing its got an actual hatch back there, which leaves the coupe. Wheres the coupe in the Q30s design? The influence of a two-door is a little more difficult to see with the naked eye, but what the Q30 shares with some four-door coupes on the market is a roofline that peaks and begins to slope back down before the B-pillar and rear set of doors. Theres no information available yet on what powers the Q30 Concept, and hence even less about what will power the production version, but we expect to learn more more in the coming weeks leading up to this triple threats reveal in Frankfurt.
