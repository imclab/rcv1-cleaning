The only problem is finding one. August 2009 BY  CSABA CSERE  PHOTOGRAPHY BY MORGAN SEGAL  Infiniti and Lexus, the luxury divisions of Nissan and Toyota, respectively, both got started in 1989, but while Lexus quickly thrived, Infiniti has struggled. It wasnt until the arrival of the 2003 G35 that Infinitis future began to brighten. The G35 was designed to compete with BMWs powerhouse, the 3-series. The sedan was built on Infinitis excellent FM rear-drive platform, armed with the VQ-series 3.5-liter V-6, and wrapped in sleek and distinctive sheetmetal. Though its interior was not particularly rich, we did appreciate the instrument cluster that moved up and down with the adjustable steering column, improving gauge visibility. And while the powertrain was not quite as smooth as the BMWs, the power was best in class and so was its price. A rakish coupe arrived soon after the sedan, as did an all-wheel-drive x model. The second-generation G arrived in the 2007 model year with useful upgrades in sophistication and refinement as well as more power306 horses, up from the originals 260. The latest G37 has pushed that output all the way to 330 ponies, but pricing has remained very attractive, especially compared with the European competition. Even so, not everyone can afford the $35,000 to $45,000 for a new G. Fear not. In July 2008, Infiniti once again reconstituted its on-again/off-again certified pre-owned (CPO) program. The luxury divisions off-lease and trade-in cars undergo a thorough inspection to ensure they operate like new and look very presentable inside and out. Brakes and tires that are more than half-worn are replaced. To be eligible, vehicles must be less than four years old, have racked up less than 60,000 miles, and have suffered no major damage. New Infinitis come with a four-year/60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and a six-year/70,000-mile warranty on the powertrain. CPO vehicles have these warranties extended to six years and 100,000 miles. There are a few things not covered, and you are charged a $50 fee each time you use the CPO warranty.  Infiniti also offers an extended protection plan for about $1400 (price varies by dealer). It adds another yearup to sevento the warranty, provides coverage for most of the exceptions in the standard CPO protection, and eliminates the $50 fee. Most of the G35s listed on Infinitis website are 2005 through 2008 models, spanning the two generations. Theres a pronounced price jump with the gen-two models, and coupes cost two to three grand more than sedans. Searching for a specific model is easy enough on Infinitis CPO website , but the descriptions of each car often mix the options into a standard-features list, making it difficult to determine just how the car is equipped. You should also be ready to hit the road in search of your dream G model, as there were only about 400 CPO Gs for sale in the entire country as this was written, in contrast to more than 5400 3-series BMWs . But those who want a satisfying and practical sports sedan or coupe at a bargain price will embrace the challenge.
