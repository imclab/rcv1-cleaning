He says, "My wife and I purchased the car new in July, 1978 by trading in our high mileage 1970 Ambassador SST station wagon. The Matador was used primarily in our agricultural consulting business for 6 years and later in our retirement years as a dependable daily driver. Despite its high mileage it still runs well W/O excessive oil consumption. The vehicle has always been garaged and is rust free. All of the maintenance records are available since we drove it off the showroom floor some 26 plus years ago. I consider it a strong #3 by the Old Cars Price Guide." It's for sale, $2000 firm.

It had 12,000 miles on it and I drove it until 1982 then purchased a 1982 AMC Eagle Wagon. The Matador has been stored and been used very seldom through the years, it has 32,000 original miles on the odometer. Everything is original down to the floor mats. The body paint interior and engine are in excellent shape. Now that I have retired I am starting to refurbish it to the condition it was in 1979. There are a few seepage leaks that have to be fixed so I can enjoy it to the max. I would like to show it if I can. Originally I purchased it as an  executive driven car, it was formally driven by the assistant  plant manager of the Richard Street plant, a gentleman by the  name of Harold Borsch who later became the plant manager until  AMC liquidated. I met him in person and he gave me a tour of  the Milwaukee body plant, which at the time was exciting!  Here's the story that went along with the tour. He told me  every year he had his own personal car and that he personally  supervised it through all the assembly operations in Milwaukee  and the Kenosha plant and that it had to be A-1 or heads would  roll. At the time I thought this to be a bunch of BS of  course. But to my surprise a close relative that worked at the  Milwaukee plant who knew Mr. Borsch stated what he told me was  true. The car was carefully watched through all assembly by  quality control. So for me it is somewhat special." Rick Ferron Niagara Falls, Canada 360 2 barrel, 3 spd column shift standard differential Barcelona Cranberry/Claret two tone, burgundy interior, bumper strips, cloth reclining seats, 15" wheels 142,500 kilometers A8A167N VIN, M004772 body code, 78167 model code, 855N trim code, 8D-CB paint code, W014638 production code PS, PB, tilt, heated rear window, AM radio, half vinyl roof, color keyed slot wheels, Rick says, "This car has been well maintained since new by the same owner. It has had a new vinyl top, and been repainted in the original color. The only real flaws are that the paint does have evidence of dust in it, and the interior, while excellent, has seen some sun fading on the front seats. Everything works on this car! Mr. Karges owned about 23 AMC cars in his day, trading them in every year or so. When AMC stopped making the 'big V8' car in 1978, he kept this last one to tow his boat to his cottage up North. This has been the main usage of this car since the mid 1980s. I have a log book that Mr. Karges kept, detailing every time the car has been started and every repair since the mid 1980s (his first book, the one going back to 1978, was unfortunately destroyed with tax records, as for a short time Mr. Karges used the car as a tax write-off)."

PS, PB, AC, Tilt, Cruise, Front/rear sway bars, heated rear window, AM/FM, bumper strips, color keyed slot style wheels, half vinyl top, opera windows, full interior light group, cloth reclining seats Ned says, "This Matador was featured in the Dec. 1996 issue of "Collectible Automobile" magazine. (webmaster note: You can see the whole article on my Literature page.)  Paint is mostly original - some spots cleaned up and  repainted. Interior is original including 3 of the 4 original  floor mats. Over the years I have only changed one headlamp  and one stop light bulb. Never had to change any side guide  lamps or parking lights. The two biggest jobs under the hood  were new AC compressor and front seal  water pump. Years  ago the electric re-wind clock was shorting the cct so I  changed it to a quartz battery clock. Replaced all ball joints  recently and shocks are good." Ned recently sold his car.

In any case it is rare, as only 2006 Coupes were produced that year, and highly optioned! He bought it used, looked great, but that bright finish covered loads of body work from a serious crash that was uncovered when the non-rustproofed repair areas began to rust. It has been parked since 86 and has a terminal case of cancer. Bob Borner Yuma, AZ 360 2bbl, 727 Standard diff.

"I bought this car sight unseen and drove it about 750 miles to the house. I didn't have any problems on the way. The factory manuals came with the car. As time allows I've been wrenching on the mechanicals to ensure it's reliability. I just got done replacing bushings, ball joints and tie rods."
