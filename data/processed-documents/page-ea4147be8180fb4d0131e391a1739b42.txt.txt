OK, before you starting sending us nasty-grams, its not what you think. In the old days, GM was very big on offering something for everyone, with multiple brands, trim levels, a mind-boggling assortment of options, you name it. Well a little financial fiasco has cleared that out, and we now have a much leaner product line on the domestic side. Which is interesting, because it seems like were getting a huge increase of product choices from BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. Take the X1 Crossover, for example. more Tags: bmw , x1 , 2013 x1 , 2013 bmw x1 , crossover , test drives , reviews Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 6 Kia Cross GT Concept Kia Cross GT Concept Kia Cross GT Concept Kia Cross GT Concept Kia Cross GT Concept Kia Cross GT Concept Kia Cross GT Concept: First Look Ryan ZumMallen on 02.08.2013 09:33 An unlikely contender may help usher in the new generation of luxury crossovers, as the Kia Cross GT Concept made its official debut at the Chicago Auto Show this week. more Tags: kia , cross gt , crossover , chicago auto show Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 10 Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept Volkswagen CrossBlue Concept Volkswagen CrossBlue SUV Concept Debuts at NAIAS Jessica Matsumoto on 01.15.2013 03:55 On Monday, Volkswagen of America introduced the CrossBlue SUV concept at the North American International Auto Show. more Tags: volkswagen , crossblue , crossover , naias , hybrid Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 10 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX Quick-Spin Test Drive Ben Lewis on 10.15.2012 09:39 The previous Acura RDX was a very interesting small crossover/SUV with a turbo four-cylinder, sporty ride and handling setup. What it wasnt was a smaller version of the very popular 7-seat MDX SUV, and that left a big gap for buyers who love the Acura brand, but really wanted a 5-seater MDX. Acura, smart folks that they are, answers the call with the new 2013 RDX, which really is much closer to its larger sibling, and an enticing and exciting value, too. more Tags: acura , rdx , mdx , audi , bmw , mercedes-benz , suv , crossover Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 10 2013 Nissan Rogue 2013 Nissan Rogue 2013 Nissan Rogue Interior 2013 Nissan Rogue Cargo 2013 Nissan Rogue 2013 Nissan Rogue 2013 Nissan Rogue Monitor 2013 Nissan Rogue Gauges 2013 Nissan Rogue 2013 Nissan Rogue 2013 Nissan Rogue Priced At $22,310, Adds Special Edition and SL Packages Ryan ZumMallen on 08.21.2012 12:56 Available in S or SV with three packages: Special Edition, Premium Edition and SL Package.For the new model year, the 2013 Nissan Rogue will start at $22,310 and offer two new optional packages with a wide variety of technology and luxury items.The design of the hot-selling Rogue changes little from last year , but Nissan is planning to cut into its Ford Escape and Toyota RAV-4 competition with competitive pricing and a bevy of options. more Tags: nissan , rogue , ford , escape , toyota , rav-4 , crossover Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 8 2013 Honda Accord Coupe 2013 Honda Accord Coupe HondaLink iPhone Login HondaLink App Stations 2013 Honda Accord Coupe 2012 Honda Crosstour 2012 Honda Crosstour 2012 Honda Crosstour Honda Launching HondaLink Internet Connectivity System in 2013 Honda Accord Adam Burpee on 07.24.2012 12:46 Honda announced that it will be launching a new system in the 2013 Accord that will permit Internet connectivity through a smartphone. The system is called HondaLink and it will depend on an iPhone or Android smartphone to access the Internet. There is a wide array of content that can be accessed, including audible Facebook and Twitter updates, local restaurants, podcasts, audiobooks, and Internet radio stations. Other motor companies like Toyota, Hyundai, and Ford have had Internet connectivity enabled in their vehicles for a couple years, but Honda has been holding out, until now. This will surely bring Hondas in-car experience up to par with its competitors. Honda is initiating this system in the 2013 Accord but will later add the system to the 2013 Crosstour. more Tags: Honda Accord , HondaLink , Internet , 2013 Accord , Honda Crosstour , sedan , crossover Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 8 Spied! 2013 Toyota RAV4 Spied! 2013 Toyota RAV4 2012 Toyota RAV4 2012 Toyota RAV4 2012 Toyota RAV4 2012 Toyota RAV4 2012 Toyota RAV4 2012 Toyota RAV4 2013 Toyota RAV4 SPIED: Sneak Peek of a Visually Larger, Redesigned RAV4 Brenda Priddy on 07.18.2012 13:19 Wrapped in camouflage head-to-toe, we photographed the 2013 Toyota Rav4 earlier today. But even covered, these photos show the next RAV4 is going to change quite a bit from its current form and move closer to the crossover mainstream. When the Toyota RAV4 first went on sale in 1996 (read: History of the Crossover ), it was a quirky little SUV powered by a tiny four-cylinder engine. Each successive generation of the RAV4, however, has grown larger and heavier. Today, even a third row of seats is available. The next iteration of the crossover, however, will need to compete with the new Ford Kuga, the Mazda CX-5, as well as the venerable, updated-for-2012 Honda CR-V . That means it will need to retain a roomy cabin and deliver the fuel economy buyers expect. Based on these spy photos, dont be surprised if the new RAV4 arrives on a modified version of the current models platform. Thats because in addition to some drastic stylistic changes, it looks like a size increase may be in store for the 2013 as well. Although most of the car in the photos is covered up, the sweeping roofline and fast windshield make it clear that the new RAV4 will abandon its off-road pretensions and embrace its crossover roots. more Tags: Spied , spy photos , 2013 Toyota RAV4 , crossover , SUV Comments   PHOTO 1 OF 12 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX 2013 Acura RDX: Redesigned Premium Crossover SUV Gets New Look and V6 Power Gary Witzenburg on 07.09.2012 00:06 When Acura sent the RDX out in 2007 to battle the Lexus RX and Infiniti EX both V6-poweredit chose to go with a turbocharged four-cylinder. It was willing and eager, but not as smooth and refined as those rival V6s. Now comes this 2013 Acura RDX with a slicker body, a new six-speed automatic, a new all-wheel-drive system and, yes, a standard 273-hp 3.5-liter V6. It also boasts a longer wheelbase, increased track widths, new Amplitude Reactive Dampers, and more energy-efficient motion-adaptive electronic power steering. Smoother front and rear fascias, a toned-down Acura bird-beak grille, wider wheel flares and a more tapered rear roofline improve the RDXs look and make it more aerodynamically slick, while new underbody panels significantly smooth airflow underneath. The redesigned cabin is more upscale and luxurious and Active Noise Control makes it a quieter environment. Theres more leg- and shoulder room, more cargo capacity, larger door and rear hatch openings, a new (available) power liftgate and a host of upscale features. The 2013 Acura RDX rides on four-wheel independent suspension with MacPherson struts front and multi-links in back. Its longer wheelbase, increased track widths, a lower center of gravity and new Amplitude Reactive Dampers help provide both better handling and a more supple ride, while new motion adaptive electronic power steering replace the previous hydraulic system. more Tags: Acura , 2013 Acura RDX , crossover , CUV , SUV , V6 , V6 crossover , AWD , all-wheel-drive crossover , premium crossover Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 6 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport 2.0T 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport at New York Auto Show 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport Hyundai Brings Fresh Face to Crossovers with 2013 Santa Fe  Santa Fe Sport Ryan ZumMallen on 05.22.2012 11:50 Is any automaker in the world hotter than Hyundai right now? In 2011, the Korean brand shattered their previous sales record by 20 percent and theyre not stopping now. A redesigned 2013 Santa Fe Sport crossover is set to reach dealerships this summer and it could join the Sonata and Elantra as quick customer favorites. With an all-new design and unique features, the 2013 Santa Fe family, which debuted at the New York International Auto Show in April, immediately sets itself apart from its predecessor , and thats the point. Hyundai launched a 7/11 campaign, to introduce seven all-new or redesigned models in the first eleven months of this year, and the new Santa Fe lineup is proof of their commitment to refreshing their models with a more modern and technologically advanced focus. more Tags: hyundai , santa fe , sonata , elantra , azera , crossover Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 13 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape 2013 Ford Escape First Drive Review: 2013 Ford Escape Gary Witzenburg on 05.02.2012 21:31 EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) fuel economy of the 2013 Ford Escape , depending on which models, engines, and drivetrains you compare, is up to five mpg better than the 2012s. The base front-wheel-drive (FWD) S model is powered by a 168-hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder that delivers 22 city and 31 highway mpg, while the smaller but more powerful (178 hp) 1.6-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder is good for 23/33 with FWD. The highest-performance choice is a 240-horsepower 2.0-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder rated at 22/30 mpg. The 1.6-liter EcoBoost engine is standard in SE and SEL models, while the top-level 2013 Ford Escape Titanium comes with the 2.0-liter.There is no V-6, since Fords EcoBoost combination of turbocharging, direct fuel injection, and twin independent variable camshaft timing (Ti-VCT) makes more cylinders and larger displacement unnecessary, even for light towing (up to 3,500 lbs.) All three engines drive through smooth six-speed SelectShift automatics that can be manually shifted through a shifter-mounted switch, and an optional new intelligent 4WD system offers better off-road traction than before. The 2013 Ford Escape looks like a taller Focus because it essentially is. Built on Fords global compact platform, its about the same length as a Focus sedan but 10 inches wider and nearly nine inches taller on a 1.6-in.-longer wheelbase. It leads with the wide-mouthed, mustachioed Focus face with large blackout sections flanking the central opening and wrap-over headlamps atop the fenders. Broad shoulders connect the tops of the head- and taillamps along the base of the six-window greenhouse, while sculpted character creases flow front to rear at door-handle and fender-flare levels. Its also 10 percent aero-sleeker than the boxy old Escape to boost highway fuel economy, and active grille shutters close on models with the 2.5-liter base and 1.6-liter EcoBoost engines to further improve aerodynamics at cruising speeds. more Tags: 2013 Ford Escape , Ford , compact SUV , crossover , crossover SUV , Ford Ecoboost Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 6 2012 Kia Soul 2012 Kia Soul 2012 Kia Soul 2012 Kia Soul 2012 Kia Soul 2012 Kia Soul Quick-Spin Test Drive: 2012 Kia Soul Ben Lewis on 04.16.2012 13:44 Its always impressive when a manufacturer improves upon a product thats already selling very well. And the funky Kia Soul has been a big hit ever since it and its hip-hop Hamster commercial came to market. So when we heard that the 2012 Kia Soul had some serious improvements, we couldnt wait to test the new model. On the outside, the Soul is still the cheeky little hatchback crossover SUV its always been. Our top-of-the-line Soul ! (yes,!) model wore a little more bling, thanks to new LED running lights front and rear. Combined with our testers bright Alien Green paint and 18-inch alloy wheels, it really stood out from the crowd. And if you want to get away from that crowd, the 2012 Souls improvements make a big difference. The more powerful 164-hp 2.0-liter ! model features a standard six-speed automatic, and its acceleration is much stronger than before, which makes the Soul an ideal weapon to slice and dice city traffic. Yet, we found the 2012 Soul ! to be surprisingly calm and composed on the freeway. Kia says steering and braking have been improved, and theyve definitely done their homework. The relatively large 18-inch wheels and tires give plenty of grip in the turns and, combined with the newfound power, make the Soul a ball to drive anywhere. With an EPA rating of 26 city/34 highway, the little Kia is frugal, as well. more Tags: Kia Soul Review , crossover , SUV , hatchback Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 10 2012 Honda CR-V 2012 Honda CR-V 2012 Honda CR-V 2012 Honda CR-V 2012 Honda CR-V 2012 Honda CR-V 2012 Honda CR-V 2012 Honda CR-V 2012 Honda CR-V 2012 Honda CR-V Quick-Spin Test Drive: 2012 Honda CR-V Ben Lewis on 04.09.2012 22:48 The Honda CR-V has always been one of our favorite vehicles. Fun, frugal, and well thought out, its simply the Honda take on the way small crossover SUVs should be. And we appreciate that. Where some competitors have tried to go the rugged off-road direction, and others the more powerful, turbocharged or V6 way, the CR-V was always happy to stay your smart, efficient friend for on-road adventuring. So with an all-new CR-V for 2012, we wondered if Honda had turned the tables to take the CR-V in a new direction? Nah. Hondas smart. It already had a very popular vehicle, so it just looked at ways to make good even better. The looks are certainly a step up. The redesigned 2012 Honda CR-V is one of the first to show off Hondas new design direction, and its more aero, muscular and aggressive. The lines make it appear larger than it is (actually about the same size as the previous generation), and the rear tailgate treatment reminds us of Volvos XC crossover. Sitting on (our EX models) handsome 17-inch alloy wheels, we think the new exterior design is a fresh, upscale look that promises to age well. more Tags: 2012 Honda CR-V review , crossover , SUV , compact crossover Comments  PHOTO 1 OF 5 2013 Subaru XV Crosstek Compact Crossover 2013 Subaru XV Crosstek Compact Crossover 2013 Subaru XV Crosstek Compact Crossover 2013 Subaru XV Crosstek Compact Crossover 2013 Subaru XV Crosstek Compact Crossover New 2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek Compact Crossover SUV: 2012 New York Auto Show James M. Flammang on 04.01.2012 21:28 Subaru is introducing a brand-new model for 2013, which makes its world debut at the New York Auto Show . Billed as a fun to drive compact crossover vehicle, the 2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek is based on the subcompact Subaru Impreza platform. Significant body and chassis revisions have been made, according to Subaru, resulting in a go-anywhere stance and attitude. Premium and step-up Limited editions will be offered. Black side- and wheel-arch cladding, rocker spoiler and rails contrast with the XVs body color. Raised ride height mates with an 8.7-inch ground clearance, to help in clearing obstacles. Up front is a unique grille, matched by distinctive front and rear bumpers, as well as 17-inch wheels. A roof spoiler and dark-tint privacy glass will be standard. Under the XV Crosstreks hood, a 2.0-liter boxer (horizontally-opposed) four-cylinder engine develops 148 horsepower. When the XV goes on sale in fall 2012, buyers may choose a five-speed manual gearbox or Subarus Lineartronic continuously variable transmission (CVT). The manual gearbox incorporates Subarus Incline Start Assist feature, which briefly holds the vehicle while the driver coordinates brake and clutch action to pull away from a stop. The CVT includes a paddle-selected manual mode with six preset ratios, to simulate operation of a conventional transmission. Subaru estimates fuel economy at 23 mpg in city driving and 33 mpg on the highway, with a 15.9-gallon fuel tank. An ECO gauge is standard, to help monitor mileage. more Tags: auto shows , 2012 New York Auto Show , Subaru , crossover , SUV Comments Next posts 1 2 3 Previous posts Acura Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler CODA Dodge Ferrari FIAT Fisker Ford GMC Honda Hyundai Infiniti Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Scion Smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo About | Privacy Policy | Contact  2000 - 2013 autoMedia.com Inc.
