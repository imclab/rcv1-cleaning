They must support small designs and offer a high level of integration, to fit the limited space available in automotive environments. To meet the diverse needs of a variety of automotive applications, developers need solutions that offer: Compliance with strict automotive qualification demands, including industry standards and automotive-qualified fabs Flexible interface options for a variety of HMI capabilities Standards-based connectivity for intelligent networked solutions Protection and compatibility for high-voltage products, including robust electromagnetic compatibility (EMC); electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection; and OEM approvals Resistance to high temperatures for trouble-free operation in automotive environments Maximum safety for automobile access Low power consumption for maximum efficiency A Complete Set of Solutions for Automobiles Atmel® provides a broad product portfolio for automotive applications that meet the strict automotive quality demands and that make vehicles more safe, economical and convenient. Our solutions include: Battery Management  Battery efficiency and lifespan are key elements for automotive battery applications. Li-ion batteries are up to 30 percent smaller and 50 percent lighter than conventional NiMH batteries, yet store considerably more energy. While Li-ion batteries offer concrete advantages in terms of size, weight, recharge speed, life span, and resistance to memory effects, they also quickly lose capacity, and are potentially unsafe if overcharged or discharged too deeply. A battery management system is required to avoid this to happen. For such systems, Atmel provides Li-ion battery management devices that offer high accuracy analog measurement functions in combination with efficient active cell balancing ensuring the optimum usage of the batteries capacity  Car Access  The Atmel® automotive electronic efforts are not only focused on large complex electronic systems, but also on smaller independent applications.
