My how Alice Has Changed !Filming of the Movie The Eleventh Hour aka The Journey Beneath Alice's Bed was An Original Screenplay by David Daniels . This is Fox's way of Discovering New & Upcoming Filmmakers & Actors & Camera People ETC, And it started Raining right on Cue when Filming Started ! The Filmmakers are doing this Short Film on a Relatively Small Budget , but who knows it Might Become the Next Blair Witch Project. It Will be Shown on TV's Bravo , Fox Family Channel & on the Internet ! It Turned out to be a Wonderful Experience & the Cast & Crew were Delightful. After 12 Hours or so of shooting, Around 4 A.M. each morning when filming concluded for that day , they were careful to put everything Back in its Original Place. Filming in such Cramped Quarters must have been a Challenge for the Young Filmmakers ! One of the Stars of the Film is Dead Ringer for a Rita Hayworth lookalike ! Other Characters were a Devil, Billionaire, Derelict, Etc. They also used a Lightning Machine whose Bright Light seemed to Give People Headaches & Many Wore Sunglasses During the Shoot !

At that time, it was located on the Prado Street, next to the Athenian of Madrid. Don Miguel relished alternating between the life of a bohemian bookseller, athenian, and intellectual and his life as an actor in the Spanish Theater of Madrid. Little by little, he became more captivated by the world of books until he left the theater to devote himself entirely to his bookshop. Over time, the shop became a social gathering place for academics, intellectuals, university professors, and many others of diverse cultures and interests. The social and intellectual life of the shop was almost as important to Miguel as the books he was selling. He would later transfer to a location on Lope de Vega Street, where actually the shop is ruled by the son, Miguel Miranda Miravet, just in front of the tomb of Cervantes!
