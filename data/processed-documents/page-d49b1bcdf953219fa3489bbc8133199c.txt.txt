  Close Ad  Arts and Entertainment in the 1930s Home | Art | Movies | Books | Music  Arts and Entertainment in the 1930s were needed, just because  of the fact that during the 30s the Great Depression started. Music, books, movies etc, were a way to entertain people, and  make them see the right side of things, even though many people were out of jobs, and homes.  For Example, Gone with the Wind, known as a classic today, is one of  the best movies created through the 30s. It is a magnificant story, about hard work, and speacially about war, and how people  survived, even though families died and there wasnt much money created, because of the fact that there werent many jobs in  the country.
