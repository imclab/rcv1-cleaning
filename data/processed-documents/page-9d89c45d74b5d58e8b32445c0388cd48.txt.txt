Is Chris Brown finally rubbing off on Rihanna? I always knew Ri Ri was a bit of a bad girl, but I didn’t think she had it in her to be violent towards an adoring fan! Not even Chris Brown would do something like that. Well, ok, he probably would, but still. http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embeddedv=w-EO99khWzY Rihanna was caught on camera whacking a clingy fan with her microphone while performing on her world tour in Birmingham, England. Apparently, Rihanna detoured off stage to touch hands with her beloved fans in the middle of her “We Found Love” performance. When one fan held on a little too long, the songstress was quick to beat him/her off with her microphone. While it isn’t quite sure exactly what the fan was doing, I’m sure Rihanna only did it for her own safety. However, it still remains unclear where the fan was stuck and the severity of the incident.
