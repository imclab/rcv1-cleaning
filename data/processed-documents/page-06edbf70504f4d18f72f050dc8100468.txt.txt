The kulture part of Car Kulture is even more evident. We have nostalgia drag cars, pre-1968 rods, gorgeous seductive DeLuxe Gals pin-ups in every issue, a few bobbers, and great cars: kustoms, hot rods, straight-axle asphalt burners, and more. There are more artists featured and we delve into more history of various aspects of the car kulture, including drag racing, hot rods, customs, and clubs. Experience more rockabilly and psychobilly band coverage, too, including band interviews in addition to the CD reviews.
