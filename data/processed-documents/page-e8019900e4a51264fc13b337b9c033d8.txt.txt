PHOTOS: CORVETTE TURNS 60 Imagining the Corvette convertible might have seemed easy when it was revealed earlier this year, but these photos show how the car takes advantage of the sleek lines of the car. The roof itself uses a three-ply fabric, while GM reveals that the top features sound-absorbing padding and a glass rear window, helping to keep the cabin quiet when the roof is up. Inside, the convertible appears to be identical to the standard hard-top Stingray. With its tonneau cover down, however, the stylish lines of the seventh-generation Corvette steal the show. Taking advantage of its looks, the Corvette Stingray features a waterfall design feature which brings the car's exterior color inside, playing up the convertible experience.
