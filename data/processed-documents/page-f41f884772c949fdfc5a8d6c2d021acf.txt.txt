Monday, November 23, 2009 Auto-Culture: Miles per gallon ratings short-circuited by electric power The Tesla Roadster is a fully electric sports car, and is the first car to be produced by electric car firm Tesla Motors. Tesla claims prototypes have been able to accelerate from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in under 4 seconds, and reach a top speed of over 130 mph (210 km/h). Additionally, the car will be able to travel 221 miles (356 km) on a single charge of its lithium-ion battery. The Roadster's efficiency is reported as 133 Wh/km (4.7 mi/kWh), equivalent to 135 mpgU.S [ctrl-click image to launch YouTube video]. Caption and Image Credit: ebaumsworld.com Auto-Culture: Miles per gallon ratings short-circuited by electric power The ratings systems that determine the efficiency of a car's use of fuel output is becoming effectively outdated and unreflective in an alternative power world. Take, for example, a car that has as a power plant an all-electric engine ... like a Chevy Volt. If one were to use the old standard "Mile Per Gallon" ratings system, the new Chevy Volt electric car has a projected fuel economy equal to 230 mpg. A more realistic view upon which to comparatively judge the power effectiveness of a car, wither it be gasoline, hybrid, alternative-fuel, or electric would be a new system that focuses on an average monthly cost to a consumer based upon a defined usage parameter. In an Automotive News (April, 2009) interview, new GM CEO Fritz Henderson, admitted the obvious - that GM will not be able to make their first mass-produced electric car both affordable and profitable for a long time, saying that GM plans to lose money with Gen-1 and 2 of the Chevy Volt. We have been very clear with the task force, particularly in Gen-1 technology, like the Volt, the cost is high, Henderson said. And that means, it doesnt necessarily pay the rent. It actually consumes rent when its launched.

Edmunds.com is asking the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to come up with fuel-cost ratings to assist buyers in comparing the cars. On Sept. 15, the agency asked for public comments on emissions and fuel economy standards for plug-in electric and hybrid cars. A consumer could reasonably assume, based on the way that they have been using window stickers now going back to 1975, that the Chevy Volt is over four times more efficient to operate than the Toyota Prius . And [that] would actually be completely wrong, said Jeremy Anwyl, CEO of Edmunds.com. Edmunds.com would like for the EPA to stop allowing car makers to promote vehicles based on mpg. If car companies are building cars with very high monthly costs from a fuel perspective, thats the sort of information that needs to be out there, he said.
