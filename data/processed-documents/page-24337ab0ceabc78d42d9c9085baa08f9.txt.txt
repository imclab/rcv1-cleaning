And hes already been arrested in connection with the incident. TMZ reported that, 2 Chainz tour bus was pulled over in OKC around midnight after police noticed its taillights were out. When they approached the vehicle, cops say they noticed signs of drug use and attempted to board the bus. But the bus driver locked the police out, insisting they obtain a warrant first. Police did just that and eventually entered the bus hours later, where they arrested 11 passengers for interfering with the police process, including 2 Chainz. Its unclear if they face additional charges, or whether police found drugs.

But Bobbi has suddenly dropped out of Celebrity Big Brother. The Sun newspaper reported that the young star had withdrawn from the program after receiving online abuse after the news broke that she was going in the house. The paper quoted a Channel Five insider as saying that despite having a large budget, they are having problems attracting the big US names they need to get the big ratings. They said: They knew there were guaranteed fireworks with her in the house and hoped theyd also get some revelations about Whitney. But they added: But she did a massive U-turn and sent the bosses into a panic. As it stands theyve got loads of money to spend but theyre struggling to find anyone to give it to.

Since 50 thinks he was unfairly treated, he is seeking ti have the allegedly bias ruling overturned,according to court docs. TMZ Writes; Earlier this year 50 and company called Sleek Audio were embroiled in a bitter lawsuit. 50 claimed Sleek owed him over $261,000. Sleek said otherwise. The case went to arbitration  a binding process in which an arbitrator picks the winner. Bad news for 50, the arbitrator sided with Sleek (the final $$$ judgement was kept under wraps). But 50 refuses to gently into that good night  and is taking the battle to federal court  claiming the arbitration judge discriminated against him because hes black, associates with controversial African-American figures AND because hes a high profile rap artist. Specifically  50 says the bias ran so deep the judge didnt allow him to cross-examine witnesses and refused to look at evidence pertaining to the case. Pretty bold claims. He wants the award axed ASAP and is asking for a new hearing  where he says hell prove the judge was out to get him from the get go. Sleek fired back too  claiming 50s allegations of racism are a desperate attempt to avoid the arbitration decision and get it brought before an actual court.
