That said, sometimes they hang around, and Richard Kauffman of Millersburg, Ohio, believes that to be the case with his stolen 1971 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme convertible. Kauffman bought the Cutlass in 1994 for $1,500 and proceeded to restore it with a buddy of his in Moss Green with gold stripes and a white top and interior. An Olds 350-powered and air-conditioning-equipped car, the Cutlass also saw a few modifications along the way, including a Hurst dual-gate shifter, custom stereo and CD changer, and a Hotchkiss two-inch front drop kit. Kauffman also added a tilt steering column and Tic Toc Tach. I wouldnt say it was mint, Kauffman said. I drove it. I like to drive my cars around. Â  Stolen on the morning of May 6, 2012, from the Canfield Fairgrounds in Canfield, Ohio, the Cutlass was at the time wearing Ohio license plates CPE9032 and VIN 34671M186059. Kauffman is offering a $1,000 reward for any information leading to the return of his car. Anybody with information about the cars whereabouts should contact Kauffman at 330-893-3283 or the Mahoning County Sheriffs Office at 330-480-5000, reference report number 6-1205-007.

IÂ´d agree and say the vehicle is still in the area if in fact it was not marked by a collector to be stolen. Good luck in finding your car. Reply  Randy says: April 15, 2013 at 9:30 am My friend had a 69 SS396 Chevelle  a 64 impala SS stolen out of his garagelast May. he searched frntoically finally putting a CA$H reward out on the street 3 months later got a phone call from a scorned girlfriend. They recovered both cars in tact and busted a ring with over 72 vehicles in it. Reply  Glen Morales says: April 15, 2013 at 9:34 am Omg I think I saw that very car on a transporter last Friday , on the I -10 heading here in California ill keep an eye out and will ask the local car clubs sorry for your loss Reply  richard says: April 15, 2013 at 7:26 pm Thanks. I appreciate that. Reply  richard says: May 29, 2013 at 1:28 pm Hey, I just a call from San Francisco,CA. Someone was looking to buy a 1971 Cutlass convertible and ran the VIN numbers. It came back stolen, and he remembered seeing my stolen car ad. He called me this morning to say the VIN numbers match my VIN number that I have in the ad. He also told me the Mexicans have it and painted the car BLACK, but it still has the white interior. He does not want to get involved and wouldnt give me any contact info. Does anyone out in San Francisco know of such a place that is owned by the Mexicans? Reply richard says: May 29, 2013 at 3:44 pm Is Interstate 10 near San Francisco? I believe my car was spotted out there. I have information that the car was painted black. Reply Jon says: April 15, 2013 at 9:35 am Too bad, hope he gets it back in good shape! But from the tailights, it looks like a 72 model, I worked for Olds in 71-72 and the 71 models didnt have the grillwork in the tail lights. Reply  iitywybad says: April 15, 2013 at 9:58 am I think they used a lot of interchangeable parts on the GM cars of that era. I had a 1971 Monte Carlo and it had a 1972 grill. Reply  dukeisduke says: April 15, 2013 at 11:02 am Yep, the 71 has the over-and-under horizontal lamps without the little dividers. The grille is a 71, though. Ive known a couple of guys that owned 72 models, and this was back when they were just used cars, not yet classics. Reply  BlackMax says: April 15, 2013 at 11:56 am 71 was indeed a two segment taillight, the six is 72 Reply bigredrivi says: April 15, 2013 at 9:41 am Almost a year later and now you notify Hemmings? Good Luck! I have noticed that some firms are selling the boot. I noticed where a contractor used one on his truck and one on his trailer when his truck was parked at a construction site. Maybe now is the time to use the boot on collector cars??? Reply  Daniel Strohl says: April 15, 2013 at 9:50 am Actually, he let us know last year, shortly after it was stolen, and we published a notice in the pages of Hemmings Motor News then. Reply  Alan Mills says: April 15, 2013 at 10:30 am The boot was one of the first things I tought of too. Thief would need a torch or heavy duty power cutter. Either would draw a lot of attention. Ive heard of missing cars found months later; heres hoping. Reply  richard says: April 15, 2013 at 7:23 pm Actually, I did have an ad in Hemmings last summer. Reply Rob L. says: April 15, 2013 at 10:03 am Im wondering why a car stolen a year ago rates the daily feature article on Hemmings? Reply  Steve R. says: April 15, 2013 at 10:07 am This is one of many reasons I keep my garage door down when ever possible, too many preying eyes driving by! Reply  gregO says: April 15, 2013 at 10:12 am Daniel, I hope that you are able to be reunited with your baby. I had a vehicle stolen back in the 80s but it only took about a month to find it. I wish people would respect other peoples property rights (and not steal). Reply  larry young says: April 15, 2013 at 10:20 am hey Daniel ! my 89 springer was stolen @ back to the fifties in 91,what can you do to help ? have a good day,Lar. Reply  Daniel Strohl says: April 15, 2013 at 10:43 am Larry, we want to see all collector vehicles returned to their rightful owners. What we require for a stolen vehicle notice: copy of the police report, VIN, photos of the stolen vehicle, full description of the vehicle. Reply  larry young says: April 15, 2013 at 10:50 am thank you but im sure it was chopped up for parts that same day.its so easy with a bike as theyre so small and easy to sell off the parts.one was stolen before mine with only a thousand miles on it.it became big business 1-2 years on as everyone wanted a bike and Harley couldnt build them fast enough. Reply Harvey says: April 15, 2013 at 10:29 am I had a 71 Cutlass S and I was just wondering why a 71? Cutlass Supreme has tail lights for a 72? Reply  Carmen Angelo says: April 15, 2013 at 11:39 am I never understood how someone could enjoy what they stoled from someone elseHope somthing good comes out of it and you find the car in the mean time will keep my eyes peeled and my ears on sonarGood Luck. Reply  Jeff says: April 15, 2013 at 11:41 am This fellow car guys car was stolen, and all that some of you can do is pick apart the fact he has a different year tail light on his car. Really! Reply  Bob H. says: April 15, 2013 at 12:26 pm I think these differences that some are pointing out could be helpful. If I were to see a vehicle that fits the discription another identifying feature would be be beneficial. Reply  Dell says: April 15, 2013 at 9:05 pm I agree. I dont think it is being picky in this case, its a matter of noting something that we, as car enthusiasts, would pick up and help ID it as the one that was stolen. Ive read countless cases where a unique feature helped prove to authorities that a vehicle was indeed stolen, especially if there was a color change. Reply Ron Kapp says: April 15, 2013 at 12:32 pm I think you do a fantastic service Daniel with letting the collector car fraternity know about what to look for stolen cars. We are all friends who thanks to you can be part of that 6 degrees of separation to help find a car. I agree with Jeff how petty to be concerned about a tail light issue or why you (Daniel) would write about a stolen collector car. I hope you get your car back today! Reply  Bobby Miller says: April 15, 2013 at 12:40 pm Im with Jeff about the picking a guys car apart. Thats the reason I never pay to show my cars anymore, regardless of the charity that benefits. NEVER does anyone come up and say something positive, like thanks for bringing your car out, I enjoyed looking at it. Nooooooooo, comments are always negative, like this widget is wrong, why dont your do this, why dont you do that, you need to fix this, mine didnt have that dohickey, that thing got the right engine? The hobby isnt what it used to be and thats sad. Reply  Johnny_Fontane says: April 15, 2013 at 4:42 pm I had no idea that people would say something negative to an owner at a car show. I have only heard positive comments and I live in the Capitol of rudeness  Boston, MA. Very sad, indeed. Reply  Kevin Preston says: April 16, 2013 at 1:49 am Bobby,funny you should say that. A few years ago I was at the Spring Fling Mopar show in Van Nuys with my son. A guy there had a gorgeous two door 1957 Imperial that he was showing. I have a 1957 Imperial Crown Four Door that I have never driven, bought it as a project car in 1995 and have never even sat in the car for a few minutes (believe me, you dont want to sit in it in its present condition!). Anyways, I was very curious what any Imperial of that vintage drove like, so I went up to the owner, introduced myself, and asked him how his car drove, as I had a 1957 four door that I was going to restore. The guy turned to me with a look of utter disgust, and said, why would you want to restore a useless sedan and smirked. Immediately, his little blond friend giggled and said hes got more money in his chrome than your car will ever be worth! I just turned to my son and said so the whole group could hear clearly, You see son, no matter where you go, what club you belong to, or whatever hobby you enjoy, theres an a-hole in every crowd. Of course neither the guy or little Sparkles had a come back for that one. I secretly hoped that his brakes went out on the way home, but I kept that one to myself. Reply  Peter says: April 16, 2013 at 7:41 am One born every minute! LOL! Theres some good people too. Theyre just harder to find! Reply Andrew Franks says: April 15, 2013 at 12:50 pm Its a nice sexy car. If I see it I will raise the flag. Notify Hemmings immediately and call the cops. Reply  jim says: April 15, 2013 at 1:11 pm the stolen VW was recovered per his website and i hope this car is to. Reply  Olddavid says: April 15, 2013 at 1:26 pm One of my favorite cars. Great combination of style and power. Mine was mechanically repaired and used for my daily driver while moving to Canada for work. Imagine trying to move across international border today with an old car full of personal belongings and nothing but a drivers license and a story. Took two minutes. I cannot imagine losing my pet project to thieves. Especially a self-restored one that he put his bruised knuckles and late nights into. Envy and greed are the ugly side of our consumer culture. If I see any Cutlass convert in Oregon, Ill make a point to check the VIN. Lets find this for a fellow gearhead. Reply  Dann Gadbois says: April 15, 2013 at 2:32 pm Formerly naive about the boldness and cleverness of thieves, a while back I suffered from the loss of a Carmen Red XKE from in front of my garage (down a mile-long private dead-end road). During a warm summer night of polishing, I Ieft the car outside while a got a quick snack in my house. When I returned the XKE was gone  so much for the Neighborhood Watch! While filling out the Sheriffs Stolen Car Report Form I had the option of being notified by law enforcement agencies when the car was found (so that I could pick up the car myself); or, to authorize immediate impoundment by a tow truck company. I would really recommend the latter. The XKE was located by a sharpie tow truck driver in the middle of the night and about 50 miles away. Hope your convert is back home soon! Reply  rollie demay says: April 15, 2013 at 2:48 pm Hemmings readers are everywhere. We all can understand the loss of a prized car,..my eyes, and those of thousands more, are looking. This is why stolens are posted. Reply  Michael Waters says: April 15, 2013 at 4:51 pm Sincerest wishes that Mr. Kauffman can recover his Cutlass soon and hoping that its in good shape when found. I think everyone whos an owner or fan of the collector car hobby feels a small aching pang when someone suffers theft of their pride and joy. Reply  Michael Waters says: April 15, 2013 at 4:52 pm And some bit of inner rage, too. Reply richard says: April 15, 2013 at 7:27 pm Thanks everyone for your support. Reply  Caalan says: April 15, 2013 at 7:52 pm Back in July 1967 while visitng las Vegas my 1960 Studebaker Regal Hardtop was stolen.No insurance,To this day I find myself looking for a Colonial red 60 hardtop with 61 tailiight lenses Im now 71 and I guess hope never dies! Reply  Fran Zetts says: April 15, 2013 at 8:09 pm I will keep an eye out for it. Born and raised in Struthers, lived in Boardman till retirement, work as a teacher and Asst. Principal in Youngstown City schoolsmy truck was stolen from hospital parking lot, since that the only thing I would put on a car was the Club on sterring wheel. So many kids will steal a car for joy rides, etc, but there is a huge racket in stealing cars in the Valley. Would not leave a car out without kill switch and club. One school, we had all the teachers put Clubs on cars as they would sneak into parking lots to steel cars. Feel bad BUT WILL keep eye out. I sound a little extreme, but they should have a few hangings like the old West when a horse was stolenwhen I would tell this to kids talk about wide eyed. Reply  packratDave says: April 16, 2013 at 6:20 am keep a eye open in upstate NY Reply  Sean Wynne says: April 16, 2013 at 9:44 am Wouldnt think it would show up at an Olds show. There arent that many around and you guys stick together. Maybe call the major auctioneers in surrounding states. Nice car though. Reply  Marve Adler says: April 17, 2013 at 6:34 am I hope you get this back. What a shame you were victimized. Reply  Hanno Niidas says: April 18, 2013 at 7:47 am I live in France and work in Switzerland but man alive I pray you get your car back ! Reply  Duane says: April 18, 2013 at 5:15 pm Big eye is out in central Maryland. Being a multiple Olds owner and enthusiast, I really empathize with this situation. Reply  Dave says: April 19, 2013 at 5:46 pm Now this is a worth while car. At least this wasnt some worthless VW Beetle. Reply  Terry says: April 21, 2013 at 5:44 am Run your vin through the national data base for stolen cars, ckeck with your DMV did you get the serial numbers off the rear end, a lot of cars data plates are switched out, maybe your friend stole it from you? maybe you should have used a lojack!
