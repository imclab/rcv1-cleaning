September 12 Stage Whispers: Conversations with Theatre Professionals As part of the Department of Theatre and Music Studies' alliance with Geva Theatre Center, this series of interactive panels allows attendees to discover various aspects of making theatre. In a healthy dose of happenstance, Almost, Maine playwright John Cariani will appear as the initial guest at this yearÂs "Stage Whispers: Conversations with Theatre Professionals" series three weeks prior to the opening of that play at The College at BrockportÂs Tower Fine Arts Center Mainstage. Cariani will speak about the mythical, mystical Northeast town where several of his plays take place, his transition from actor to playwright and the pre-production process for his play, Last Gas , which will be seen later this season at Geva Theatre Center. "Stage Whispers" takes place on Thursday, September 12, 2013, at 10 am, in the CollegeÂs Tower Fine Arts Center Black Box Theatre, 180 Holley Street. The talk is free and open to the public. Cariani, who was nominated for a Tony AwardÂ® for his performance in the most recent Broadway revival of Fiddler on the Roof , has also appeared in many television series, including his recurring appearances as ÂBeckÂ on Law and Order: Criminal Intent , and in several feature films, including Kissing Jessica Stein . His evolution from onstage to offstage artist stemmed from what he considered a dearth of decent audition material for men. So he took it upon himself to create his own. That audition piece begat a series of monologues that were presented at an NBC-sponsored event for budding playwrights. Eventually, he realized that some of the monologues (which had numbered more than 20 at the time) were thematically related, drew on his childhood in Presque Isle, ME, and were all a bit fantastical. In their review of Almost, Maine , The New York Times indicated that Cariani Âis working from the notion that the remoter expanses of the country are the natural harbor of the adorably lovelorn, the touched and the irretrievably lost.Â The ÂStage WhispersÂ series is sponsored by The College at BrockportÂs Department of Theatre and Music Studies in conjunction with their educational partnership with Geva Theatre Center. The series gives community members insight into the process of professional theatre artists. For more information, please call (585) 395-2787.

With those elements, one could construct a computer or other complex machine. In the series Life Industries , Andrew Au imagines an industrial plant that manufactures and markets living things, the necessary construction being merely code that explains a sequence of events to make the organism viable. The series includes paintings, prints, sculpture and a mockumentary about the inner workings inside Life Industries. In Irrational Exuberance, Amy Cheng brings together a new series of sumptuously intricate ornamental paintings. Loosely anchored on the notion of the mandala, the paintings are richly referential: they call to mind the cosmos, cells, lace, brocade and more. Cheng aligns herself with the long tradition of geometric and floral patterns which the Far East, the Middle East, the Byzantine and the Baroque have long employed.
