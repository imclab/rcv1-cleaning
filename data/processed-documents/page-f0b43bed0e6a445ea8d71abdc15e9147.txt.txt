There are plenty of advantages to buying cars on craigslist, and cars.com for resell. You can get excellent deals! A lot of the time you can get cars cheaper than what dealers pay for them. Like anything there are also disadvantages like: If theres a really good deal, the seller is getting tons of calls. You can be on your way over there, and by the time youre halfway there, the car is already sold. Other times you get there, and some other guy pulls up ten minutes later. You both want the car and youre in an awkward situation. You drive far and by the time you get there see the car was grossly misrepresented. This has happened a bunch of times. Sometimes you get really lucky and strike gold. I look in the classifieds for certain cars that are rare, and not often found at dealer auctions.  It's safer to buy a car privately than from a public auto auction if the vehicle at the auction doesn't come with a guarantee. If you buy privately you can do a much more thorough inspection of the car. You can test drive it, take it to a mechanic, etc. You can't test drive cars at public auto auctions.

On some city streets around where I work there will be a whole row of cars with For Sale signs in them.

Go to ones recommended by others in the business. With time you'll start to find a couple of shops that, give you a wholesale price, and that you trust. I have certain mechanics I go to for certain things. For instance I have a guy I go to just for my diesel vehicles. I have my main place where I get the majority of my work done at a great price. Then, I have my guy whom I go to when my first place can't do the work. I don't go to him first because he's a lot more expensive but a much better mechanic. Find a good smog technician! I can't over emphasize that enough. I pay $30 each for my smog tests, and certificates. Try buying good cars with bad paint. Fewer people are interested in them, and they sell for much less. I get decent quality paint jobs done for $280, and any dents fixed on top of that for a very reasonable price, depending on the size. Small dents cost me $20 a piece to fix You should be paying anywhere from $90 to $140 to replace a windshield depending on the car. I pay $50 each for new tires. Brake jobs shouldn't be any more than $120. How not to waste time on the phone with a potential buyer pageok   If a buyer says Can I have your address so I can come see the car this weekend? say Call me and hour before you come by, and I'll give it to you then.Often, Ill spend a lot of time giving a potential buyer my address, and directions. It takes ten times longer if I'm talking to a foreigner who doesn't speak English very well. I'll spend all that time, and the buyer ends up not showing up, without bothering to call.

I was thinking of targetting Japanese imports and even moreso.....importing cars from japan if possible. What do you think about that? Waste of time? Hondas and Toyotas are some of the best cars to flip but there very hard to get cheap. Try Hyundai and Kia. There are plenty of them around you can get pretty cheap with low miles, and they're very economical. The ones with automatic transmission will sell faster. I don't know how you would import cars from Japan unless you have connections over there. I think you would be more inclined to exporting cars to Japan.  5/11/2010 David's question: pageok  I'd like to be legal in selling cars im gonna go for my dealers licence.What would happen if you get caught selling cars without a dealers license? Can i get arrested, ticketed or what? Normally when i sell a car i use a bill of sales. The first from the seller to me then the second i make as a gift to a friend and use his name to sell it.or i just use the same price as i got it to the my purchaser in the car value.has worked well i guess lol.but its time to open up a lot with cars under 5k In my opinion you'll only get in trouble if your doing shady things like committing fraud. Some examples are selling cars with salvage titles, odometer roll back history, wrong paperwork etc. Screwing people over will get you in trouble fast. Otherwise you really don't have anything to worry about. I'm not advocating selling cars without a license because it's not legal. Not only that most people who sell cars on the side lie to the prospective buyer about it. It seems like your selling a couple on the side for some extra cash. If you want to get serious about it you'll have to become a dealer. Back To Top pageok
