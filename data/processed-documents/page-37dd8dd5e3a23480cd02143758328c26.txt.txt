You’ll notice that our primary focus revolves around performance vehicles, since that’s where our passion lies, and I’m sure yours as well. It’s also our goal to further bridge the gap between the road vehicles we all love and the modified performance versions that compete on the weekend. We prominently feature the American Le Mans Series, but we also cover Grand-Am racing and more niche competitions as well. While we strive to bring our readers quality analysis and automotive journalism, we also understand that not even Shakespeare would be fully capable of putting into words some of the vehicles we discuss. Sports cars have to be seen and heard to be fully appreciated, which is what our video section is all about. There you’ll find the best car videos from around the web that’s sure to keep you glued to your computer screen. To get in touch with us, please use the form below.
