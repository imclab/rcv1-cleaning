There are many rumors circulating however, what has been confirmed so far is that Subarus car will be turbo and have all wheel drive. Some Subaru insiders have also revealed that the cars will have different codes. In Japan, the version of the FT-86 will be known by the code 086A and in the US and Europe, they will be known as the 087A and 088A respectively. Meanwhile, the Fuji Heavy Industries version will be branded as the 216A, obviously coined to clearly distinguish between the Toyota and Subaru version of the car. It has also been confirmed that the car will be driven by a 2.0-liter turbo charged powerplant providing power to all four wheels. Its still undetermined whether this will be more like a revised, lower power but more efficient 250ps and 34.0kg/m EJ20 from the Impreza 2.0 GT or akin to the EJ20 Turbo from the current Impreza WRX STi producing 308ps and 43.0kg/m of torque. There are more who share the opinion that the EJ20 Turbo will win out for the STi version of the car down the track. With regards to the body, the Subaru version will be bigger and will weigh about 100kg more than the 086A. The weight gain is a result of the addition of 4WD as well as the increase in the dimensions (about 20mm all around). Height will rise from 1260mm to 1280mm while width will increase from 1760 to 1780mm. Wheelbase and total lengths have also been increased, making the car have an overall length reaching 4180mm. The wheelbase gains 30 to 50mm, up to around 2600~mm from 2570mm. Its becoming apparent that these measurements are quite similar to the current Imprezas 2620mm, making it highly probable that they will be sharing parts. The other question on peoples minds would be if the price would vary much. It is believed that the improved performance, all wheel drive and extended body will mean the buyer has to add about half a million yen to the tag bringing the car to be priced at about 3 million yen in 2011.
