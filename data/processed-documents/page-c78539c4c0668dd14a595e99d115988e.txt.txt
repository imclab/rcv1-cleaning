More Info  Customer Testimonials Dependable, reliable, willing to go above and beyond, community service--those are the words I think of when I hear the name Boehmer. My husband was a Scoutmaster for over 20 years. Several times, when our Suburban decided to give up just before a camp out, Boehmers always managed to get it back on the road in time. We have purchased a number of cars in the past 50 years from Boehmer and have never been disappointed.
