You may have even built a paper  car or truck  yourself. But we know youre secretly wondering what would happen if some insane origami craftsmen built an entire full-size car out of paper.

Posted on August 26, 2013 by Ben We just spent two days driving every new Nissan vehicle produces, from the Moco kei car to the Cabstar truck (more on this soon). Which got us thinking: What non-car Japanese nostalgic vehicle would you love to drive? By 1974 Mazda was fully invested in the rotary engine, putting them in everything from sports coupes to luxury sedans to, yes, even a bus. The Mazda Parkway 26  could carry you and 25 friends in premium comfort, with such amenities as a soft ceiling trim and three-stage heating. Not would would you be driving the worlds only 13B-powered bus, but one of the rarest old Japanese vehicles around. Only 44 were every built over four years of production.

We all know that old cars could use a bump in the cooling department, and theyve come out with high-quality aluminum radiators for the Datsun 510  and 240Z , as well as the  first-gen Toyota Celica  and AE86 . Now one for the second-gen Corollas like the TE27  is in the works.  Continue reading  4 Comments Posted in Product Guide, toyota| //MOVED for JNCTagged corolla, koyorad, levin, Product Guide, radiator, sprinter, te27, toyota, trueno// REMOVED for JNC | REMOVED for JNC CRYSTAL, ANYONE? Breaking Bad Toyota Tercel 4WD Wagon Posted on August 22, 2013 by Ben Unless youve been living under a rock you probably know that a little TV program called  Breaking Bad  is heading chaotically towards its series finale. Only six episodes of the show remain and filming has already wrapped. Thats why one of its star cars, a 1983 Toyota Tercel 4WD Wagon driven by the character Jesse Pinkman, is for sale on eBay .  Continue reading  3 Comments Posted in film/tv, for sale, toyota| //MOVED for JNCTagged Breaking Bad, sprinter carib, tercel, toyota// REMOVED for JNC | REMOVED for JNC EVENTS: Vintage Auto Salon, Part 03  Bayline Cruisers Posted on August 21, 2013 by Ben For the third and final installment of our Vintage Auto Salon coverage, we take a look at cars that arent necessarily the rarest or the sportiest .

Posted on August 19, 2013 by Ben Youre piloting your dream Japanese classic, its drop dead sexiness outshined only by your spouse in the passenger seat, dressed to the nines in an evening gown (or tuxedo, we dont discriminate). Lights dance across the gleaming hood as you pull up to the opera house. A valet opens your door. Which JNC will the valet park front and center at the opera? Lets face it. Were not (yet) living in a world where a Corolla or 510 will get you that primo spot right in front of the main entrance to the concert hall/Playboy Club/Monaco casino. But theres plenty of nostalgics that would. A Mazda Cosmo Sport is pure sleekness. A 2000GTs worth a million bucks. If youre arriving in a Toyota Century your chauffeur will likely park it for you. Which one exudes so much class they cant help but show it off as an example of their well-heeled clientele?

Million Dollar Baby, Part 02 Posted on August 15, 2013 by John Two months ago a shockwave was sent through the automotive world when a 1967 Toyota 2000GT became the first Japanese car to break the million dollar barrier. 1,155,000 buckaroos to be exact. But was it a fluke? Well, we shall find out this weekend when this 1968 Toyota 2000GT crosses the block at RM Auctions at the Monterey Historics.  Continue reading  8 Comments Posted in for sale, toyota| //MOVED for JNCTagged 2000gt, kidney anyone, toyota// REMOVED for JNC | REMOVED for JNC EVENTS: Vintage Auto Salon, Part 01  JDM Machines Posted on August 15, 2013 by Ben Vintage Auto Salon is the third show of its kind held by  Historic J , the team thats quickly becoming the de facto force for nostalgics in the Bay Area.
