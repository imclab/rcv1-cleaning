LMBO 08/26/2013 Wale Ft. Rihanna  Bad  Remix Aug 27 ABC News Attempts To Scientifically Break Down Twerking Written By Ms_Toni at 10:58 on 08/27/2013 in Celebrity Comedy , Celebrity News Share on Tumblr Yes, this is a real thing.  Apparently Miley Cyrus and her twerking ( please note this term is being used very loosely ) has America in disarray.  And that has bled over into the media.   ABC News posted an article about the scientific explanation of Twerking. Again, YES. This is a real thing. Twerking is such a complex, technical subject, only a Ph.D. researcher can explain how the body does what it does to make it happen. Twerking is a combination movement involving a deep squat and a pelvic tilt, Michelle Olson, a professor of exercise science and a certified strength and conditioning coach at Auburn University in Montgomery, Ala., explained.“You take a wide stance with your legs turned out at 10 and 2 so your hips are externally rotated,” she said. “Then you pulse up and down as you thrust the pelvis bone forward and back.” Continue Reading  Comments { 0 } Aug 27 Jay Z Shields Beyoncé From A Fight That Diddy Started At VMAs After Party Written By Ms_Toni at 08:38 on 08/27/2013 in Celebrity Awards , Celebrity Drama , Celebrity Fights , Celebrity News , Celebrity Party Share on Tumblr Whats an awards show without an awards show after party in which a fight breaks out?  According to The New York Daily News , Diddy hosted a VMA after party at Dream Downtown with girlfriend Cassie .  Also in attendance were Jay Z and Beyoncé . Seems that someone apparently got too close to Diddy and Cassie for comfort and Diddy proceeded to get into a fight with them.   Beyoncé then started shouting for them to stop and Jay Z stepped up to separate people and get Bey to safety. Side Note: According to rumors circulating around the internet, that certain someone was allegedly rapper J Cole . -BUT- according to Diddy those rumors are false!!! Diddy cleared up those rumors quickly via twitter: I usually dont address rumors but I got too much respect for my bro @ JColeNC . We are friends. The rumors are not true. We had a great party Whew! That sounds like a SNL skit waiting to happen!  Seems like there was a bunch of witnesses to the fight too.   Jamie Foxx , Pharrell , Will.I.Am , Busta Rhymes and Russell Simmons were all watching from the sidelines.   Continue Reading  Comments { 0 } Aug 26 Miley Cyrus Twerking For Art! LMBO Written By MrsGrapevine 2 at 21:47 on 08/26/2013 in 2013 MTV VMAs , Celebrity Humor , Celebrity Kids , Celebrity Photos , Publicity Stunt Share on Tumblr Both Lady GaGa and Miley Cyrus performed at the VMAs last night. One performance was deemed a provocative theatrical work of art, and the other performance will probably increase attendance in church this Sunday among Disney age kids. Since Miley Cyruss performance was far from a work of art, the fine folks at Buzz Feed decided to help Miss Miley out twerking on famous paintings . The worse GIF of them all, I couldnt even bring myself to post, but you can check it out here , via The Gossip Wrap Up . The GIF features Miley Cyrus at the Last Supper twerkin for Jesus . Oh My! Nooooo!!!! Sadly the GIF puts it all in perspective, would we really do this in front of Jesus . *sigh* Comments { 2 } Aug 26 VMA Performances: Miley Cyrus, Robin Thicke, Drake, Macklemore  More Written By Jade Ashley at 15:15 on 08/26/2013 in 2013 MTV VMAs , Celebrity Awards , Celebrity Events , Celebrity Music , Celebrity News Share on Tumblr As the Video Music Awards came to Brooklyn last night, there were plenty of performances that were the talk of the night. One of those performances being Miley Cyrus as she tried to twerk all over the stage and twerk all over Paula Pattons husband Robin Thicke . Another performance was Kanye West as he performed his track Blood on the Leaves from his current album Yeezus . Macklemore and Ryan Lewis made their VMA debut last night with a little help from Jennifer Hudson and MTV made sure to catch Rihannas facial expression during Drakes performance of Hold  On, Were Going Home and Started From The Bottom .

Smith Family Reacts To Miley Cyrus? Written By MrsGrapevine 2 at 09:42 on 08/26/2013 in 2013 MTV VMAs , Celebrity Awards , Celebrity Family , Celebrity Music , Celebrity News , Celebrity Photos Share on Tumblr A very popular .gif from the VMAs has made its rounds across the internet, with some very misleading headlines. The Smith Family ( Will , Jaden , and Willow ) really did make the now infamous faces seen below, but they were totally taken out of context. Although, the expressions written across their faces reflect how I felt while watching Miley Cyruss performance, it doesnt reflect what the Smith Family as a whole was thinking. In fact, the .gif was actually taken during Lady GaGas Applause set. If you watch the whole thing you can see that Will and Willow were actually enjoying the performance, and well, Jaden Smith , I think thats just how he looks Continue Reading  Comments { 3 } Aug 26 MTV VMA Red Carpet Looks  Lady GaGa, Ciara, Robin Thicke, Miley Cyrus Written By MrsGrapevine 2 at 09:09 on 08/26/2013 in 2013 MTV VMAs , Celebrity Awards , Celebrity Fashion , Celebrity Music , Celebrity News , Celebrity Photos , Celebrity Red Carpet Share on Tumblr The 2013 MTV Video Music Awards ( VMA ) transformed the streets of Brooklyn with red carpet and bright movie lights. Instead of walking down a traditional red carpet at the event facility, celebs actually hit the streets of Brooklyn to showcase their style. Lady GaGas ability to transform her looks and her body is amazing, Miley Cyrus on the other hand, will regret the year 2013 five years from now, and Katy Ratchet Perry showed off her multicolor kitty grill. Fashion wise, Rihannas very casual look is probably my favorite of the night.
