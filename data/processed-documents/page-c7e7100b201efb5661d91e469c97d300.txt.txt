The vehicle, never named, was a proposed Mercury version of todays Ford Taurus S (nee Freestyle) . Mercury planned to introduce the vehicle as a 2008 model earlier this year, but abruptly dropped the project when the Sable was discontinued last year. Finding this sequence tough to follow? Thats no surprise, given the name changes Ford has thrown us recently. You have the one-year life span of the Lincoln Zephyrnow the Lincoln MKX as a prime example of the companys addiction to name erasing. Remember Sable? Or Thunderbird? The original Taurus? The Five Hundred, Windstar and Freestar? Now, with the premature death of the Mercury crossover pictured above and at right, the company has gone to new lengths in its name-change rampagekilling a whole vehicle before it even got a moniker.
