Enlightening people about the ethical origins of food was a challenge, especially when culinary choice wasn't much more than sprinkling wheat germ on salad. By Jessica Leigh Lebos Don't mess with Marshals Griffin had taken on the proverbial "surfer dude" look, totally opposite of his 2005 appearance. Editor's Note: Testing our patience Soon the hated CRCT will be phased out in favor of a new test. Its passing will be mourned like that of polio. By Jim Morekis Wilmington gets a market of their own Wilmington Island cuts the ribbon on fresh food and good times By Jessica Leigh Lebos Midnight Garden Ride FAQs Info about this year's event By John Bennett Editor's Note: Civic (Center) pride Despite the high dollars involved, choosing an arena site in order to spur localized development in one particular neighborhood is small-time thinking. By Jim Morekis Music & Clubs Jam with Eric Culberson again "When I was not playing music for a living, Jam Night was huge for me," he says. "Because I could go out and do my thing with a band. On a stage."

By Lee Heidel A sweet new vodka line Local launches Southern-flavored spirit By Jessica Leigh Lebos 21st Century tasting notes Untappd is an app for iOS and Android that allows you to "check in" to the beers you've tried. You can assign each beer a "cap" rating between one and five, with one being a drain pour and five being nirvana. You can also add your tasting notes, a photo and the location where you enjoyed your beer.
