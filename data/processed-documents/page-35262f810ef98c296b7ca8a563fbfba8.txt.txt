See More This place is a nice and friendly place - at least it was for me... I had a great experience buying my car. The impression I got was that they really care about the customer .... they took the time to explain to me my credit situation, and which type of financing I would qualify for, etc. The salesman, Edward, was very frienldy and didnt pressure me into buying the first thing i saw.. actually he was very patience and showed me 5 or 6 different vehicles until I made my decision. I think some people get confused when they say that some small dealers charge us (consumers) too much interest.. usually the dealer is not responsible for deciding the interest rate, the finance institution is. (Unless you go to some car dealerships which do their own financing - "In-house finance"). Be aware of this type of financing cause you usually end it up paying a higher interest rate on those.. However it might be the only way for you to get a vehicle and start building your credit (again). So, my advice is do your homework before going to any place to do a major purchase..for me, I knew I didnt have good credit so I knew I wasnt going to get the best interest rate possible, but I was pretty happy I was able to get a nice car still. I ended up buying a Pontiac G6 2006 and they also gave me a 30 day warranty on it! Thanks again Certified Auto Dear , Thank you for helping Yahoo! to identify and block abusive comments.

See More I strongly disagree , I had very good experience with the Certified Auto. Me and my husband, who is a sgt in marine corps , came to buy a car about 3 months ago. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The salesperson Marcio and Ricky showed us many different cars to accomandate our needs and options. I felt very good about buying car from them. We end up buying great Mazda 6. I am loving it. I highly recommend this dealership. Great service and good cars Thank you Dear , Thank you for helping Yahoo! to identify and block abusive comments.
