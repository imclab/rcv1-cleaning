A concept version of the vehicle was unveiled Monday at the Detroit auto show . Measuring 169.3 inches long, Honda's Urban SUV Concept is 9 inches shorter than the Honda CR-V . Honda expects the vehicle to sell strongly in urban markets. It will compete with vehicles such as the Nissan Juke . Honda's crossover most likely will share with the next-generation Fit a 1.5-liter inline-four with an estimated 127 hp and 111 lb-ft of torque. The interior will include Honda's configurable fold-flat "Magic Seat" setup in the second row of seats. The crossover will go on sale in Japan by the end of this year, with a U.S. on-sale date of early 2014. Starting in spring 2014, production of the North American version will occur in Celaya, Mexico. The crossover is a key part of Honda's global growth strategy. Sales of the Fit and its platform derivatives are expected to double to 1.5 million units by 2016.
