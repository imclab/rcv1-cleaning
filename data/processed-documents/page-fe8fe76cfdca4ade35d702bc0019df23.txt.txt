    1-800 CARS Inc |  Media Center   Exclusively from CARS Inc. For over 30 years CARS Inc. has been reproducing sheetmetal, parts, and hand-sewn interiors for some of the most famous Chevys - including the 1955 Chevy Bel Air Convertible. The first part that CARS Inc. offered was a simple emblem, but over time CARS Inc. added many more items to enable people to restore their own classic Chevys - since most of these parts were no longer available from GM - or from anywhere else. As the years rolled by, more and more items for the 1955 Chevy became available as reproduction parts. Today, the items you would need to build a 1955 Chevy are all available - and that is why we at CARS Inc. have decided to offer a complete 1955 Chevy Convertible body (entire car also available). The core of the car is an original 55 cowl section, but the rest of the car is made with exact reproduction sheetmetal that has been engineered to fit and last for generations to come. We hope you will take advantage of this unique opportunity to own your American Icon - a 1955 Chevy Bel Air. Please call 1-800 CARS Inc to reserve your 1955 Chevy Convertible today!
