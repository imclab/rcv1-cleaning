Leggy ladies with amazing butt shaking skills multiplied by 10 seemed like the theme of the video as Robin Thicke unleashed another set of his charm while his son Julian dressed in a suit provided the video some coolness to it as you can see there’s barely any inch left in the field to accommodate another legbomber! Other than ditching his shirt on one occasion the father of one just hung out there chilling out and the job of impressing was done. I mean you’ve got to admit he is a looker. His wife is a generous and tolerant woman I must say to allow so many ladies hover round her shirtless husband!

The last time 55 year old Alec was all busy getting things done and staying by Hilaria’s side but now that the baby has safely arrived he cleaned up well and looked hot as ever. Their age gap was hardly noticeable as Alec and Hilaria took some fresh air and walked their dogs in and around Washington Square park. Hilaria wore black to look toned down maybe but then again the 29 year old Yoga instructor didn’t look like the celebrities who fuss over baby weight too much.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt who is also the director of Don Jon or more precisely his onscreen character finds himself in an uncharacteristically odd situation of disbelief when the romance lover character played by Scarlett Johansson leaves him hot and heavy with a promise of fulfillment at a later date in a “conditions apply” kind of way. Scarlett does it once again i.e the job of heating up the screen while Gordon-Levitt’s porn loving character suffers the disappointment he never thought a hunk like him could ever experience. This is no wham bam, thank you mam story! Treat your senses to some fine acting here!

Athough we do get to see the duo out on shopping or just spending some leisurely time together, this time it was a little different as disarmingly adorable Flynn was feeling drowsy in the cutest possible way much unlike his usual energetic self. 30 year old Miranda looked gorgeous in a floor length outfit as she cradled Flynn in her arms with care and Flynn though sleepy did stand out KeepReading More on: New York , new york city , Victoria’s Secret Leave a Comment  Zach Braff and Kate Hudson take pleasure in beer and dusk in Santa Monica (PHOTOS) Kate Hudson and Zach Braff film scenes for Wish I was Here at the beach in Santa Monica 1 day ago Leave a Comment Photos , Sightings Tweet  View the Gallery / 3 Photos  Kate Hudson@ Glamour Topless Kate Hudson Has A Lot To Reveal About Herself Read More   Kate Hudson on ELLE cover Kate Hudson has some nice things to say about fiancé Matt Bellamy as she features on ELLE mag 6 Photos  I wish I was there as well because the light and the weather of the beach when Kate Hudson and Zach Braff sat themselves comfortably sipping on a chilled beer looked nothing short of pure bliss. Seemingly the onscreen couple was in the middle of a romantic scene for their upcoming flick “Wish I was Here” and Kate had the faraway look in her eyes that though was a part of their scene did generate from the beautiful view the scenes were being shot in. From the look on the stars faces it felt like they were just chilling for real and the whole thing was worked into the script.

The performance was all orchestrated and it’s not like Robin Thicke didn’t expect Miley to twerk with him or shall I say “in front of him” while the dad of one was left in a situation that, on standard, was a condition that required tremendous self control or am I just thinking too much? Robin passed that condition with flying colours as he and Miley rocked their respective hits on the stage before the most expressive audience ever and by that I primarily mean Will Smith and his family who gave the ultimate facial expressions of disgust while Miley twerk-ed. They surely weren’t expecting that!
