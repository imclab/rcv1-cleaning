Even Wholesale Hi, Josh Rosenberg here. I'm a recently-retired Auto Broker who's still devoted to helping the average person get a great deal on the new or used car of their choice. Most people hate the whole car buying process. On the other hand, I actually love it and somehow became quite good at it. So, I'm here to simply pass along my knowledge and experience to, in effect, help you become your own Auto Broker and to take the mystery, distrust and stress out of car buying ... and all while getting just the very best out-the-door prices possible. Ready to get started? Are you looking for a new car or a used one? New Cars : How To Always Get The Lowest Price The CarWoo Anonymous Quote System TrueCar's "Prices Paid" Advantage My target prices for either new and used cars are almost always "wholesale". For new cars, this can be a little hard to pinpoint because the readily available "invoice price" numbers on the web no longer truly reflect a dealer's cost. But you'll get a much better feel for "wholesale" on a specific new car by learning the lowest prices already paid in your area (more on this in the above articles). Used Cars : Best Used Car Buying Method Wholesale Auto Auction Opportunities Wholesale Opportunities On Dealer Lots For used cars, wholesale represents a purchase at or below a vehicle's trade-in value. And what is a vehicle's true trade-in value? Well, this can get a little tricky. But essentially, it's the price a Dealer would pay for the same vehicle at any given moment in time at a Dealer-Only car auction. (Here's more on "wholesale" and "trade-in" values .) Car Loans : How To Get The Lowest Rate Car Loans Try to stay away from traditional Car Dealership loans. They're simply the most likely to put a much bigger dent in your wallet. Most car buyers don't realize that while Car Dealers are obviously trying to make a nice profit on the car, they can also ring up big extra profits on the financing as well. It can be a real double whammy on the unaware and you can likely do much better elsewhere. Car Insurance : How To Save On Car Insurance It seems like the vast majority of people take little interest in their auto insurance. Well, they're very likely flushing away a significant amount of very hard-earned dollars. Insurance may be boring, but spending a few minutes to review the key factors as well as where to get quick and easy quotes from competing insurers can rack up thousands of dollars in savings over time. A Message From Josh : I know alot of people who love the thought of driving around in a new car, but hate the thought of going through the agonizing, stress-filled and distrustful process of buying one. Why does buying a new or used car have to be so unpleasant, anyway? Sadly, that's simply the way the auto industry is structured to operate. And until that changes to where all car prices are fixed and are no longer negotiated, like buying nearly everything else, the process will remain muddled and distasteful, often exceedingly so. Well, let's change that right now, okay? In addition to being somewhat of a car fanatic, for years before my retirement I was an Auto Broker, buying cars for customers on their behalf at great prices and without any hassle. Somehow, the business spread far and wide and we had clients from all over the country, even internationally (here's some customer testimonials from those days ... just a few years ago, actually). But I guess I'm not quite fully retired afterall. You see, I'd still very much like to share my experiences in hopes of helping many more car buyers help themselves. So, I've simply decided to teach everyday consumers everything I know about how to buy either a new or used car at the best possible price by basically acting as their own Auto Broker ... and it's not difficult at all. There's also more here as well to help car shoppers. In addition to car buying and money-saving advice, you'll also find information on both new and used car models to help narrow down your wish list. Welcome, hope you enjoy the site and let me know about your great deal. All the best, Josh And checkout our Facebook page for more tips, car news and fun.
