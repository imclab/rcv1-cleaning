Click here to start your search. The 2014 BMW M6 Gran Coupe and 4-series coupe concept made their public debuts at the 2013 Detroit auto show . BMW introduced the two vehicles alongside the 2013 320i sedan , which appeared for the first time in America. 2014 BMW M6 Gran Coupe BMW The 2014 BMW M6 Gran Coupe debuted at the 2013 Detroit auto show. The ">2014 M6 Gran Coupe will join a 6-series -derived lineup that already includes the two-door M6 coupe and convertible . A unique front fascia, widened wheel arches, a carbon fiber-reinforced roof panel and -- of course -- a handful of M badges set the M6 Gran Coupe apart from its tamer 6-series counterpart. Like the two-door and the drop-top, the M6 Gran Coupe will be powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 with an output of 560 hp and 500 lb-ft of torque. The gearbox is a seven-speed dual-clutch unit also found in the BMW M5 and existing models in the M6 range. BMW claims that the M6 Gran Coupe will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, the same time as the two-door M6. The base model's top speed of 155 mph can be upped to 189 if the buyer opts for the driver's package. There's no word on how much that performance-enhancing driver's package will add to the M6 Gran Coupe's estimated $110,000 base price. BMW 4-series coupe concept BMW Presented as a design study, the 4-series coupe concept debuted at the 2013 Detroit auto show. While BMW confirmed performance specifications of the production M6 Gran Coupe, the automaker presented the new ">4-series coupe as a design study rather than a retail-ready vehicle. Still, we expect the final version -- set for sale in late 2013 as a 2014 model -- to closely resemble the concept shown in Detroit. The design of the 4-series coupe draws much of its design inspiration from current 3-series two-door. That's hardly an accident; according to BMW, the longer, wider 4-series coupe will replace the 3-series coupe outright. The 4-series coupe will then form the basis of a 4-series lineup that may grow include a convertible, a four-door Gran Coupe and a performance-oriented M4. BMW has not released a full set of specifications or expected performance figures for the 4-series coupe, but the automaker has suggested that its xDrive all-wheel drive system may find its way on to some versions of the two-door. About the Detroit auto show The annual North American International Auto Show, better known as the Detroit auto show, has maintained its place as a barometer for the entire industry. For 2013, NAIAS takes place Jan. 14-27 and will host concept cars, green cars and supercars from all the major automakers, including what's expected to be a highlight this year: the new 2014 Chevrolet Corvette .
