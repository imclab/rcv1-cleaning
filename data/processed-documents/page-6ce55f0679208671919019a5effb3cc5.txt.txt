State Law Implied Warranties Private sales usually are not covered by the" impliedwarranties " of state law. That means a private sale probably will be on an"as is" basis, unless your purchase agreement with the seller specificallystates otherwise. If you have a written contract, the seller must live up to thepromises stated in the contract. The car also may be covered by a manufacturer'swarranty or a separately purchased service contract. However, warranties andservice contracts may not be transferable, and other limits or costs may apply.Before you buy the car, ask to review its warranty or service contract.
