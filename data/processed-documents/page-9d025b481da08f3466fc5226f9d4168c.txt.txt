Hope it is better close up.  llaroo ( View Profile ) Posted on 6/11/2013 10:51:27 PM | reply to this comment | Votes: 1 Damn, it looks exactly like the 3-series minus the two rear doors.

LexSucks ( View Profile ) Posted on 6/12/2013 1:54:59 PM | reply to this comment | Votes: 2 It's amazing how the BMW 4-series coupe concept can look like this... http://therealdeal.com/blog/2013/06/12/dolly-lenz-leaving-elliman-sources/ and the actual production model looks like the car in the picture above. BMW's concept cars have a history of looking nothing like their production counterparts.

Looking at the "official" pictures in the Autospies gallery, the reality is just completely underwhelming. The A5/S5, even prior to this year's refresh, still looks better.  cidflekken ( View Profile ) Posted on 6/14/2013 3:17:51 PM | reply to this comment | Votes: 4 Add your Comments Images hosted in your AgentSpace can now be posted in the comments section using the following syntax (case matters): [img]IMAGE URL[/img] Example: [img]http://agent001.myautospies.com/images/sample.jpg[/img] Email Me When Someone Replies To My Message Login | Sign Up  Submit an article  Register to vote, post articles, write comments, and interact with fellow auto enthusiasts   Photo Galleries        AutoSpies presents the best Auto Show Photos , Automotive Videos , Car Reviews and Hot Rides .
