This fall, Rolling Stone unites the two and presents Car Culture'01, an annual issue devoted to motors and music. The issue, cover date 11/08/01 and ad closing date 9/19/01,explores leading design centers in America where hot young engineersresponsible for sensations like the PT Cruiser and the Bug arecranking out tomorrow's most coveted cars. It then detours into thegrand, self-expressive world of the automotive after-market. Songs like the Beach Boys' Little Deuce Coupe, Prince's LittleRed Corvette and Springsteen's Pink Cadillac demonstrate thepassionate connection between cars and rock and roll music, says RobGregory, Publisher of Rolling Stone. What better place to see thisunion come to life than in the pages of Rolling Stone.   php //include virtual="/frm-templates/2006-search-boxes.include" ?
