Hyundai Genesis Coupe high resolution wallpapers Hyundai Genesis Coupe review: Hyundai unveiled Genesis Coupe, a new benchmark for affordable 300-horsepower sports coupes, during a press conference at the New York International Auto Show today. The 2010 Genesis Coupe is a purpose-built rear-wheel drive sports coupe featuring two performance-focused engines Ã¢ÂÂ a 212-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine and a range-topping all-aluminum 306-horsepower, DOHC 3.8-liter V6 engine. Genesis Coupe is scheduled to join the Hyundai lineup in the spring of 2009. Following the introduction earlier this year of the rear-wheel drive Genesis sports sedan, Genesis Coupe is Hyundai`s most dynamic performance car ever and the second consecutive all-new model introduction from Hyundai appealing directly to the car enthusiast. Genesis Coupe uses the same flexible rear-wheel drive architecture that was originally developed for the Genesis sports sedan. Genesis Coupe employs a MacPherson strut dual-link front suspension and a five-link rear suspension setup. Both engines are mated to a standard six-speed manual transmission. The Genesis Coupe 2.0t (2.0-liter 4-cylinder turbo) offers an optional five-speed automatic with SHIFTRONICÃÂ® while the 3.8-liter V6 offers a ZF six-speed automatic transmission with SHIFTRONIC to handle the additional torque. "We think our entry-level Genesis Coupe 2.0t, with its unique combination of rear-wheel drive and four-cylinder turbo power, offers an intriguing alternative to existing front-wheel drive sports coupes," said John Krafcik, vice president, product development and strategic planning, Hyundai Motor America. "The 3.8-liter version of Genesis Coupe takes things to an even higher level, rivaling the capability of premium-performance coupes like Infiniti G37." Genesis Coupe was shown as a concept at the 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show and its transformation from concept to production reveals that its signature design features have emerged intact. Genesis Coupe is also unmistakably linked to several Hyundai concept cars. The powerful curves, surface detail, and "Z" bodyside lines come straight from the HCD9 Talus and the HCD8 sports coupe. Genesis Coupe`s arching roofline and tapering greenhouse highlight the exterior profile and emphasize the car`s broad shoulders and wide stance. Genesis Coupe rides on standard 18-inch alloy wheels or optional 19-inch wheels, both delivering a bold stance and aggressive handling. In keeping with its mission to be the most exciting, affordable sports coupe on the road, the Genesis Coupe boasts a cockpit designed to enhance the driving experience. An information display screen, features an outside temperature reading, audio system information and HVAC settings. Analog gauges include a large speedometer and tachometer positioned so the driver can immediately access critical driving information. The instrument cluster features Hyundai`s signature blue gauge illumination. Music lovers will welcome the inclusion of standard auxiliary input jacks (3.5 mm mini-jack and USB input) to accommodate and charge audio devices such as iPodsÃÂ®. Among the other refinements are an Infinity audio system, sport bucket seats and two-stage front seat warmers. Genesis Coupe also offers the convenience of a proximity key and push button starter. The 2010 Genesis Coupe includes a wide range of both active and passive safety features. Standard safety equipment includes driver and front passenger advanced frontal airbags, along with front seat-mounted side airbags, side air curtains, active front head restraints, four-channel ABS with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), and Electronic Stability Control (ESC), one of the industry`s most effective life-saving technologies.
