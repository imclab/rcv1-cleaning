Sounds good to us Tweet Pin It  The big supercharged 5.8-liter V8 makes 662 hp and 631 lb-ft of torque. The GT500 handles well, but the back end will step out around the corners if the driver isn't careful. The exterior styling is aggressive, but still has that classic Mustang look.

There are too many blue and white, white and black, and blue and black GT500 s. The weather was cool, so I didn't put the top down but I'm sure it would look even sweeter, like all convertibles do. I had the car in the rain. It's basically undrivable in those conditions. Slipping the clutch as smoothly as possible will get you into gear, but any throttle pressure lights up the tires like nobody's business. I was a bit surprised, too, because the tires seemed relatively fresh. In any gear, at any rpm, a jab of the throttle will turn the traction control light on. It is damn fast though. The next morning in dry weather, the back tires would still get loose in second and third gear. I almost think our hardtop version was tuned down as this drop-top feels much faster. And it shouldn't, because it weighs more than the hardtop. I'll be interested to know if anyone else thinks the same. Other than that, I love the suede on the steering wheel, the shifter is the best in the pony car set and Sync seems to be working better than ever. So for $64,000 you get 662 horses? That sounds like a good deal to me. NEWS EDITOR GREG MIGLIORE: Packing 662-hp in a pony car is almost unbelievable. It's a spectacular output for a relatively small package, and a challenge to drive in some conditions. Like stop-and-go in rush hour -- no thanks. Once past that that accident-strewn mess, the fun began. And when I dropped the top and blasted into work later, it was a truly sporting experience. It's a rocket. The engine sounds amazing. The chorus as you downshift is intoxicating. On one stretch of the expressway I dropped down a gear, jabbed the throttle and just felt the whole experience. It's an outstanding engine. The six-speed manual has quick, precise shifts, and is actually pretty agreeable to work at speed. The heavy clutch is formidable in the traffic, though, and you literally need to be on your toes. Looking out over the long hood is exciting, and driving this thing requires a harnessed energy, concentration and focus. I find it rewarding. It's righteous to make hard turns, and the back end will swing impressively if that's what you want to happen. It's also an involuntary reflex, so it's important to stay sharp. The chassis is tight as heck, and it feels a little unsettled at times. But it also has a true, raw dynamic, which I like. The steering could be a bit stiffer, however, for my taste. The interior is solid. The seats, materials and accents all make for a setting that says Shelby. And yes, it's a blast to drive. I'd say this one would truly make Ol' Shel grin. 2013 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 Convertible Base Price: $59,995 As-Tested Price: $63,490 Drivetrain: 5.8-liter supercharged V8; RWD, six-speed manual Output: 662 hp @ 6,500 rpm, 631 lb-ft @ 4,000 rpm Curb Weight: 3,970 lb Fuel Economy (EPA City/Highway/Combined): 15/24/18 mpg AW Observed Fuel Economy: 16.6 mpg Options: Rapid spec 821A SVT performance package including Torsen differential, 3.31 axle ratio, unique 19-inch painted forged-aluminum front wheels, 20-inch painted forged-aluminum rear wheels, Bilstein cockpit selectable dampers, unique rear springs ($3,495) Get more car news, reviews and opinion every day: Sign up to have the Autoweek Daily Drive delivered right to your inbox.
