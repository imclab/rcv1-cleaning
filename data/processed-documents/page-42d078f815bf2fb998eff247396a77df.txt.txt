The rise of the otherside of car culture  Dogging in China.  Jul 8, 2011 Posted by FrankF In Culture Comments 15 Getting some automobile action The Chinese car market is headline news across the world, just over 30 years ago people were barely making a living in China but within a generation China has leapfrogged the worldâ€™s top economy and is currently sitting on Americaâ€™s coat tails and has the potential to become the worldâ€™s biggest economy in the next two decades. But what about Chinaâ€™s car culture? If car ownership is increasing, then a car culture must be developing at the same time. Early car culture was based on â€˜ face â€™, Â success was measured by the displacement badge on the back of your car, Vâ€™s were held in high regard but the increasing price of gasoline changed this habit rather quickly, now small displacement turbo engines are the way forward for many users. Hatchbacks were not popular for quite a long time as they were deemed unsafe due to the lack of an impact area in case of a crash whilst sedan versions of existing hatchbacks looked like marginally bigger vehicles yet again giving more  face  for less money. As the 80â€™s and 90â€™s generation take to the roads en masse due to the supply of low cost cars that can be picked up new for as little as 40,000rmb on the road (and including taxes), the automobile is all about delivering freedom, freedom from the pressure of living in a close knit family, freedom from peer pressure at university and work, and freedom from the monotony of daily life. Another area of unique Chinese car culture are car clubs. In the past 5 years car clubs have exploded in China, there are car clubs for particular brands, there are car clubs for particular models, there are off road clubs specifically for SUVâ€™s, luxury car clubs etc etc, basically thereâ€™s a club for everyone. Clubs use their group buying power to negotiate cheaper driving holidays, lower cost insurance and often go on road trips together, sometimes long distance but most of the time closer to home sightseeing and in the case of luxury car clubs, they usually get together for media attention and to show off their latest Veyron. The dark underbelly of car culture is already making an appearance in China: Dogging (the act of having relations of a sexual nature within an automobile). Dogging has long been a Western past time, but in recent years dogging hit the mainstream in China with it often being reported on by the Chinese media and often talked about in online forums and chat rooms. As per usual, Chinese have come up with a simplified but awesome name for the act, it is simply called Che Zhen which could be roughly translated as Car Quake and Doggers (those taking part in the act) are simply referred to as Car Quake Tribe ( Che Zhen Zu ) . Any casual observer of Hollywood movies over the past four decades would have you believe that North American teenagers are regularly bumping uglies in the trunks of their cars, whilst over the pond in the UK dogging has become so mainstream that its practically a dinner table conversation topic, in Southern Europe practically everyone under the age of 50 owes their life to their parents getting frisky in the back of a Renault 5 or a Fiat 125. Chinese media have been quick to point out the top car quake spots in various cities, this page shows Qingdaoâ€™s own top spots , this Shanghai based driver was kind enough to drive around the city and put forward his own dogging spots complete with evidence of previous visitors (Di Shui Lake in Pudong Xin Qu, if youre interested!), in Beijing Bei Qing Road seems to be a hotspot and Bai Yun Shan in Guangdong are all listed online as being good sites for getting some automotive action going, some online posts even go into detail regarding the amount of shade available and the times that security guards carry out their security rounds. From preliminary research it appears that Hangzhou is not only one of Chinas most livable cities, but also a top dogging city with plenty of suggestions coming from netizens as to the best places in town to rock your cars suspension. Sun Rui and his chick Doing the no pants dance inside automobiles is not just limited to regular people, several high profile celebrities have also been caught in the act within their cars, of course these became known as  Che Zhen Gates (with -gate being added to any sort of shocking news in China). One of Chinas top directors, Gu Zhang Wei was caught by Southern Daily journalists in 2009 getting his jig on in Beijings suburbs with an unnamed lady. Mr. Gu was sensible enough to choose a suitable vehicle with a Mercedes Viano MPV which no doubt provided plenty of room for various positions. Chinese basketball player Sun Rui was also caught with his pants down with a mysterious young lady in a Mercedes GL SUV, of course the Chinese internet went wild with such news. It really should come as no surprise that as car ownership increases so do other activities, but it surprising to Western ears to learn that the stereotypes about Chinese being a conservative people are not always accurate. How Che Zhen culture will grow, or be eradicated, in China is certainly going to be interesting to watch.

Having it away with your girlfriend or wife in a car is not dogging. Dogging is when you go to a carpark and have it away with strangers who come to the Dogging spot to have sex with horny strangers. Subtle but MASSIVE difference. CCT July 8, 2011 We do not profess to be dogging experts, when the idea for the article was coined by me It was put forth in an email with each person giving a rough idea of what it was like in their particular area. Next time we will approach an external consultant  you seem to have the appropriate knowledge and possibly practical experience judging by your comment mark July 8, 2011 My understanding of dogging was you have it with your partner in a car but watched by an audience of voyeurs in a known meeting place.  woxihuanpijiu July 8, 2011 You poms sure have some interesting customs dont ya? Glad to see that out in the colonial backwaters having a shag in the back of the car with the missus isnt seen as some obscure form of car culture. CCT July 8, 2011 Damn  everyones a pro at this, except me. CCT July 8, 2011 Actually, I think we call what you are referring to animal abuse  Gerald July 9, 2011 Awesome article, guys! This would qualify on a best of list for CCT. Just one minor comment  I think it would be very difficult to do it in the trunk? By the way, what happened to the mobile version of this site?  Gerald July 9, 2011 You probably meant back seat instead of trunks.  Gerald July 9, 2011 And me..  Gerald July 9, 2011 Does it count if your best friend is making out with a girl he just met at the bar in the backseat of your car, while youre driving the two of them home?  Gerald July 9, 2011 One additional comment  the popularity of (online) clubs in China is no doubt due to the exploding internet usage and social media here. There are online clubs for everything  group buys, expectant mothers, residents of your apartment complex, etc. CCT July 9, 2011 Killed the mobile site as it got hacked once or twice, and a few complaints as people didnt like to be forced into a mobile site on their glorious iPhones that could handle a real site. Thanks for the praise!  woxihuanpijiu July 9, 2011 Roflonly in the South Island.  thomas July 10, 2011 Sex, yes, but were not British. UK Dogging July 14, 2011 How many people live in China? Yes. billions. Youd have to think millions would be into dogging wouldnt you?  Leave a Comment  Click here to cancel reply.
