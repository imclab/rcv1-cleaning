Our small size and the intimate setting of the Fine Arts Quadrangle facilitate this close relationship. Each of our faculty is active in his or her own professional development -- whether performing, exhibiting, or publishing -- and they bring this expertise and energy to the classroom as well. Please use this site to learn about our faculty and our many exciting programs in the visual and performing arts. Thank you for your interest.
