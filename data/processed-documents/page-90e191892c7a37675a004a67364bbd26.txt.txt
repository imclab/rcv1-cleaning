This extraordinary collection of thirteen images includes many of the artist's most celebrated paintings. Claude Monet 2014 Wall Calendar Claude Monet 2014 Wall Calendar Throughout his long career of painting outdoors (en plein air), Claude Monet brilliantly captured the glory of radiant color in natural light. Included in this calendar are works from throughout Monet's career, from his early paintings with figures and clear details, to the almost abstract, late career renderings of his garden at Giverny. Claude Monet 2014 Mini Wall Calendar In childhood, Monet learned the basics of drawing from a student of the great Neoclassical master Jacques-Louis David. But instead of minutely detailed scenes of Roman drama, he preferred more familiar subjects, such as landscapes, captured with quick, flickering touches of the brush. With his friends Renoir and Sisley, he founded the movement that came to be called Impressionism. Among the many immortal works this school produced are Monet's extraordinary studies of his water garden, two of which are reproduced here. Monet 2014 Mini Wall Calendar Jewish Museum 2014 Calendar  Spanning three continents and two hundred years, the remarkable works of art reproduced here-including paintings by Max Weber, Marc Chagall, and é”Ÿouard Vuillard-communicate the aesthetic values and skill of their creators while revealing distinctive aspects of Jewish culture.

Includes weekly Torah readings, candlelighting times for selected cities, and blessings to be said over the candles.
