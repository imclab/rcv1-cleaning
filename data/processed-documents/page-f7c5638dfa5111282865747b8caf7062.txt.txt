Both demand great stretches of reading time. The important differences are obvious in "Fantastic! The Art of Comics and Illusion " at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. Comics can be funny, topical, raunchy and pop with a graphic flair almost never seen in conceptual art. (A related show, "Zap, Crash and Burn: Underground Comics and the Bay Area," appears a block east at the Cartoon Art Museum ; a single ticket buys admission to both venues.) "Fantastic!" is divided into three sections, subtitled "Raw, Boiled and Cooked," "Widescreen" and "Bay Area Blast," but visitors may not even notice the partitions. For comics offer -- indeed, often require -- an absorption on the viewer's part that people miss in most other contemporary art. Absorption promises relief from the burdensome sense of self -- as powerlessness, isolation and futility -- that the speed and complexity of contemporary life impose. In fact, many of the comics artists showing at Yerba Buena confront dilemmas of conscience and emotion that make being human seem like a chore. Kaz's four-frame strip "Underworld No. 241" (1997), for example, shows a mendicant on crutches who laments, "It's getting harder and harder for a one- legged man to panhandle these days." Legless in the second frame, he reflects, "Cutting off the other one didn't help much either." "I thought for sure this would do," his severed head says in the next frame. In the last, only an eyeball remains, saying, "Maybe if I cry." In no other medium could this absurd, gruesome comedy be played out with such economy, except perhaps in prose. For behind Kaz's topical satire of derelict logic and "compassion fatigue" may lurk a reference to Samuel Beckett 's trilogy of novels, whose protagonist devolves from hobbling wreck to paralytic to brain in a jar. When it comes to social issues, comics artists run on different time tracks from both editorial cartoonists and conceptualists. The California power swindle and the dot-com bust regain currency when Bay Area comics artist Lloyd Dangle takes them on. Whatever may have become of feminism, it appears ripe for rethinking in Carol Lay 's loopy riff on paranoia and guilt, "Hypno-sexism." And no one who reads Keith Knight 's ingenious comics can think of racism as a dead issue. People unacquainted with contemporary comics may be shocked to see how often violence and vengeful or sadistic fantasy find expression in them. Sometimes graphic brilliance nearly offsets a puerility and primitivism that is hard to take, as in the "Widescreen" section of the show. But only in rare cases, such as David Mazzucchelli 's "Stop the Hair Nude" (1995), do arresting design and drawing meet truly unsettling narrative. Comics artists enjoy a freedom of invention denied to those working in "fine arts" media such as painting and sculpture. They can move narrative through words, images or both, invent characters and voices, fine-tune their works' quotients of fantasy and social reference. Yet the visitor who looks at everything in "Fantastic!" will also come away with a new awareness of the conventions that bind cartoon artists. Only a few people here, such as the San Franciscan known as Mats!?, with his playable life-size board game "Skid-A-Go-Go" (2002), really burst those limits. 'FASTER THAN THE EYE' A related show called "Faster Than the Eye" fills Yerba Buena's huge central gallery. Absorption may be the deep link between "Faster" and the comics shows, for the four artists here contrive spectacles of intense illusionism. Visitors who enter Leandro Ehrlich 's "El Living" (2002) completely will feel themselves absorbed into it. A tidy but tacky furnished living room, hung with framed art posters and an electric clock, it appears to have two mirrors built into one wall, each reflecting the knickknacks on its sill. But the far mirror is missing something: the viewer's reflection. In fact it is an opening onto an identical room beyond the wall. Ehrlich's piece is unforgettable and might be seen as a joke about overidentification with home or possessions. But like the other works in "Faster" it invests enormous labor in one payoff moment.
