I've begun the process of gutting the car. As of last night, it is a bare chassis. The complete drivetrain, interior, and wiring harness have all been removed. As a result I'm selling my recently installed 6 Speed Conversion with 3.91 LSD: For Sale: Z3 6 Speed with 3.91 I also have a number of interior parts, sensors, heater core, etc if anyone needs them--just PM me. So I might get some grief for tearing apart such a rare car. I actually considered selling it and starting over with an S52 chassis, but I have too much development in this existing chassis (Suspension, Subframe Reinforcement, Half Cage, etc). Additionally, I'm getting good money for the low mileage S54, wiring harness, and ECU and I already have a pretty good ABS system with the DSC III MK20. The car is being built for C-Mod with BMW CCA Club Racing (I will also run GTS with NASA). Here are some highlights of the build: Fully built race motor (details TBA) ABS - MK20 Converted to Standalone Brakes - already been upgraded to Alcons on all for corners Suspension - I'm going to continue to run the GAZ 2-Way Remote Reservoir Coilovers that I installed earlier this year Chassis Wiring - I'm going to be building a custom harness using a 3 Cell kit for ISIS Power Engine Management - Currently evaluating options, but will definitely be standalone Engine Data Acquisition - Will be using a full compliment of sensor modules and guages from PLX Devices Performance Data Acquisition and Logging - Traqmate with TraqDash So please support this project and help make a Z3 M Coupe a front running in Club Racing by buying my transmission !

What class are you running in? I've got a motorhome as a tow vehicle and I'm setting my wife's expectations that I'm going to travel for a lot of races next year. If there are any Nation CR events near you, we'll get to run on track together. I've never seen two M Coupe race cars on the same track at the same time in the US. -bj Email Us Like Us Watch Us Reply With Quote Yesterday, 04:07 PM #4 PbFut View Profile View Forum Posts Visit Homepage Old Guy's Rule Join Date Jul 2005 Location Temecula Ca.

I run in JP, and Paul Kramer runs in CM (but it's really a IP car). I think Laguna Seca is almost always a National event... In addition, most of our events are with NASA, so pbfut brings out the V8 coupe as well... lets just say the coupe reputation as a race car is well regarded in these woods;-) Sincerely, Patrick Reply With Quote Today, 12:28 AM #6 bzaster View Profile View Forum Posts Member BMW CCA Member Join Date Apr 2005 Location Cali Posts 743 My Cars Z poop 3.0 Very cool!

I found a sheet of the material on ebay for around $150 shipped. It has a top layer of CF bonded to a layer of fiberglass. I used a non-M bumper, and traced the shape to match the lines of the bumper. The I cut it using a jig saw. I used black door protection moldings from autozone to clean up the leading edge. It has worked well and makes a perceivable difference. Now that the car is no longer streetable, I will use some stacked foam board to make an air dam to lower the splitter 2.5-3 inches. -bj Email Us Like Us Watch Us Reply With Quote Today, 02:56 PM #9 m50b20 View Profile View Forum Posts Member Join Date Apr 2008 Location Moscow, Russia Posts 49 My Cars 328'96, z3 Coupe 2.8'98 Can you tell MORE ab car modifications please ?
