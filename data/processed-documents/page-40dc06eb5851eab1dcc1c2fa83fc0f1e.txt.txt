In 1982, this facility was utilized as an auto repair center, and was equipped with the latest technology available at that time. Not long after we opened, we started building the body shop and towing divisions. It soon became apparent that we needed more room to grow each business, so we purchased a second parcel just half a mile down the road, at 99 th Ave & Grand. Now, in 2012, this facility has grown to include the body shop office and waiting area, 6 indoor work bays, the towing office and storage yard as well as 23 outside work bays. With our state-of-the-art equipment, we are able to perform any repair required, and to bring the vehicle back to factory specifications in a timely manner. We have partnered with DuPont so all of our paint work has a lifetime guarantee. We have also partnered with Enterprise and Hertz to make getting into and returning a rental as easy as possible. We offer customers a “Courtesy Shuttle” if they choose not to obtain a rental car, and provide both pick-up and drop-off services. At the end of the repair we offer rental drop service so there is no need to go to the rental company to return the rental vehicle. By having such a great partnership with our vendors and suppliers, it’s easy to go the extra mile to make both customers and insurance partners happy. An excellent staff makes the choice of partnership with Automotive Dynamics even easier. Automotive Dynamics is on the top tier with quality, cycle time, and overall appreciation from customer and insurance partners. All our techs are I-car Gold certified. A quality control check list on every repair ensures customers are happy and come-backs almost extinct. Our offices and customer lobby are clean, with complimentary refreshments. TESTIMONIALS Best place in Sun City to get your car repaired, Great to work with! Katie Great Job!
