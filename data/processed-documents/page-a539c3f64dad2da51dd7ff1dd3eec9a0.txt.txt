The following Sunday the church was all but empty. Accordingly, the pastor placed a notice in the local newspapers, stating that, because the church was dead, it was everyone's duty to give it a decent Christian burial. The funeral would be held the following Sunday afternoon. Morbidly curious, a large crowd turned out for the 'funeral'. In front of the pulpit they saw a closed coffin which was covered in flowers. After the priest had delivered the eulogy, he opened the coffin and invited his congregation to come forward and pay their final respects to their dead church. Filled with curiosity as to what would represent the corpse of a 'dead church', all the people eagerly lined up to look in the coffin. Each 'mourner' peeped into the coffin then quickly turned away with a guilty, sheepish look. In the coffin, tilted at the correct angle, was a large mirror. __________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity. - A.

'I brought Benjamin up in the faith, gave him a very expensive bar mitzvah; it cost me a fortune to educate him, then he tells me last week he has decided to be a Christian. Rabbi, where did I go wrong?' pleaded Menachim. 'Funny, Menachim, that you should come to me,' commented Rabbi Goldberg. 'Like you I, too, brought my boy up in the faith, put him through University; that cost me a fortune, then one day he, too, tells me he has decided to become a Christian.' 'What did you do?' inquired Menachim 'I turned to God for the answer,' replied the Rabbi. 'And what did He say?' pressed Menachim. 'God said, 'Funny you should come to me..........' __________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity. - A.

A minister was completing a temperance sermon. With great emphasis he said, 'If I had all the beer in the world, I'd take it and pour it into the river.' With even greater emphasis he said, 'And if I had All the wine in the world, I'd take it and pour it into the river.' And then finally, shaking his fist in the air, he Said, 'And if I had all the whiskey in the world, I'd take it and pour it into the river.' Sermon complete, he sat down... The song leader stood very cautiously and announced With a smile, nearly laughing, 'For our closing song, Let us sing Hymn #365, 'Shall We Gather at the River.'  Smile - life is too short not to!!  If this brightened your day Don't let it stop here Pass it on with a smile Keep spreading the Cheer.  See you at the river! Bring your own glass! __________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity. - A.

A Florida Court Sets Atheist Holy Day! Gotta love this Judge! You must read this...... A proper decision by the courts... for a change. A FLORIDA COURT SETS ATHEIST HOLY DAY  In Florida , an atheist created a case against Easter and Passover Holy days. He hired an attorney to bring a discrimination case against Christians and Jews and observances of their holy days. The argument was that it was unfair that atheists had no such recognized days. The case was brought before a judge. After listening to the passionate presentation by the lawyer, the judge banged his gavel declaring, Case dismissed!  The lawyer immediately stood and objecting to the ruling saying, Your honor, How can you possibly dismiss this case? The Christians have Christmas, Easter and others. The Jews have Passover, Yom Kippur and Hanukkah, yet my client and all other atheists have no such holidays...  The judge leaned forward in his chair saying, But you do. Your client, counselor, is woefully ignorant.  The lawyer said, Your Honor, we are unaware of any special observance or holiday for atheists. The judge said, The calendar says April 1st is April Fools Day. Psalm 14:1 states, 'The fool says in his heart, there is no God.' Thus, it is the opinion of this court, that, if your client says there is no God, then he is a fool. Therefore, April 1st is his day. Court is adjourned... You gotta love a Judge that knows his scripture! This is too good not to forward! __________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity. - A.

THE CHRISTMAS PAGEANT My husband and I had been happily married (most of the time) for five years but hadn't been blessed with a baby. I decided to do some serious praying and promised God that if he would give us a child, I would be a perfect mother, love it with all my heart and raise it with His word as my guide. God answered my prayers and blessed us with a son. The next year God blessed us with another son. The following year, He blessed us with yet another son. The year after that we were blessed with a daughter. My husband thought we'd been blessed right into poverty. We now had four children, and the oldest was only four years old. I learned never to ask God for anything unless I meant it As a minister once told me, If you pray for rain, make sure you carry an umbrella. I began reading a few verses of the Bible to the children each day as they lay in their cribs.. I was off to a good start. God had entrusted me with four children and I didn't want to disappoint Him. I tried to be patient the day the children smashed two dozen eggs on the kitchen floor searching for baby chicks. I tried to be understanding... when they started a hotel for homeless frogs in the spare bedroom, although it took me nearly two hours to catch all twenty-three frogs. When my daughter poured ketchup all over herself and rolled up in a blanket to see how it felt to be a hot dog, I tried to see the humor rather than the mess.. In spite of changing over twenty-five thousand diapers, never eating a hot meal and never sleeping for more than thirty minutes at a time, I still thank God daily for my children. While I couldn't keep my promise to be a perfect mother - I didn't even come close... I did keep my promise to raise them in the Word of God. I knew I was missing the mark just a little when I told my daughter we were going to church to worship God, and she wanted to bring a bar of soap along to wash up Jesus, too. Something was lost in the translation when I explained that God gave us everlasting life, and my son thought it was generous of God to give us his last wife. My proudest moment came during the children's Christmas pageant. My daughter was playing Mary, two of my sons were shepherds and my youngest son was a wise man. This was their moment to shine. My five-year-old shepherd had practiced his line, We found the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes. But he was nervous and said, The baby was wrapped in wrinkled clothes. My four-year-old Mary said, That's not 'wrinkled clothes,' silly. That's dirty, rotten clothes. A wrestling match broke out between Mary and the shepherd and was stopped by an angel, who bent her halo and lost her left wing. I slouched a little lower in my seat when Mary dropped the doll representing Baby Jesus, and it bounced down the aisle crying, Mama-mama. Mary grabbed the doll, wrapped it back up and held it tightly as the wise men arrived. My other son stepped forward wearing a bathrobe and a paper crown, knelt at the manger and announced, We are the three wise men, and we are bringing gifts of gold, common sense and fur. The congregation dissolved into laughter, and the pageant got a standing ovation. I've never enjoyed a Christmas program as much as this one, laughed the pastor, wiping tears from his eyes For the rest of my life, I'll never hear the Christmas story without thinking of gold, common sense and fur. My children are my pride and my joy and my greatest blessing, I said as I dug through my purse for an aspirin. ~~~~~ Jesus had no servants, yet they called Him Master. Had no degree, yet they called Him Teacher . Had no medicines, yet they called Him Healer. Had no army, yet kings feared Him. He won no military battles, yet He conquered the world. He committed no crime, yet they crucified Him. He was buried in a tomb, yet He lives today. Feel honored to serve such a Leader who loves us. ~~~~~ If you believe in God and in Jesus Christ His Son, send this to all on your buddy list. GOD BLESS YOU ALL!  __________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity. - A.

He sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more. The bartender approaches and tells the cowboy, You know, a mug goes flat after I draw it. It would taste better if you bought one at a time. The cowboy replies, Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in Arizona , the other is in Colorado . When we all left our home in Texas , we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together. So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself. The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. The cowboy becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way. He orders three mugs and drinks them in turn. One day, he comes in and only orders two mugs. All the regulars take notice and fall silent. When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss. The cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs. Oh, no, everybody's just fine, he explains, It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking. Hasn't affected my brothers though.  __________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity. - A.

Look at the picture above and you can see where this driver broke through the guardrail, on the right side of the culvert, where the people are standing on the road, pointing.... The pick-up was traveling about 75 mph from right to left when it crashed through the guardrail. It flipped end-over-end bounced off and across the culvert outlet, and landed right side up on the left side of the culvert, facing the opposite direction from which the driver was traveling.. The 22-year-old driver and his 18-year-old passenger were unhurt except for minor cuts and bruises. Just outside Flagstaff , AZ , on U.S. . Hwy 100. Now look at the second picture below...
