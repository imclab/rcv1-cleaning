Posted by Erin Coughlin , December 17, 2010 at 12:47 AM Comment Recommend  Flag as Inappropriate Loading...   x  Next Previous Slideshow Download There are two very different, popular approaches an artist can make when it comes to creating a work of art. There is the artist who relies on the sponenaouty of their own personal reactions. Then, there is the artist that maps out the slightest, most seemingly -though not- insignificant detail long before even a brush stroke or pencil line is applied to the canvas- or in this case, the computer screen.   Phancy Oil, graphic designer Ben Owens most recent collection of paintings, posters and sculpture on exhibit this month at proves that both art and humor is truly in the details.  The Creative Director of Phine Art Designs, Mr. Owens, successfully creates appealing, personal and humorous pieces by combining both his artistic and computer based talent. Owens credits his artistic inspiration to the numerous stuntshows and iconic happenings that he was not only fascinated by, but missed out on having been raised in upstate New York. Some artists that also fascinate and inspire him include the world famous Ralph Steadman, Mark Ryden and Todd Schorr.   As an artist, you have got to put in the time, gain experience, learn your stuff and make your own calls, said Owens. For a cold Thursday night, Toast was packed with wall to wall art enthusiasts and supporters discussing their own personal favorites over a glass of red wine and a pot of warm fondue. Two of the most popular items on display that evening inlcuded an acrylic painting  titled Capricornicus , and a grainy, western style poster featuring the words   Scottys Gun Liqour Porn 24 Hour Food Mart in bold type face above the illustration of a handgun pointed outwards. One by one, the enthusiastic crowd lined up to take turns inspecting another piece in his collection,-an old fashioned pharmacy rack-in order to read the intricately designed labels that Owens has meticulously wrapped around the various sized bottles and glass containers that rest on top of it. Looking even closer at the old fashioned pharmacutical - style labels, one couldnt help but notice that they were all humourously named after members of his close friends and family.  I wanted to- in a sense, give each member of my family their own show, said Mr. Owens. Accordion player Matt Dallow was the perfect addition to the carnival atmosphere of the evening, greeting guests with a wide grin and bursting into his own renditions of popular hits from The Beatles to Lady Gaga. Mr. Owens work will be on exhibit at Toast through out the holiday season.
