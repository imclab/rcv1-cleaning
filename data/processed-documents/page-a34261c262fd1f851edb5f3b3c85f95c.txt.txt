The Heroes star showed off her body art on The Graham Norton Show and revealed that the Italian phrase inked on her back means 'Live without regrets' - or it would if it wasn't misspelled. The blonde actress admits that she wasn't aware of the error until she visited Italy and the mistake was pointed out to her by locals - but she has managed to see the funny side. She says, "You know what? There may be an extra letter. It's in a different language though... Just advice: don't ever get a tattoo in a different language and then go to the country where they speak that language... It's a bad idea. "It means live without regrets (it's so ironic) and I literally have to live my life by my tattoo."
