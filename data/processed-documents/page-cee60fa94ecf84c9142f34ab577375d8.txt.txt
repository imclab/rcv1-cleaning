Join [?]  Latest Movie Hotties Headlines Hollywood Celebrity News Lily Collins gets on her hands and knees for Norway  Tweet 2 Comments So, maybe THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS: CITY OF BONES didn't do all that hot at the box office this weekend , but this is Norway for crying out loud! Those Norway-an peeps love them some fantasy (I'm an editor on Wikipedia for Norway, so I know what I'm talking about), so there's no doubt in my mind that the film will get the publicity and money it deserves. Anyway, here we can see Lily Collins... Continue Reading Hollywood Celebrity News Emmy Rossum spotted in low cut shirt and short black skirt Tweet 0 Comments Emmy Rossum is just one of those actresses that I feel we don't see enough of. Maybe that's because I hear about her once every six months or so. When you're a dignified Hollywood actress and pictures of you are rarer than Bigfoot sightings, I think it's easy to understand why I'm so upset. I don't know. Maybe I should go invest $10,000 in expensive lenses and a ridiculous camera and start... Continue Reading Hollywood Celebrity News Selena Gomez is in another sex-tastic dress at the Getaway premiere  Tweet 0 Comments After the craziness and irony of MTV hosting a music video award ceremony, stars and musicians alike have finally settled back into their lives. This includes, but is not limited to, the adorable Selena Gomez . Here she can be seen at the premiere of her new movie GETAWAY , where she plays a character who threatens Ethan Hawke with a gun. RightÂ I don't know if any of you have seen the...

Sad because some of us are going back to school, sad because parents wont be spending as much quality time with the kids, but saddest of all is that the opportunity to leer at beautiful women in swimsuits will soon be behind us. Well, Salacious is here to turn those tears into pervy... Continue Reading Hollywood Celebrity News Hot or Not: Jurnee Smollett-Bell  Tweet 7 Comments Done twerking with Miley? Done arguing over whether what Miley was doing at the VMAs this weekend actually qualified as twerking in the first place? Ready to slap yourself for knowing WTF twerking is in the first place? How about we move on from that and concentrate on another former child star whose up for debate in this week's Hot or Not. Jurnee Smollett-Bell I may not... Continue Reading Hollywood Celebrity News Do these glasses make Adrianne Curry look smarter at the Grandmaster premiere?  Tweet 2 Comments I'll admit that Adrianne Curry is far from being one of my personal favorite people. Much like that statement doesn't have a whole lot of sense when it comes to this post, neither does Curry's appearance at the Arclight Cinemas premiere of THE GRANDMASTER . She's not in the movie or involved with its making. I supposed she could be involved with one of the people who are/were/whatever,...

Not that I've heard anything good about the second season, I just know that it's available and I really liked the first season. In part because of the lead, Emily VanCamp as well as the rest of the cast, which happens to include the cute Christa B Allen (the actress is 22 in real...

I know, those are just fictional characters and actress Morena Baccarin is a real person in the mid-stages of her first pregnancy. I had to look at this photoshoot for L.A. Confidential magazine in order to see the minimal changes, but apparently that's what Morena is going for now that she's a regular... Continue Reading Hollywood Celebrity News Kelly Brook forgets her bikini top again  Tweet 2 Comments Don't get too excited though, since all I could find thus far are the censored images of Kelly Brook's topless, Turkish, tanning this weekend. That's okay though, because it's Kelly and that's enough. They really love their Kelly Brook down there in Turkey - almost as much as I do. She gets all kinds of bank to do promos for shit, like this sci-fi themed Axe Body Spray commercial we showed... Continue Reading Hollywood Celebrity News It was business as usual at the 2013 MTV VMAs last night  Tweet 17 Comments The attention whoring was breaking loose all over the place last night for the MTV Video Music Awards, both on stage and amidst the attendees. Remember when folks were having a shit fit about Madonna rolling around in lace underwear back in the 80s? Yeah, how quaint that was compared to Miley Cyrus' little "I'm so totally not a kid's star" slut fest. She and her...
