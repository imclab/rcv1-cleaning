BUT that was a real fluke. That rarely happens these days as automakers tend to keep their vehicles hidden under lock and key. The thing is this. Those photos appeared to have been shot over quite some distance. The new spy shots were shot at very close range and even though there's camouflage on this car, I think it's pretty clear to see where the styling is going for this vehicle. In addition, you get a full walkaround AND interior snaps as well. Looking at the exterior, nope, it won't take after it's 1-Series sibling. Rather than have those big, goofy eyes this car will get a more sporting and squinted look. The BMW trademark kidney front grills will be on the larger side and it appears the front valence will have pretty large intakes in the front valence to keep it breathing A-OK. If you're looking for a taste of what the interior will be like, you've come to the right place. Though the center stack remains to be seen, judging from the door panels and center console, the 2'er will remain Spartan in true BMW heritage. **Click Read Article to see the FULL series of shots!
