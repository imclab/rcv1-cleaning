By Jan Sjostrom  Daily News Arts Editor  You can’t help but love a couple like Georges and Albin. Kindhearted individuals and opposites in temperament, they’ve been devoted partners for 20 years. As played by George Hamilton and Christopher Sieber in the production of La Cage aux Folles at the Kravis Center, they’re bound to win your heart. True, Hamilton’s delivery is understated to the point of being uninflected, his singing wouldn’t win a Grammy, and, as he’s hampered by an injured Achilles tendon, his dancing is less than dazzling. But somehow the sincerity and warmth of his Georges shines through. Undoubtedly, Sieber’s Albin powers the show. He inhabits the role of the flamboyant drag queen with blazing radiance and touching humility. The couple’s romance is tested when Jean-Michel, Georges’ son by a short liaison, announces he’s getting married. He wants to invite his fiancee and her right-wing politician father and mother home to meet his parents. By parents, he doesn’t mean the outrageously effeminate Albin, who has been his doting surrogate mom for his entire life. Albin is to be packed off, while Georges, who owns the drag nightclub where Albin stars as ZaZa, pretends to be an acceptably straight parent. It’s all grounds for farcical humor that director Terry Johnson makes the most of, while retaining the human element in the central couple’s relationship. Sieber’s Albin is captivating, whether he’s hamming it up in a skimpy dress with false breasts or overcoming despair in the rousing Act 1 closer, I Am What I Am. Lynne Page’s spirited choreography and Matthew Wright’s eye-popping and witty costumes are shown to best advantage in the athletic antics of Les Cagelles, the club’s transvestite entertainers. Tim Shortall’s scenic design blends with Nick Richings’ lighting design to present striking stage pictures, such as the silhouettes of Les Cagelles framed with red light or a giant bird cage draped with suggestively posed Cagelles. Jerry Herman’s score and Harvey Fierstein’s book aren’t brilliant. But no matter. With its sweet protagonists and polished execution, this production transcends the show’s limitations to charm and entertain.
