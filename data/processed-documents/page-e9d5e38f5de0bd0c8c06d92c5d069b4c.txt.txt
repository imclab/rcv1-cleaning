The issue will be out next week! Shes gearing up for the season premiere of ABCs Revenge and during promotions, Emily VanCamp scored the cover spot on NYLON magazines September 2013 issue. While rocking a few poses in designer duds from Heather Bell and Topshop for the Jason Nocito-shot spread, the 27-year-old actress dished about her successful series and reveals her constant struggles with the pesky paparazzi. On Revenge: They couldve hired someone with a bigger name and banked on that. They took a chance on me, and its brought on a whole new collection of opportunities. On being chased by the shutterbugs : It should be illegal for people to stalk you with the cameras. Its really invasive. How do you enjoy a moment? I see how people spiral out of control. On her girl next door reputation: I wouldnt have labeled myself that way. I just think I had the look to play those characters. I was a good kid, but I definitely had my moms of rebellion.
