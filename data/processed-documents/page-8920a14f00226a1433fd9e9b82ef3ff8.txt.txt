AV Categories: Should Arts and Literature/Books be separate categories? Asked by  Max20characters 33 months ago              Similar Questions: AV Categories Arts Literature Books separate categories    Recent Questions About: AV Categories Arts Literature Books separate categories Arts  Books  Answers     Answer from Predator    2 people found this helpful  Of course. In my opinion, ALL of the "*X & X" are very poor pairings. In addition, the categories the Team chose to use (paired or unpaired) are wholly inadequate, leaving a lot of Questions that can't be classified into any of them!

I find it particularly weird to click on ARTS and see endless requests for books someone read about "a boy and a girl" written in the 80's (they think) but they can't remember..... Arts and visual arts are stuck in this mess.  Max20characters 33 months ago  Was Predator's answer helpful?      Answer from danielpauldavis    3 people found this helpful  Technically, literature IS an "art" in itself. Have a category of "Arts and Literature" is telling everyone that literature is not an art but something else (what, then?) The principal category should be ART. Under that, Literature, Painting, Sculpture, Ceramics, Fabric/Sewing, Warhol, etc. danielpauldavis 33 months ago  danielpauldavis danielpauldavis Loading stats... Loading awards... Loading...

In this case books would be a better category since there is very little reference to actual literature in the purest sense. And there are so many questions about books that they overwhelm any references to the visual arts. By your definition, of course, Entertainment, movies and music should all fall under ARTS. As for fabric and sewing that usually would be under Hobbies and Crafts or vice versa. Since you are defending the current paradigm, why are there separate Major Category listings for Entertainment, Movies, and Television? Your argument is fine if we were discussing classical definitions but that's not the case here. Max20characters 33 months ago  Was danielpauldavis's answer helpful?      Answer from MusicLoverMe    2 people found this helpful  Yes, definitely! There should be categories for different genres IMO, i.e., literary fiction, non-fiction, romance, horror, mystery, etc. That would eliminate rummaging through all the listings unnecessarily to find one that may be interesting.

Rarely are there book discussions just questions asking if anyone know the title of some book they read in the 80's or 90's (with a red cover no less). The book questions are overwhelming the other topics under ART and need to be put in a separate category. I'd just make that category "Books" since most questions are about teen level books or Romance Novels. Not too many people are asking us to analyze the charger of Portia, in The Merchant of Venice. Traditionally, "The Arts" is a topic that includes a broad range of creative subjects such as painting, sculpture, now graphic arts, theater, film (movies), photography, music, literature. In contrast the single word "ART" has referred to the visual arts, not the whole enchalada. In addition, they have repetitive topics like Entertainment, Movies and Television as Main Categories but they bury all visual arts under a mountain of questions about pulp books. Personally, I think if you're not following any traditional rules anyway, Visual Arts, Books, Music (definitely), Movies and Television, and maybe Entertainment should all be separated.

Max20characters 33 months ago  Was MusicLoverMe's answer helpful?      Answer from Yellowdog    1 people found this helpful  I am looking for a book but I don't know the title or author. It's about a boy and a girl who meet at a homecoming dance. He is a Vampire and she is studying to be a Vampire Slayer. They break up when they discover this but have to team up together because the Zombies are planning to attack, so they learn that each other aren't really that bad. Seems like they fall in love again. But an evil wizard named Morlock the Warlock tries to stop them. That's all I remember ... Yellowdog 33 months ago  Yellowdog Yellowdog Loading stats...
