September 2012 BY  TONY SWAN Suzukis press conference was the curtain-raising act of the 2012 Paris auto show , and this demure compact crossover was its headliner. Suzuki hasnt had much in the way of new-product news lately, particularly in the U.S., but according to global sales managing officer Kenichi Ayukawa, the S-Cross will mark the beginning of a wave of launches that will proceed at a rate of one per year in Europe for the next few years. Speculation had the production S-Cross as the likely replacement for the SX4 hatchback , but its likely going to join the lineup alongside that diminutive all-wheel driver. Might whatever the S-Cross becomes be enlisted to shore up Suzukis rapidly fading U.S. fortunes? Lets defer the answer to that proposition for a bit later. Limited Specs First, lets check the specs, an exercise that wont take much time because Suzuki didnt provide very many. Basically a typical front-drive crossover design with all-wheel-drive capability, the S-Cross rides a 102.4-inch wheelbase and is 169.7 inches long. Width is 72.4 inches, and height is 63.0 inches. Thats at the smallish end of the compact-class scale, although its a size that makes sense for European and Asian markets.  Aside from those basic dimensions, though, the S-Cross is a bit of a mystery. Beyond a passing mention of all-wheel drive, there was no discussion of the powertrain, for example. The obvious guess is a four-cylinder engine and a choice of manual or automatic transmissions. Output is another unknown, but given Suzukis penchant for keeping price and operating costs low, wed bet on modest. Like other players in this segment, Suzuki undoubtedly will aim high on fuel economy. We think. Image a Reality Check The exterior design is not unpleasant, with its sinusoidal character line down the side, and the front skid plate and 20-inch chrome wheels add a soupon of macho to the matrix. Were told the cargo hold is generous by class standards, and that the cars features and functions are designed primarily for comfort. Suzuki also claims the concepts Crystal Green Metallic exterior evokes an image of nature in the city and the city in nature. Aside from someone getting hellaciously lost and parking their S-Cross on a Central Park sidewalk, were not sure how that works. While we pondered that possibility, we cornered Mr. Ayukawa and asked whether wed see the S-Cross in U.S. showrooms. Mr. Ayukawa refrained from eye contact, looking down at his notes before answering: At this moment, he replied cautiously, we have no plans. In the future we will see. OK.
