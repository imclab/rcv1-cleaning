Amid the buzz for last month's Shanghai auto show, ads for a single car papered entire subway stations in this city of 19 million people. Outside a luxury hotel, an employee nearly cried as she took photos of a red Ferrari. Oh, it's beautiful! she exclaimed. Auto plants throughout China, with potted bamboo or fish tanks in break areas, are viewed as essential to the development of smaller cities of a million or more people. After a decade of double-digit annual sales growth, excepting one year, light-vehicle sales in China topped 17 million last year. While that represented a 33 percent year-over-year increase, it was smaller than the 48 percent surge in 2009. Still, China's growth is slowing. Government actions held growth in the first quarter to about 8 percent, compared with a 20 percent increase in the recovering U.S. market, where sales haven't hit 17 million since 2001. Last year, U.S. sales were a below-average 11.6 million. For Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group, which are still getting established in China, the slowing market means they largely missed out on a stretch of record growth, and, in some cases, profits. Chrysler is leaning on a small business importing Jeeps, while its part owner Fiat is introducing its 500 minicar in China this year and won't have a locally built car to sell until next year. Ford's 2010 light-vehicle share was 3.4 percent. We could have gone faster and should have gone faster in China, said Joe Hinrichs, CEO of Ford China. For General Motors Co., whose sales in China last year made up 28 percent of its worldwide volume, the slowdown might mean a chance to catch its breath. After having doubled its sales in two years, GM is planning to take five years to accomplish the feat again. China's governments has deliberately slowed the country's auto binge by cutting off incentives, twice increasing gas prices and limiting license plate registrations in congested Beijing. China's annual sales growth is expected to hover around 5 percent to 15 percent for the next several years, likely marking an end to the kind of year-over-year sales explosion automakers recently enjoyed. The more normal growth will still offer millions of additional buyers every year and will about double the overall market in the next decade. As the global auto market struggled to recover from its recent recession, China thrived, partially because of the government's new-car subsidies that are ending. In addition, the government of Beijing implemented a lottery system this year to limit new license plates to 20,000 a month, or about one-third the number of passenger cars registered in 2010. A similar system is in place in Shanghai. People bid each month for the amount they're willing to pay for a plate. The average bid had been 20,000 to 30,000 yuan--roughly $3,000 to $5,000 -- but this month hit a record high of nearly $7,300. The highest offers win, and the losers must try again. Until bidders get a plate, they can't drive the new cars they've bought. Some get plates from other provinces, but they risk getting pulled over if they drive in the many areas designated Shanghai-only plates. more from business Founder Richard Schulze plans to reduce his stake in Best Buy Casino supporters press Walker on reservation plan Wal-Mart expands benefits to domestic partners get related content delivered to your inbox You are now subscribed. manage my email subscriptions 0 comments resize text print buy reprints Tweet share email Email share your name your email recipients email + add a comment add a comment   from the homepage Tempers flare as temp rises in Twin Cities; fair numbers down US readies intelligence, rationale for possible Syria strike Report: Josh Willingham placed on trade waivers by Twins ADVERTISEMENT  Most read Most Emailed Most Watched <500){e=new Date;}">Mounting tensions with Syria sink US stocks <500){e=new Date;}">Founder Richard Schulze plans to reduce his stake in Best Buy <500){e=new Date;}">Polished pitchmen – and their wares – are popular fare at the fair <500){e=new Date;}">Calif city looks to seize loans to ease mortgages <500){e=new Date;}">New Hope's Sealed Mindset aims to grow <500){e=new Date;}">Minnesota effort targets weeds as energy crops <500){e=new Date;}">Heat blast sends corn, soybean prices up <500){e=new Date;}">Target has a twin in Australia, but they're not related <500){e=new Date;}">Minnesota effort targets weeds as energy crops  <500){e=new Date;}">StribCast: Back to school in the heat <500){e=new Date;}">Adrian Peterson visits Children's Hospital <500){e=new Date;}">StribCast: Expect another scorcher today <500){e=new Date;}">C.J.: Untold story of FOX 9 anchor's pregnancy <500){e=new Date;}">Step right up!
