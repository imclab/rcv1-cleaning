Car repair philosophy To call car repairing a philosophy seems a bit funny. But like any job you want to do properly, it's best if you know what your doing all the way through. In our site, we give emphasis on drivers helping themselves and making safe minor or major car repair. For reasons of safety and more quality repair we appeal to all our visitors, if they can and want, to widen there knowledge about cars, car systems and how they work, both single and combined together. So, our very first advice to you is, if you want to do some repairs, learn more about your car and the car systems. There's no quality car repair without knowing the basics about the car systems. The car is a machine that is made out of various different systems, that combined together, give the possibility of driving. For example, it doesn't hurt, while doing a rather simple task ( like changing the air filter ) to know what's it's purpose, what it's connected to and so on. .
