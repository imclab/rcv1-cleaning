The Ojai Bubble July 2010 issue is at Ojai Printing and will be out and around in a few days. The issue is themed around French Connections to Ojai, in light of Bastille Day on July 14, and the French Festival in Santa Barbara on July 17 and 18. To view a small sampling of what is within, visit The Ojai Bubbleâs Facebook page. With 28 pages of articles, photographs and poems, it is not only thicker than Volume 1; it is more consistent visually, while still playful and colorful. Perhaps Steve Grumette enhancing my photos, and having three professional photographers contribute are the reasons the pages look so pretty. And, as I received a suggestion here, a suggestion there, from Anca Colbert, my daughter Ivy Anderson, P. Lyn Middleton, Myrna Cambianica, and others, I grew in the graphics role.

A performance where the energy is just right, the lyrics are inspirational, and the performer is happy to be alive and share? Joe Reilly is that performer and he'll be in Ojai on Tuesday performing in the Soul Centered dome at 7pm. Tickets at the door. Joe Reilly's heart is an infinite ocean and each song that he writes is a resonant wave. We call him Spiritboy because when he aligns his hands, his heart, and his harmonies, he not only displays his personal emotional journey, he also plucks the heartstrings of hope to bring us beyond despair into healing action. His heart has been nurtured by Native American, Buddhist, and Catholic teachings. As a result, he can howl a chilling splash-in-the face blues about treachery and historical injustice and inspire you with upbeat ditties that echo in your mind long afterwards. Joe is from Michigan and this will be his second pass through Ojai. In the years I've known Joe, I've discovered that he is gentle, kind, loving, musical, creative, and fun. His music his perfect for kids of all ages and most who leave wanting more. Listen to select tracks.

Warmly placed between what turned out to be veteran Festival goers, we patiently waited for the program to begin. A middle-aged man emerged to polite applause, plunked himself before the impressive Steinway and began to play.

There are two theatre events this weekend that I'd like to recommend. Two gay-themed plays being performed this weekend and I urge you to see them both. The first to tell you of is Corpus Christi by Terrence McNally. In the 1990's there were three notable plays by gay authors. I had the good fortune of being in two of them. Jeffrey by Paul Rudnick and Angels in America by Tony Kushner. Jeffrey, an Off-Broadway sex romp and Angels, an 8-hour gay fantasia on national themes, both had long runs and critical acclaim. Terrence McNally didn't fair as well. He got death threats for the 1998 production of Corpus Christi. More notable for the furor from the religious right than for it's artistic success, it opened to less than glowing reviews. It has been revived over the years in various productions with better success than the original and comes to Ojai this weekend courtesy of Ojai's own John Grant and 108 Productions. The troupe is on the last legs of a tour that began in 2008 and will end this Spring in San Francisco. They're traveling with a documentary film crew, so it will be nice to have Ojai included in the mix. Speaking of Jeffrey, that is my connection to the actor in Theater 150's Solo Series presentation of Bent to the Flame. I met the playwright and actor Doug Tompos on Jeffrey. He was assigned to teach me the roles I would be taking over. Years later we worked catering in Los Angeles and I've not seen him for sometime until last Saturday's matinÃ©e. Bent to the Flame tells us the story of a young Tennessee Williams, fresh on the heels of his success with A Glass Menagerie, as he is prepares to address an audience gathered to hear a lecture on the work of a controversial gay poet. Doug gave a wonderful performance. The only complaint I have about the production is that there were only 4 people in the audience!!

This evening our City Council members will be deliberating on applicants for the vacancy created by the resignation of Joe DeVito last month. While appointing a fifth member to the council is a serious matter, I anticipate some humorous small town drama. For those new to city meetings, they are held at Ojai City Hall, 401 S. Ventura Street. Meetings start at 7:30 p.m. This Item, "Appointment to City Council to Fill Unexpired Term," is number four on the agenda, so it might be after 8 p.m. before it comes up. I recommend arriving on time, if you can, so that you get your bearings, especially if you plan to speak at the podium for the candidate of your choice. Delicious Pepperidge Farm cookies, coffee, assorted herbal teas and spring water are available in the city hall kitchen to add to the small-town friendliness of the meeting and to help keep you awake when things get bogged down. I have also been known to take home a handful of chocolate lady fingers to ease the pain of disappointment at the outcome -- or to celebrate small victories -- as the case may be. WARNING: The coffee at city hall is real. This is not your low-caffeine-organic type brand. I drank it once and immediately felt a terrific jolt to my nervous system -- got the shakes and was up all night. Back to the matter at hand: As of this morning, five brave souls have applied for the position.

Over the course of the last three years a new strategic plan was developed and executed to expand the festival and attract wider audiences and serve a broader geographic area within Ventura County. As a result the festival expanded into Ventura, formed strategic partnerships with the Ojai Valley Inn & Spa and Brooks Institute, began the Celebrity Golf Classic, changed its name to the Ojai-Ventura International Film Festival, and for the first time attracted very capable and committed directors & officers from outside of Ojai. Additionally, many new donors, sponsors & advertisers signed-on with the festival and enabled the expansion into new venues, expanded special events and screenings, and the festival attracted the best films in its history. A relationship with the British Academy of Film & Television Arts (BAFTA) was formed along with many other special and meaningful relationships.

[Posted here is the updated, second version] Austin said, âI just liked the idea of Chalica as a fresh new thing.â Could there be a copyright issue in emulating Sandlerâs song? âItâs just four guitar chords repeated over and over,â he noted.

In contrast, men who voted for the winner, Democrat Barack Obama, had stable testosterone levels immediately after the outcome. Female study participants showed no significant change in their testosterone levels before and after the returns came in.

From this distance, it looks just like the several-hundred-pound black bear that I first discovered in the same position, on the same branch, last Saturday morning. But it is not him. It is a 70-pound metal sculpture created by my neighbor, Mark Benkert , honoring the memory of the bear. The following video tells the story of how it got there.

Stefano and Tammi have made some changes to the layout of the restaurant space to allow for a few more seats and created a fantastic rustic northern Italian menu (Stefano is from the region between Venice and Verona). Bill and I dined at Osteria Monte Grappa last night and were thrilled (ecstatic actually) to have another quality dining option in the Ojai Valley. Itâs also refreshing to see experienced restaurateurs at the helm. And, they brought one of their top chefs (Cesar) from Pane E Vino. The menu is reasonably priced with countless offerings, including plenty of vegetarian options. The bambinos also have their own menu. We found the space to be a bit cramped and hot and the sloped floor an odd curiosity (our beverages were definitely tilting precariously in our neighborâs direction).

Those of you who were around when the high school was first established in 1909 will recall that our whole town was once called Nordhoff, and that is how the high school got its name. But in 1916, a group called the anti-Nordhoffians, with the help of the manager of the Foothills Hotel, Mr. Morse, convinced a hopelessly divided town to convert from "Nordhoff" to the new name, "Ojai."

"Left home at the age of seven/one year later I'm carryin' an Ak-47." For hip hop artist Emmanuel Jal, a former child soldier in Sudan's brutal civil war, these lyrics are hardly empty posturing. They are the bitter reality of a young man who was "forced to sin" but determined to "never give up and never give in." Today, wounded but still hopeful, he fights a new battle: bringing peace to his beloved Sudan and building schools in Africa. This time, his weapon is a microphone. See why audiences from New York to Berlin to London rave about the award-winning film, War Child, and have embraced the hip-hop artist with a terrifying past and a gentle soul. Interspersing original interviews, live concerts, and rare footage of Jal as a seven year-old boy, War Child will make viewers cry, laugh, dance, and celebrate the power of hope.

Damage to our air quality is one of the reasons the Coalition has been opposed to gravel trucks traveling through the Ojai Valley on their way from the Cuyama valley to Oxnard and Ventura. Ojai has what is known as a "closed" air shed, which means that pollutants collect here in the valley and remain trapped. Despite appearances that might suggest otherwise, Ojai has some of the worst air quality in the County. Scientists have demonstrated that the link between diesel fume exposure and cancer lies in the ability of diesel exhaust to induce the growth of new blood vessels that serve as a food supply for solid tumors.

The virtuosity and ferocity of his playing led to his being described as âthe Jimi Hendrix of the pipesâ, and his style has continued to mature in the intervening years as he has pursued a solo career. Generally acknowledged as the most accomplished uilleann piper performing today, he is certainly one of the most brilliant musicians of his generation.

Enjoy! Anatomy of an Exhibit What occurs behind the scenes building an exhibit? Obviously there is talent, but in addition there is a lot of work and passion. Take for instance the current Ojai Valley Museum exhibit, âMAD About Sergio.â The seed was planted when Bobbie Boschan, Vice President of the Museum Board of Trustees met Sergio AragonÃ©s two years ago at the former location of Artful Living.

Suza and her first yoga teacher, Sarah Kirton, who is described in Yoga for People Over 50, (1977). The first thing my 90-year old student asked me while she was on the floor stretching her legs was, "Do you have a boyfriend?" "Oh my God," I thought, "It just never ends. Romance will always be more interesting than the rest of life." I like to pry into the lives of my students as much as they like to pry into mine. After forty years of teaching, in every setting and every sort of circumstance, I can safely say that nothing is as it seems. In the course of a typical month I make the rounds all over the valley, from picture-perfect estates in Rancho Matilija, the top of Foothill, Thacher, McAndrew and high up Sulphur Mountain Road in Upper Ojai, to more modest homes in the hills of Krotona, to humble apartments and small family houses on the valley floor, and even old "shacks" that are falling apart and going back to the Earth.

Otto lived and potted in the east end of Ojai, among the towering old oak trees, and near acres of orange orchards. He had a gallery/store called The Pottery, in front of his home and studio, and it was open most afternoons, for anyone interested to wander through, either on the honor system, or with a friend helping out there.

Saturday, July 25th at 4:30pm, Ojai Theater will be the local premiere of the film, "Mad City Chickens," a wacky and wonderful documentary about one Wisconsin city's "chicken underground" fighting city hall to make their poultry passion legal. This is a film you don't want to miss, even if you don't eat eggs or have a hankering for feathered friends. You will laugh out loud and even Sci-Fi and Twilight Zone fans will appreciate the style of the film. One thing's for sure, if you've been on the fence about getting chickens, you'll be convinced to join the growing ranks of home farmers who are committed to a more sustainable food system and to make happy hens a part of your life. After the film we'll be having a chat with Garm Beall, founder of the website backyardchickens.com about how to get started raising chickens with Q at the Village Jester pub next door. This is a fundraiser ($10) for the Food & Agriculture Committee of the Ojai Valley Green Coalition, so that we can plant more vegetable gardens for folks and conduct more culinary events.

First he spoke to a SRO crowd at the Krotona Institute where he eloquently reminded us of the perennial wisdom, the oneness of all life, and not to identify too much with the various roles we play in this world. For one fleeting moment I almost felt enlightened. I "got it" when he said, "Life is not only stranger than you think, it is stranger than you CAN think." After the Krotona event, Deepak gave a talk to an intimate gathering at the Ojai Retreat. I got lucky and was invited to dinner with him and his wife at the Ranch House. The next day he did a booksigning at Local Hero before being whisked away to a series of events in Los Angeles where he spoke before an audience of several thousand. I'm sure Deepak has his flaws like all human beings, but I am impressed by his astute observations on the human condition. I just finished reading his compassionate tribute to Michael Jackson on the Huffington Post, and felt moved to post it here. A Tribute to My Friend, Michael Jackson "Michael Jackson will be remembered, most likely, as a shattered icon, a pop genius who wound up a mutant of fame. That's not who I will remember, however. His mixture of mystery, isolation, indulgence, overwhelming global fame, and personal loneliness was intimately known to me. For twenty years I observed every aspect, and as easy as it was to love Michael -- and to want to protect him -- his sudden death yesterday seemed almost fated.

Hello Chris - I've finally read your email regarding how the Coalition might obtain a full year's worth of weigh tickets from the Ozena Ranch Mine facility. Obviously - the "evidence" you've collected is entirely insufficient. I've turned your email over to our attorney -- for I do not have the legal skills to know how to go from here. Naturally - I view your email not only with great disappointment - but I also see it as one more example of how the Planning Division does not wish to let genuine evidence come to light by conveniently hiding behind a rather poorly collected and insufficient randsom sample of Ozena weight tickets. I'm not that naieve, Chris, to believe that if you and your other colleagues really wished to collect a full year's data that you would certainly be able to do so. The fact that you aren't willing to do that speaks volumes: You fear the TRUTH and simply can't handle the TRUTH. We'll have to seek another legal remedy to get to the bottom of this.

Casa Barranca specializes in organic wine, and Old Creek has some wonderful Mediterranean styles. We also have Movino , where Buddy Wilds serves up glasses of intriguing varieties, like Earthquake Zin or Caymus Conundrum, when heâs not up on the stage or coiffing a hair-do or two. And over at the Ojai Beverage Co. , Jorge and Joby have daily tastings to tempt any palate, and 1000 bottles to choose from.

What have you tasted lately thatâs got you swooning over the grape?

When Lindberg learned that Ojai was mounting its own campaign push, she stepped forward with the donation. As soon as McCluer saw it, she had to have it, her husband said.

The album is sort of bluegrass chamber music. It's a fascinating listen. I'm also enjoying the last Nickel Creek album "Why Should The Fire Die?," which I never got around to buying when it came out in 2005. I picked up both albums this weekend on iTunes. I've also been playing with the Pandora app on my iPhone. You pick an artist you like, and it starts streaming songs you can give a thumbs up or thumbs down to, and as it learns your preferences, it builds out essentially a radio station. I have a few channels set up, including ones based on Old Crow Medicine Show, Moby and Mother Hips.

Al has been a very close friend of mine since 1983. Many of you met him at past Ojai Rock Fest shows. He performed as "Maggie's Pa" as well as helping put on the production of many of these events. Al died while doing what he loved best....playing music. He was performing at a Retirement Home when he passed out and later died of a massive heart attack. Al was the person who got me to come to Ojai almost 6 years ago by helping me land a great job. He was the one who went with me to the doctor when I was first diagnosed with Cancer, and then went on to organize a benefit to help me pay the mound of expenses I was to incur. He was a true friend. Everyone who met Al always liked him. He made people smile. He had a great sense of humor, and was extremely charitable, even down to his dying minute. It was a pleasure knowing you Al, you'll be greatly missed!

I am pleased to pass on this announcement of the first general meeting of the Ojai Valley Poetry Association : Hello Poets and Festivilians, We were all shocked and dismayed (although not entirely surprised, considering the current economic climate) to hear that the festival committee had to cancel the intended program for the 2009 Ojai Poetry Festival. Nevertheless, a few of us optimistic souls met at the library and vowed to continue the good work of Festival co-founders Jim Lenfestey, Linda Silver, and Gael Belden--albeit in a new incarnation. To that end, John Kertis formed the Ojai Valley Poetry Association (OVPA), an unincorporated, non-profit entity under the auspices of the Ojai Valley Library Friends & Foundation, to oversee potential fundraising and organization of this year's festival. The current five-member board consists of myself, John Kertis, Liz Grumette, Dave Ray and Phil Taggart. We're sending out a call to old and new friends of poetry to meet on Wednesday, January 21 at 7 p.m. at the Ojai Library to discuss the new agenda, new line-up possibilities and fund-raising potential. Volunteers are needed to design and manage all aspects of the Festival. All are welcome to the conversation. Please pass the word.

Today is the last day of Chalica , a seven-day celebration of the principles that underlie the Unitarian Universalist movement, beginning on the first Monday in December. Like all holy-days, it was conceived by a person to meet a need; in this case is was a woman named Daylene Marshall from British Columbia, who a few years ago decided that a winter holiday to honor the UU principles would be a community-building and unifying thing. Chalica continues to grow grassroots-style, with people discovering and creating it every year. The general practice is to light a chalice (or candle) in one's home each day in honor of one principle, and to give gifts or take actions that further it. Part of its beauty for me is that, just as one needn't be a Christian to celebrate Christmas, you don't have to identify as a Unitarian Universalist to appreciate and celebrate these ideals! The seven principles are: 1. The inherent worth and dignity of every person; 2. Justice, equity and compassion in human relations; 3. Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations; 4. A free and responsible search for truth and meaning; 5. The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large; 6. The goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all; 7.

He took us up to the 80-acre Ilvento Preserve, the first property the OVLC acquired in 1997. I last went on this 2-mile hike with the OVLC in the spring of 2006 to write a story for the Sierra Clubâs local paper, and although the wildflower sightings were abundant, so, too, were the ticks. This time, the dry weather kept the ticks away, but Rick took the time to give his now famous Tick Talk, which served to give us all the willies. About a mile into the hike are some of the most spectacular views in the valley. I snapped this photo of Rick with my cell phone at the preserveâs highest point, 2024 feet, offering views of Lake Casitas and, on clear days, the Pacific.

At the time, many didnât take the legal threat very seriously, but based on two motions filed this week in U.S. District Court in California, the McCain campaign sure does. The second filing is...an anti-SLAPP motion, which is typically used by defendants as a way to seek monetary damages after a plaintiff has subjected a defendant to a lawsuit meant to chill free speech. So far, McCain is only looking for attorneyâs fees and costs, but claiming an artist has interfered with free speech is quite the poke of an eye in show business.

Comment #10 Posted by: another anonymousâ* This afternoon as I crossed the street to go into the post office I noticed that the Ojai Theatre marquee still announced the Ojai Film Festival. It's Monday, another work week and our attention moves on to upcoming events. But this year's film festival marks the beginning of a new direction for the festival. OFF treasurer Bill Monot in opening statements before Saturday night's gala event noted that the festival happened during this worsening financial climate. I don't know what the numbers are as far as attendance. There were many screenings that were not very well attended.

The vibration created by the mine's trucks on SR-33 may be adding significantly to the problem of road slippage, slumps, and slides.

(Trucks passes through town on Ojai Ave & Montgomery, photo credit to Ray Smith, Daly Road Graphics) In documents recently obtained by the Ojai "Stop the Trucks" through a Ventura County Public Records Request, the Coalition has learned that Ozena wants to alter their existing permit so that trucking through the Ojai Valley will begin as early as 3:00 am and continue as late as 6:00 pm during the week with "No Route Restrictions" at all on Saturdays! This proposal would more than double trucking from a total of seven hours a day during the week to a new and even more intrusive and disturbing 15 hours a day! In a recent review of weigh tickets from 2007, the "Stop the Trucks" Coalition estimated that Ozena is likely now violating existing permit hours in trips through Ojai by as much as 55%. In a letter to "Stop the Trucks," County CEO, Ms. Marty Robinson, agreed with the Coalition that violations have been under reported by the Planning Division. In a further review of emails obtained through that same Records Request, we found that the agent for Ozena, John Hecht of West Coast Environmental & Engineering, rejected the consultant the County originally selected, URS, because: "...the proposed costs did not appear in line to the anticipated scope of work. Ozena believes that a competitive process will provide a qualified CEQA contractor in a more cost effective manner."

"The facts speak for themselves." "Complaints about the system from developers and property owners are nothing new..." " But this time, the county is listening and often agreeing..." "Last year, the county commissioned a report on its land-use procedures by Tom Berg, a consultant who once held (Chris) Stephens' current position as Resource Management Agency director. Based on interviews with 75 people in and out of county government, Berg's report concluded that the land-use process was in need of "systemic changes."

September 11, 2008 at the Ventura County Maritime Museum 2731 S. Victoria Avenue Oxnard, CA 93035 5:30 p.m. -7:30 p.m. (Reception with appetizers and no-host bar 5:30-6:30, presentation 6:30-7:30) Cost: $15 members, $20 non-members During the Opening Ceremonies for the Olympics, China celebrated the achievements of the great navel fleets of the Ming Dynasty, events hardly known or recounted in the West. By 1405 China had been a powerful empire for nearly two thousand years. The crown jewels of Emperor Zhu Diâs navy were his Treasure boats. These behemoths, nearly half the size of World War II aircraft carriers, were largest wooden sailing ships ever built. And although the wealth they carried back to China was staggering, it created conflict between the two factions that served the emperor; the Military and the Mandarin bureaucrats. After the emperorâs death, the chief Mandarin sought to undermine the power of his foes by decreeing that the fleets be grounded, the records destroyed and overseas trade forbidden. The result crippled China for the next 600 years - a decline that is only being reversed today as witnessed during the Olympics.

If true this would a clear violation of local road and traffic regulations. While we await further confirmation, here is Ray's first person report: " I spotted another truck near my home. Apparently, they are coming from Santa Paula, but instead of going through downtown via Ojai Avenue, they cut north to Grand Avenue. They head east, turn onto West Summer St., then south on Canada to pick up Ojai Avenue again. This is the third time I've seen one do this.

El Roblar Drive in Meiners Oaks . Well known around the county and beyond as the lead singer for blues outfit Baby Sister and soul/funk band Soul Star Express, April is forging ahead with a brand new sound combining elements of soul, blues, rock, funk and hip hop. She has been hard at work writing songs with partners from across the musical spectrum and now has assembled a smoking hot band to deliver her sound to the world. Anchored by bassist Aron Von Alstine and drummer Greg Weiser, her band includes local favorites Sunny Erickson on guitar and David Gorospe on keys, both members of the popular funk groove band Euphoria. The daughter of a professional backup singer, April Hendrix comes from a strong musical lineage. Besides her famous cousin Jimi, her uncles âSpudâ and Jerome Hendrix were stalwarts of many Ventura county bands. Often traveling with her mother on the road, Aprilâs earliest memories of performing are in the backseat of the car, singing along with her motherâs demo tapes. But Sharon âMuffyâ Hendrix made her daughter promise she would get an education before she pursued a music career. So April found a way to do both.

'When they're coming through at 2:30 or 3 a.m., and you're sleeping, it gets pretty loud,' Walker said during a recent interview at his home, just north of Ojai on Highway 33. 'At one point, it was an everyday thing.'" â¦But many Ojai residents still chafe at what they see as enough truck traffic to turn their bucolic city into a loud, smoggy, congested mess. Ventura County (Planning Division), they say, has ignored their concerns. Walker filed three complaints against one mining company, starting in 2005, and said the county never acknowledged any of them until a few months ago.

This is just in from the NY Times website: June 17, 2008 Oregon woman plans to parade topless on July 4 By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Filed at 6:51 p.m. ET ASHLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A woman seen frequently in Ashland riding topless on her bicycle says she plans to be in Ashland's Fourth of July parade free and independent of all clothing but a hemp G-string. The Chamber of Commerce says that's contrary to the rules for the family celebration. She says she'll sue if she can't parade as she wishes. Jen Moss has been known as ''The Naked Lady'' since she moved to Ashland in May from Ojai, Calif., drawn by the town's nudity laws. They specify only that people must cover their genitalia in a city park or the downtown commercial district, which means Moss need not cover her breasts. The police in California, she says, harassed her when she rode her bicycle wearing a G-string and pasties. Moss applied for an entry for the parade, which draws thousands each year. The Ashland Chamber of Commerce learned of her coverage plans from an online posting. She promised to lead in-line skaters ''wearing only a hemp G-string and blowing a conch shell.'' ''We don't feel that someone in the parade who is topless or nearly naked is appropriate for a family audience,'' said parade chairman James Kidd. Continue reading "Jen To Strike Again!"

In turn, Libbey Bowl audiences are known for their patience, and often they are rewarded with the unforgettable. When Steve Reich's difficult Four Organs was premiered in New York in the early l970's, a near-riot erupted. When played for the first time on the west coast In Ojai in the same era, the piece piqued interest and resulted in a recording (according to a story recounted by Mark Swed in today's Los Angeles Times .) Last Saturday night at Libbey Bowl the festival broke away from its celebration of the hypnotic music of Reich for an exploration into the outer limits of voice and music today. The evening began with a baffling piece in which one woman alone sang wordlessly against an array of electronica without a beat. But what followed was something else. Mesmerizingly so. Described as a spoken opera by composer Michael Jarrell, Cassandre is actually a monologue with orchestral support, but most of all it's a stunning piece of writing, drawn from the ancient myth of Cassandra, as written by one of the greatest of German writers today, the novelist Christa Wolf . Barbara Sukowa, a compelling actress with a guttural voice, growled her way through an English translation of the monologue. This was the West Coast premiere of the piece. Here's how it begins: Cassandra is a ruined woman. Once she was a princess, but now she has been brought low by a god.Because she refused Apollo, he spit into her mouth, and forever after she was cursed to speak the truth to all, but be believed by no one. Sounds like the Al Gore story, said one fellow in my section.

This year's Memorial Day was quite different for me, but not so much because of the local events. i have made some significant personal strides relative to the above issues by listening to the testimony of warriors at the Winter Soldier 2008 event, responding to my brother's choice to join the Marine Corps Reserves, reading some of the local veterans' stories in their book "Ojai Valley's Veterans Stories", and connecting to local organizers of Iraq Veterans Against the War. *** At this time in 2006 i didn't have a nine-month-old daughter, so i was a little slower getting out the door this time. i missed the pancake breakfast at the American Legion building in Oak View, but caught the last half of the parade, where i noted several violations of the Federal Flag Code . After the parade a sizable crowd gathered at Longhorn's Feed & Supply to hear speakers and for the awarding of the parade trophies. i approached as Ms. Shelley Rhoades was reading the same poem she read last time in Libbey Park, while Boy Scout Troop 503 did the same enigmatic flag-passing ceremony. i began to wonder what was going to happen at the park. Some guy took the "stage" and led us all in prayer to a Christian God, thanking him for our community and lifestyle and for helping us preserve it, in Jesus' name. Veteran Al Wescott sang his original song "Soldiers, Sailors, and Tired Old Men", just like he did in 2006. The teen girls in their long satin dresses and label-sashes gave out awards to everything from a bagpiper to a llama (although i think it was an alpaca, technically) to "pooper scoopers". People clapped and cheered, then left.

Some lament in Ventura County that red tape and not-in-my-backyard-minded activists hinder progress.

"...Ojai residents concerned about mining truck traffic along Route 33 have scored something of a victory and will have a chance to ensure that victory holds May 14. That day, the Santa Barbara County Planning Commission will consider final action on the proposed Diamond Rock mine. After criticism of the mine's plans to use Highway 33 to transport material and other environmental concerns that might impact Ventura County more than Santa Barbara County, the plan was altered to prevent trucks from traveling south on 33, to reduce its production rates and truck trips to avoid situations where those truck trips might be necessary, and to address other environmental concerns.

In contrast to the mugham traditions of Central Asian countries, Azeri mugham is more free-form and less rigid; it is often compared to the improvised field of jazz.

The Coalition stressed the need for monitoring and enforcement of permit conditions, particularly of gravel mine operations, a fact that was reflected back by four of the Supervisors to County staff at the end of the meeting. The Planning Division currently is responsible for oversight of the Conditional Use Permit (CUP) issued to the Ozena Mine and Gravel operation. According to an article in the Ventura County Star by Tony Biasotti on Wednesday, April 9, 2008, Berg's noted that there are there are many ways in which the county could be more "transparent, predictable and accountable."

It was Spring, yet I had lost that in my step. In my driveway lay a blue dragonfly, motionless and rigid like the brown earthbound autumn leaves. I picked up the winged one and placed it in my palm. So light, it's weight imperceptible in my hand. It seemed strange to have one born of flight, of air and river life, leave it's remains on an asphalt grave. A metaphor, my life in my hands. Breathing three times, gentle, warm, across the cross that lay so still. Then, a tremble, a tickle, a straight vertical ascension, above the treetops and out of sight. This is where the miraculous meets the mundane, and the future moves beyond our imagination. Congrats, Raymond. Please stay on the line and our producer will get your info and send you a package.

The film, by Academy Award and Pulitzer Prize-winner William Inge, starred Marilyn Monroe and Don Murray.

In your September 27, 2007 letter to Howard Smith (prepared by Pat Richards) and your January 8, 2008 letter to John Broesamle, the department denies both complaints of early morning and late afternoon CUP truck violations by citing the weigh tickets provided to the Planning Department by Ozena. After an extensive forensic study of the weigh tickets turned over to the Planning Division by the agent for Ozena, John Hecht of West Coast Environmental & Engineering, âStop the Trucks,â now firmly believes that the use of self-prepared weigh tickets, which appear to be the sole tool used by the division to monitor truck traffic, is not valid. It is a method in which the results can seemingly be manipulated at will by the mine operator; and/or the weigh master; the trucking contractor; and/or their designated drivers; and may result in fraud or misrepresentation of the facts. Clearly they fail the test as the evidentiary basis for any claims, pro or con. Details of our review are in the âAnalysisâ provided both below and attached separately.

This powerful stretch, with the arms reaching up toward the heavens represents a "leap in consciousness," a change from one stage of life to the next. The inspiring teacher demonstrating the pose is in her 70's. Hanumanasana is a fun pose to practice at the end of your yoga session, when your body is nice and warmed up from practicing Standing Poses, Downward Facing Dog Pose, Lunges and other Yoga Basics.

He is doing all of this because he wants to shift perceptions. The story of Ballard's nonprofit, Hearts of Fire , is in this weekâs VC Reporter . Excerpt: Hearts of Fire has become a burning passion for Ballard, who admits, âIâm not trying to solve any problems, not find them housing and food. Iâm just looking for a way for them to express themselves.â His next project is to bring the art tour local and travel up and down the coast to the five counties suffering the brunt of homelessness. This year, he will focus on 25 shelters from Santa Barbara southward, with art workshops followed by local exhibits that can be attended by the artists themselves. âWeâre just really excited about whatâs going to happen next,â he said. This is only on newsstands until tomorrow, but you can always check it out online (but the newsstand version is better because you will get a better look at the featured artwork).

Lauded personally as a "down-to-earth, generous, kindhearted, life-loving, unselfish individual", his death prompted remarks from such Hollywood heavyweights as Mel Gibson and Ang Lee, both of whom mourned the "tragic loss" of a young life. On the same day as Ledger's death, 20-year-old Army Sergeant Michael R. Sturdivant of Conway, Arkansas died in Kirkuk, Iraq " of injuries sustained in a vehicle accident during convoy operations ". Those who knew him praise his service-oriented attitude, dedication, and volunteerism. His life was marked by a good heart and kind words. Needless to say, Sturdivant's untimely and tragic death received only local attention . And why is this? Is an actor's life worth more than a soldier's? Is a tuxedo more prized than camouflage? Many will unhesitatingly (although with some disgust) answer "Yes!", and it would seem that the evidence is on your side. i answer "Yes" also, but not because i believe that one life or vocation is worth more than another. i believe that Mr. Ledger's tragedy is so because it was UNEXPECTED. The difference for Mr. Sturdivant is that death is one of the accepted risks of his job. Rarely mentioned or stated explicitly, to be killed is one of the things a soldier - and those who send him or her into battle - can EXPECT. Soldiers are made to die, and war was made to kill them.

I am a self-taught writer. Almost forty years have flown by, but I still recall the day I triumphantly placed my first newspaper column, thick with white-out, on the desk of Fred Volz, the grand editor of the Ojai Valley News. Through sheer desperation and force of will, in the midst of taking care of my two-year old son Bo, I managed to turn my messy pages into a sparkling published masterpiece --or so it looked to me! A few weeks ago I found a book sitting on a chair near my front porch. When I saw the title, "Writing Begins with the Breath," for me, a yogi-writer, it was love at first sight! I thought to myself, "Wow! Just what I need!" Destiny dropped this book in my lap just in the nick of time, as I am about to embark on a very personal writing adventure.

Admission is free. Two of my favorite talents are in the production. My son Eli as Barney a friendly fellow with a flask who appears for a few moments at the beginning of the single-act, one hour tragedy. Local blues singer April Hendrix, my other favorite local talent, sways and sings in back-lit silhouette as the ghost of Bessie Smith. John Diehl brilliantly plays the irascible father of Alexis Poole, a young nurse whose starched white uniform contrasts beautifully with her pitch black soul. Great dialog and a minimal, fabric-screen and wood frame set allow for a fun use of back-lighting and shadow play. Under the spirited direction of Scott Campbell, even the newest actors to the stage shine with star quality. Ivan Matip and Nachelle Sodetani both give outstanding stage-debut performances. The school's office release from their website follows....

Hope was diagnosed in April with an aggressive form of colon cancer. Even though I live only a few blocks from her house and walk past it regularly, I was not aware that she was struggling for her life. I have many memories of Hope, who I met at a community gathering held at her house some years ago. I remember how she led me into her very funky art/writing studio where she explained, among other things, that she didn't waste a single piece of paper. Every scrap had some creative recycled use. I remember purchasing a wall hanging made of rice paper with a photograph of Grandmother Oak, taken at sunset the day before the tree was taken down. Underneath the image of Grandmother Oak was a poem called "Grandmother Oaks Last Pink Moment." ( After I first wrote this I learned that Hope's Grandmother Oak's Last Pink Moment monoprint, from a photograph made in Libbey Park, was the signature image of the Ojai Poetry Festival ) http://www.ojaipoetryfestival.org/regional_2007.html#frazier This morning I felt inspired to visit Hope Frazier's website, a place that reflects Hope's magic and her love of the natural environment and all living things. I discovered so many things about her, that I know will inspire my own Life and creativity in the coming New Year. I hope you too will visit her site, if you have not done so already. www.HopeFrazier.com This morning friends of Hope received the following e-mail message from her husband, Doug Adrianson, in which he shared some links to her obituaries. He wrote: "Below are links to what is appearing today in the Miami Herald and Pasadena Star-News. I'm sure the OVN will run something, but not until tomorrow. Please share these with the circle -- they may learn a few things about the old gal that they didn't know!" http://www.miamiherald.com/511/story/363108.html http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_7850468 http://www.insidesocal.com/publiceye/2007/12/hope_frazier_rip.html Posted by Suza Francina at 01:09 PM | Permalink  | Comments (7) | author bio December 23, 2007 The Holidays Are Here (And We're STILL At War) Not a new one, but still a good one.

So this year, with the bill of Perla Batalla and Brett Dennen to lure us, we had our brown paper tickets nice and early. Vegas can wait (and it helps to have a newborn). We arrived just in time to hear MC Claud Mann welcoming everyone, and Battle-of-the-Bands fourth place winners The Imaginative Clams took the stage as we found a good spot to sit in the elite (as designated by the colored bracelets and plastic chains) "Front Lawn" section. i gazed sadly backward at the row of faces that made up the front of the "Back Lawn" section with the Five Man Electrical Band's "Signs" playing in my head over whatever Avant Garage or The Philosophy were sharing from the stage.

"Ojai's Libbey Bowl is going substantially greener for Food For Thought's benefit concert featuring Perla Batalla and Brett Dennen," announced event coordinator, Marty Fujita. The event, Locally Grown 2, which features not only Batalla and Dennen, but the winners of the August 4th Ojai -Ventura youth Battle of the Bands competition, will benefit Food for Thought's farm-to-school program which educates children about healthy food choices and the importance of good environmental stewardship. Food For Thought's programs are in six of the seven schools of the Ojai Unified School District. The program also works with OUSD Food Service to introduce as much fresh, locally grown, seasonal produce into school meals as possible. "We want this event not only to raise money for our program, but to be a model for how we can do large events, and keep our carbon footprint as small as possible. We may not be 100% green for this event, but we will be reaching for that standard," added Fujita. Continue reading "Food For Thought Ojai's Locally Grown Concert Goes Green!"

Myridian recently performed for the troops at Camp Pendleton. They've always stayed true to their original music, but plan to surprise fans with some familiar sounds next week, "Weâve worked up a few covers for the Rolling Stones, Beatles, and Steely Dan fans, and Lady Sheila, our groovinâ bass goddess will be with us!" Since summer is just about over, and I would like it to linger on, I thought we should take a listen to the first track on their CD, Prime Myridian, aptly named, "Summer of My Mind."

The weekend of September 21-23 is a major opportunity to celebrate Peace in a public and audio/visual way that directly builds a culture of peace...it is a time to be the change we wish to see. Please consider how you can help locally. We have some major opportunities for building a local culture of Peace coming up, and the main purpose of this post is to solicit volunteers for a variety of roles within that effort. September 21st is International Peace Day , and the Peace Alliance â the folks behind the campaign for a federal Department of Peace â will be coming to Ojai on that weekend to perform their play âThe Gift of Peaceâ at our own Libbey Bowl. There will also be an Interfaith peace-focused schedule of ceremony, prayer, and music on Sunday the 23rd. The collective Retreats of Ojai are on board with this in a big way and are organizing events during the entire Peace Weekend, and the Ojai Peace Coalition is going to be a part of it!

El Roblar in Meiners Oaks 8 pm - Tickets $15 at the door Cynthia Waring Matthews first escaped the sorrow of her early days by retreating to a convent as a young woman. Emerging after a time to re-enter the world at large, she was looking for an occupation and found herself absorbed into the world of bodywork, where she became a licensed massage therapist and massaged over 20,000 people in 30 years, from the anonymous to the dazzlingly famous, from infants to the elderly, from those seeking healing to those seeking a bodily indulgence. In her practice, she made a unique discovery: That through her fingers, she was able to read bodies and into the histories of the people beneath her hands. She could unlock the experiences and traumas stored in their bodies through cellular memories.

When i arrived at a few minutes before 4pm, there were but a handful of people gathered, most of whom were busily setting up easels of pictures and arranging chairs and sound equipment. within minutes, the gathering swelled to a strong crowd that read like a who's-who of the Ojai Valley...i saw Sid and Sheila Cohn, the Al-Awars, Jim Calire, John Azevedo, Noel Douglas, Peggy La Cerra, and dozens of other very familiar faces that i personally dont even have names for. we opened with music and prayer, and elegant and heartfelt stories and reflections were shared by friends and family. as seems to be so often the case with those who leave us, these served to describe a person whom it feels beautiful to remember, but - as my wife observed as we solemnly left - whom we wish we'd known better while he was here. it's clear that Glenn loved us all, and that we all loved him no matter how large or small our piece of his experience. i believe that Cheri Mason-Emanuel's son said it best when he introspected that Glenn never seemed sad...always happy. and so it hardly feels appropriate to be sad that he's gone; we can only be happy that he was here.

Dishing Ojai: Oak Tree CafÃ© and Bakery: I have finally found the perfect sandwich in Ojai at the Oak Tree CafÃ© and Bakery at the corner of Fox and Ojai Avenue. I had the broiled open-faced tomato and mozzarella sandwich with olive tapenade spread and Bill had the albacore tuna salad sandwich with pesto spread (he threatened to order it "Mikeâs Way," but I stopped him). Both were accompanied by a terrific salad tossed with shredded carrots, parmesan, tomatoes, their homemade croutons (which they sell by the bag) and choice of honey lemon or balsamic vinaigrette. We sat outside under a shady pepper tree sipping sun-brewed iced tea and devoured every bite. Oak Tree started as a small bakery and coffee stop down on Hwy. 33 in a converted ATM drive-thru selling the most amazing pastries. They still have the pastries, but youâve got to get there early to enjoy them. More Dishing Ojai starts here. Read-on to find out about local comedy and a solo theatrical performance...

Music was already floating out of the propped-open auditorium doors, where The Household Gods had already begun their benefit set with a beautifully-lyric'd song that i missed the title of. There were maybe 50 people in the theater - sitting in small groups or alone - of all ages, and all seemed to be enjoying the music by nodding, clapping, or singing along with the Gods' master-full set, punctuated by instrument-switching and playful banter between songs. If you've never heard the Gods (this was my second time), you're missing an exceptional piece of cultural Ojai and uniquely arranged covers of songs you know and love, as well as exposure to new favorites you didn't know you had.

Champagne Sundayâs lead singer, Jessi Reems-Terrell, reeled us in with her unbelievable vocals while the other two members of the band kept us there for an entire set with solid harmonies and brilliant hooks.

The Real Dirt on Farmer John is a movie about Illinois farmer John Petersen and his decades-long struggle to wrest right livelihood from his familyâs farm. Winner of over 30 festival awards, this film has it all â life, death, sex, terrorism, art, failure, success. Helped along by the fact that his mom started taking 16 mm movies of the family when John was a child, and by the fact that John is an artist as well as a bred-in-the-bones farmer, this movie reaches far beyond any normal expectations of a documentary about a mid-western farmer. Presented by Food for Thought Ojai, the Ojai Film Society, and Slow Food Ojai/Ventura. The Real Dirt on Farmer John will show Saturday and Sunday, June 30-July 1, at 4:30 pm at the Ojai Playhouse in downtown Ojai. Tickets are $8 for adults, and $5 for seniors and students at the door.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). When I first heard Sgt.Pepper's by the Beatles it was one of those albums that jump started my inspiration and interest in music. The orchestral arrangements, sound scapes and phenomenal melodies (not to mention the cool outfits of the Fab four) kept me transfixed. I must have listened to it at least 2-3 times a day for months. Few things in life have this kind of impact on us. This was one for me. What event or... captivated and inspired you as a child? Here's great article about the making of : http://www.riprense.com/sgtpepper.htm It begins: Many critics, I think, have forgotten that âPepperâ was a kind of pinnacle of genre, a new sort of music that had never exactly existed before. You no more dismiss its importance and achievement than you dismiss Beethovenâs Ninth Symphony because itâs 19th century orchestral music. Continuing that analogy, you donât evaluate the Ninth Symphony as a collection of movements that have no particular relationship to one another, and you do not evaluate âSgt. Pepperâ as a bunch of songs that happened to appear together on a vinyl disc. This album is a piece. Though not conceived as a whole, it was executed as one---the product of a single gigantic and intense series of recording sessions. It also bears remembering that there were no hits from âPepper,â no singles. The whole damn thing was a hit, and the biggest of its time, if not all time. In the summer of 1967, in many cities, you could not walk the length of a block without leaving earshot of this record. Humanityâs collective jaw was agape, its ears full of iridescent, irresistable sounds of a kind it had never heard before.

"Paper Tiger, Toothless Dragon" Contrary to recent press stories, there is NO deal in place between Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties regarding the ban of gravel truck traffic on Route 33 from the proposed Diamond Rock Mine in the Cuyama Valley and Ojai. This alleged deal is nothing more than an attempt to undercut our opposition. What they seek to do is an example of the classic political maneuvers of the âThree Dâs:â âDelay,â âDistractâ and/or âDeny.â Do not be misled! They seek to pull attention away from their latest (and substandard) EIR of May 2007 which we will not even dignify by calling it a âFinal EIR.â There are logical holes in this EIR that a blind man could drive a fleet of gravel trucks through at night. But more dangerously, the CUP that they dangle in front of us contains no verification of truck traffic. It is a âPaper Tiger, a Toothless Dragon.â President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, âDo not pass any laws you can not enforce because it only breeds disrespect for the law.â Allowing self-monitoring of truck loads and drivers has already proven to be a disaster in Ventura County where a total failure of our own Planning Department to create CUPâs in 2001 and 2003 that have any verification or enforcement has left us with the 24/7 nightmare we now experience. Do not be misled. There is no deal. The only way we will win this war is with your total support and dedication. Attend the hearing in Santa Maria!!!

I have been able to avoid caring about Sports for a long time now, but it's NBA Playoff Season , and the games are Live in my living room. And when something comes this close, you have almost no choice but to allow a relationship to develop. The trick is to start to learn the details. Understanding the strengths of the individual players' games, knowing the strategies and preferences of the different coaches, and getting the scoop on the team's management turns Basketball into a dramatic and entertaining piece of theatre. Yet I am noticing that it is much easier to be interested and engaged when you have a favorite player, coach or team. Otherwise there is no emotional juice to draw you towards it. Trying to stay an intellectual observer is too boring and does not imprint the experience in the mind. But as soon as you allow yourself preferences, the experience becomes personal and relevant and you literally See the Game differently.

I got a little jolt last night as I sat in Upavistha Konasana (Seated Wide Angle Pose) watching the PBS documentary on Hippies and the Summer of Love. It dawned on me that it was 40 years ago (1967) that I took the Greyhound bus from Ventura to San Francisco and rented a room on the third story of a house on the Haight. For the first time in my life I was free to draw around the clock with Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkle in the background. I could sit for hours on the window ledge, in my painted jeans, watching the unfolding hippy invasion below. From my third story perch I could spot Janis Joplin in the crowd and hear Country Joe and the Fish playing nearby. Imagine growing up in Ojai and suddenly finding yourself transported amongst 20,000 people dancing in Golden Gate Park! The documentary showed the Human Be-In, a Gathering of the Tribes, and all the great counterculture gurus. I remembered how I made money selling my art, babysitting the four poor children who lived in the basement below, and peddling the Berkeley Barb. You could buy a ten pound bag of brown-rice for $1 and get clothes at the Free Store. I don't remember ever eating the Free Food. When I ran out of rice I fasted to protest the Vietnam War. My AWOL boyfriend was picked up by the military police in the dead of night and locked up in the Presidio. Did anyone else see the PBS special last night? Did you see yourself? As I stretched forward in Upavisthakonasana I had this great cosmic insight that we're all still trying to turn on, tune in and drop out... Is that what growing older is all about?

There is a nice article in Canadian publication The Star Phoenix on the Ojai Valley Inn & Spa . Money quote: With a 360-degree view of the dramatic mountain range, the 89-hectare Spanish colonial- style resort is nestled snugly within the valley. The air is noticeably fresh -- if not sweet -- compared to L.A. several hundred metres below. With complimentary valet service, we leave our car behind and forget it exists until check-out two days later. The attention to detail is beyond expectation -- especially after having just disembarked an Air Canada flight where the menu selection is no longer chicken or beef, but water or orange juice, with the option to buy an overpriced, nearly naked, six-inch Subway sub. Get it? Ojai is a place that people come to from around the world to get away from Subway. By preventing the urgent moratorium and allowing the Subway franchisee to file for the necessary permits, Joe DeVito has single-handedly torpedoed the very perception of what Ojai is.

Although most people are terrified of change, there is no greater recipe for failure than inertia, doing things as they have always been done. Ellison S. Onizuka, one of our astronauts whose death in the 1987 crash of the space shuttle Challenger illustrated the danger of risk taking, said it best in a speech he gave to students few years earlier. âThe people who make this world run, whose lives can be termed successful, whose names will go down in history books, are not the cynics, the critics, or the armchair quarterbacks. They are the adventurers, the explorers, and the doers of this world. When they see a wrong or a problem, they do something about it... Rather than leaning back and criticizing how things are, they work to make things the way they should be. They are the aggressive, the self-starters, the innovative, and the imaginative of this worldâ¦. â Continue reading "Innovation 101 and the Conquest of Fire"  Posted by Howard Smith at 05:55 PM | Permalink  | Comments (0) | author bio March 25, 2007 Ojai Music I recently had the pleasure of meeting Fred Schmitt, a prolific singer/songwriter and a musical genius, who lives right here in our little valley.

He has written over 200 songs and finds it hard to keep the muse at bay. And he doesn't have a recording contract. Incredible. I chatted him up over coffee this afternoon at Stir Crazy with my friend Matt and turned the mics on to capture a couple of his songs, too. The interview and the music are on Radio Ojai.

Ojai is a special place, not just for its geography, flora and fauna, small-town architecture and rich native American history - its also because of the people - talented, creative souls who tend to walk to the beat of their own drummer and carve their own path through life. Check in for daily musings, rants, Ojai news and greater goings-on from the place some call Shangri-La. We've certainly had our share of musings, rants, news and greater goings-on - 425 posts and counting. And we're just getting started. My deep gratitude to twenty-two authors who have dipped in a toe or taken the plunge, and to our ever-increasing audience (over 1,500 visitors and 5,000 page views yesterday).

But it was a little more exciting than that. I had a face-to-face interview with Al Gore on the red carpet at his screening of An Inconvenient Truth at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.

(Poetry) This year's annual Erotic Poetry & Spoken Word reading at the Artist's Union Gallery in Ventura will be held on Saturday, Feb. 10th at 7:00 pm. This reading celebrates the erotic in the broadest sense - works that evoke yearning, longing, and loss, as well as the more traditional praises of desire and tributes to the beloved - and commemorates the opening of the Artistsâ Union Gallery's annual erotic art exhibition. âEroticism,â says event-host Friday, âis most easily found in food, poetry, art and sex; three of the four items mentioned will be provided for you at the benefit.â The line-up includes Richard Beban , author of What the Heart Weighs , Bay Area author Adrienne Marcus, poet/publisher Glenna Luschei , and many others. âWe are so lucky to have such an incredible assemblage of talent under the same roof. We expect to hear poems from ardent to zany, and everything in-between. All that energy should make for an intense reading,â says co-organizer Phil Taggart. âAccording to Hesiod, Eros instills all notions of beauty and anguish within our souls,â says co-organizer and award-winning poet, Marsha de la O. âBoth beauty and anguish are principal considerations of poetry. We wanted to give a distinguished group of Southern Californian poets the opportunity to explore the nuances of eroticism in an environment where visual artists and sculptors have used other media to explore the same concept.â Admission is $10 at the door. The event is a benefit with all proceeds going to the Artistsâ Union Gallery. The Artistsâ Union Gallery is located at 330 South California Street in Ventura. Poets reading include: Joyce LaMers, Jackson Wheeler, Tim Tipton, Roe Estep, Shelley Savren, Elijah Imlay, Ryan Gillenwater, Richard Beban, Howard Billou, Carol Davis, Carlye Archibeque, Ellen Reich, Florence Weinberger, Adrianne Marcus, Doris Vernon, Glenna Luschei, Perie Longo, Virginia Mariposa, Robert Peake, Teka Lark-Lo, Laura Diamond, Mary Kay Rummel, Lee Rossi, Tim Pompey, Cathryn Andreson, Larry Colker, Patricia Lynn Belkovitz, Bob Sterling, Marsha de la O, Friday and Phil Taggart.

I have vague memories of these times but I can honestly say the first President I really remember is Jimmy Carter . Carter has been a hero of mine for many years because of his honesty, integrity, and his work for peace. In particular, the Carter Center , founded by Carter, has the goal for advancing human rights and alleviating suffering.

As a result, and at Tyler's prompting, I thought it might be fun to invite readers of The Ojai Post to submit Haiku. To submit a poem or read others already submitted, simply click the comment link right underneath this article. If you already know what Haiku is all about, you can skip down there now to read and write some Haiku. For those of you unfamiliar with the form, English Haiku is loosely based on the Japanese form from which it gets the name. In English Haiku, the only constraint is that each line have a certain number of syllables. It is actually quite easy: the first line must have five syllables, the second line seven, and the third line five again. That's it. Three lines, twelve syllables total. Traditional Japanese Haiku usually sprung from deep observation of nature. Often the first two lines are meditative and descriptive, and the third and final line of a Haiku presents some element of surprise or revelation, or perhaps a new angle on the subject. This is not always the case, but works well to delight the reader and hopefully leave them with a lasting impression. Here is probably the most famous of all Haiku by a seventeenth century poet named BashÅ : The old pond frog jumps in - water's sound. (Note: because this was translated from Japanese, the English version does not conform to the 5, 7, and 5 syllables rule. But it gives you a flavor of traditional Haiku.) If you are interested, you can read more about the Haiku form here .

Yet Zak Smith, with uninhibited bravado and exactly the right kind of insanity, has done something remarkable in "Gravity's Rainbow Illustrated": created a series of images that approach the richness of their source. He draws a lurid and intoxicating netherworld, complete in its own right and, at the same time, an illuminating companion to the novel. Since all editions of "Gravity's Rainbow" seem to be printed from the same plates, each one of Smith's illustrations will correspond to one page of the foxed copy you've been trucking around since college.

Remember, everyone who preorders a calendar will be entered into a drawing. The winner will choose a copy of the 16x23 photo of their choice. Those of you have seen them know that these photographs are stunning. So please go to www.majiquephoto.com to buy your 'Men of Ojai 2007 Calendar, The Fine Art Photography of Attasalina Dews.'

A brief introduction: you probably haven't seen me around too much, though I've lived here for a couple of years. I tend to keep to myself. That said, I love community and this one in particular. And I love poetry. So please join me as I seek to uncover goings on in this area related to literature, writing, and the arts. So far the process has been a lot like flipping over stones after a rain and finding all sorts of interesting things wriggling underneath them. Here's one big stone: probably the best resource for poetry events in this area, and one I recommend you bookmark right now is Poetix.Net . Phil Taggart does an excellent job of maintaining a fairly comprehensive listing of poetry goings on for Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. In the realm of poetry superstars, Lawrence Ferlenghetti (who was featured at last year's Ojai Poetry Festival ) will be reading in Santa Barbara this coming Thursday. And Pulitzer Prize winning poet Mary Oliver is coming to our area in January. Lots more poetic goodness on the horizon. Join me as I uncover more offerings, one stone at a time.

I wrote an article about it, which is also now on newsstands in the Ojai Visitors Guide : Photo from "The Cave of the Yellow Dog," courtesy of the Ojai Film Festival. I will always say the best time to visit Ojai is during the autumnal equinox. Whenever anyone quips that Californians donât have seasons, I simply retort, âSounds like you havenât been to Ojai in October.â The liquid amber treesâ verdant leaves seem to turn to earth, rust and gold right before your eyes while an early morning light casts an umber glow across the valley that signals fallâs arrival. Shadows lengthen and crisp sunny days yield bright blue skies that frame the Topa Topas in such a way that youâre sure you can reach out and grab Chief Peakâs nose. And clear starry nights beckon you to a bench under a blanket in Libbey Bowl beneath 200-year-old oak trees to gaze up into a movie screen on the opening night of the Ojai Film Festival.

Itâs Sunday, and as is typical on a Sunday in July, Iâm soaking in the cool green muck that clings to the corners and curves of my pool. Hundred degree days invite the emerald monster to creep in despite due diligence with chemicals and brushing. I wade in, brush in hand, ready to tackle the task at hand. I scour, scrub and scrape, coaxing the grime away until my shoulders begin to strain. Now and then the handle slips and I grate my knuckles on the side of the pool. The scab from last week was just healing when I manage to grind it off again. I wince just as a breeze kicks up, blowing more oak leaves in. I had just scooped a net-full off. I grab the net again, scooping more leaves and a drowning yellow jacket, too, who had no doubt just buzzed in for a drink. A spider hangs off the coping and refuses to get into the net. I grab the brush again and whisk it away. A water bug swims around my waist. Heâs swift and cunning, but I finally catch him and hoist him onto the deck. Sydney, my yellow lab, sniffs at the hopping pest then quickly moves on to other smells in the yard. I feel something crawling on my back.

I ran over to Bartâs Books Saturday afternoon to see if I could find a Ray Bradbury book. I figured if I was going to a book signing, I ought to have a book for him to sign. Iâm ashamed to say that I skimmed Fahrenheit 451 in high school and spent more time with the Cliffâs Notes than the book itself, though it was practically beat into me how important this book was. So, happy to have any excuse to venture into Bartâs Books, I willingly got lost between the stacks, meeting the torn and dusty likes of Joyce, Bronte, James and low and behold, nestled amongst the Sci-Fi section, Bradbury. There was only one copy of F. 451 and I snatched it up like it was the last pixie tangerine of the season at the Farmers Market. I read the inside cover: âFahrenheit 451 â the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and burnsâ¦â An early eighties reprint, itâs in relatively good shape, with yellowing pages and notes in the margins that tell me this book was loved. And at $7.50, a bargain find. I sat side-by-side with aspiring authors at the Santa Barbara Writers Conference , waiting for Ray Bradbury to take the stage. I eye the crowd, which was absolutely what you would expect of wannabe writers. Not particularly well-dressed or even necessarily well-groomed, but certainly well-prepared and exceedingly punctual: a graying, balding, fifty-something bespectacled man with not three hairs on his head proudly collected into a pony tail; a tall, brooding, dark, big-haired woman with a fuzzy leopard print hat. Nearly everyone had a writing implement, be it pen and paper or an IMac. Geeks galore. And I was one of them. At least I tried to be. Oh, hell, I desperately yearned to be!

Thatâs right, Iâm an 80âs girl and I still have the Footloose soundtrack cassette tape to prove it. Sure, there was U2, Midnight Oil and Billy Idol â they rocked.

Until just a few days ago, I was on dial-up. Not as horrifying an admission as the fact that I only wash my gym clothes once a week, but startling nonetheless. It seems that in my little corner of the Ojai Valley, high-speed internet is pretty hard to come by. Iâm on Earthlink now, and the experience thus far has been trying. Sitting at my computer in robe and slippers on Sunday morning, on hold for an eternity with someone Iâm sure is on the other side of the planet trying to tell me just what buttons to push on my magic little box while watching Tim Russert put the hurt on Al Franken is not my idea of fun. Iâm not blown away by the speed, either, as I had expected I would be (imagining wind blowing through my hair with each click of the mouse).

And after a rich, buttery cookie, I duck back outside and continue on my way, rolling down the back pathway and over the Art Center bridge. I sidle through Libbey Park thinking about how lucky I am to be a human in this fine spot on the planet. That's a rainy Monday Ojai memory.
