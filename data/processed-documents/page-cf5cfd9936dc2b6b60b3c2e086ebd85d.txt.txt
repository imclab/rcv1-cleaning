This book has a wonderful cadence and rythmn that can be tapped on the board book when read to the child. This is a great way to keep the childs attention while reading the book. It is also exciting when you see the child pick up the book and start tapping and reading (as best they can) the book. It also teachers children primary colors and is easily memorized for retelling.

Great price? I loved reading his book! ... see more I loved reading his book! I'm not the kind of person who keeps their book copies so they can read them over again, so I was hoping to get this book at the library. Since the library didn't have it, I got a copy from Target. The paperback copy of this book is nice if you don't mind small scratches on the title page. I loved the bok, but I didn't want to pay nine dollars for it when I could borrow it for free from a library. see less gracereviews478 Jul 17,12 add to compare Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire compare Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  DK Readers: Star Wars: The Legendary Yoda (Paperback) quick info.
