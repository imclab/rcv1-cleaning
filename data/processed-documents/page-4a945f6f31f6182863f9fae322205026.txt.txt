REUTERS/Gary (GARY CAMERON/REUTERS ) For Fairfax resident Aaron Carey, attending auto shows is an annual pilgrimage. A self-proclaimed âcar-nut,â heâs been going to auto shows for decades â in Philadelphia for almost 30 years, in Frankfurt once during his service in the U.S. Army in the 1990âs, and, after having recently moved to the area, in Washington. Over the years, Careyâs reason for going changed. When he was in high school, he used to ogle at the hot new cars he couldnât afford. As an adult, he took his two young sons, now grown, to impart his love for cars to them. These days, Carey attends the show alone, as much for his fascination with the technology as for research on which car to buy next. âIt used to be more the excitement and seeing new models. Now, Iâm looking at the price,â Carey said. Carey may represent the changing face of todayâs auto show goers. In the past four or five years, the demographics of auto show attendees has changed from overwhelmingly male between ages 30 and 52 to include a more diverse range of ages, races, and incomes. Instead of just âmotorheads,â Washington Auto Show producer John OâDonnell said the shows increasingly attract consumers with intent to buy. Decades ago, going to auto shows used to represent a father-son or grandfather-father-son tradition, OâDonnell said. âAmericans have had a strong love affair with the freedom and mobility a car gives, but people are beginning to view vehicles as nothing more than a means for getting from point A to point B,â OâDonnell said. This shift is reflected in auto shows themselves. To appeal to the auto showâs growing female audience â as women often make purchasing decisions for a household, OâDonnell said, theyâre increasingly deciding which cars to buy â organizers scheduled celebrity appearances from various a capella groups, Olympic gymnast Gabrielle Douglas and a handful of other female-oriented acts. In past years, the entertainment has been more geared toward men, he added. Next year, OâDonnell thinks the show may cater more to young adults. Last weekend, he noticed a pattern heâd never seen â large crowds of young people buying tickets around 9 p.m. on weekends, catching the tail end of the auto show, and then heading to bars afterwards. For the 2014 auto show, OâDonnell is proposing an âAuto Show After Hoursâ event next year â complete with beer and wine â to retain this audience. But some still come to the auto show just for their love of cars. Laurel resident Vernon Bacud brought his 3-year-old son and father-in-law to the auto show to cultivate a tradition he didnât have growing up in the Philippines. Though he originally started going because heâs a car enthusiast, his favorite part is âspending time with family and friends.â Hagerstown, Md.-resident Dick Martin brought his childhood friend, John Hopkins to the auto show, the first theyâd ever attended. When they were growing up â âwhen gas was 22 cents a gallon,â Martin noted â they used to go to their local car dealerships for brochures, which had pictures of all the newest models. âYouâd have a stack of papers with Chevy, Ford, Plymouth, Dodge, Pontiac,â Martin said. âThere wasnât any such thing as a Volkswagen,â Hopkins said. Though Martin is a car enthusiast, he said until now â since heâs retired â he didnât have time to look at cars. âI was too busy. Now Iâve got plenty of free time, and I can go and play.â Personal Post Email Tumblr Reddit Stumbleupon Digg Delicious FEATURED ARTICLES The kitchen of 2013: Experts dish A Butler Well Served by This Election Five myths about electric cars More: Skip the boardwalk, tunnels: 5 Virginia beaches youâve never heard of Saying goodbye to my child, the youngster Vertigo can be frightening, but it often can be treated without drugs The best and worst small businesses to start in 2013 The Secret to Cleaning Grout in Tile Floors âLee Danielsâ The Butlerâ movie review Loading...
