I had no mechanical problems when I had the car and that is what told him when he test drove it. He says he is going to sue me for fraud...I say "buyer beware"-shouldn't he have had a mechanic check it out? Answer As an individual, you are responsible to answer a prospective buyer's questions honestly, and you cannot deliberately hide or disguise a known problem (putting duct tape around a leaky fuel or brake line, for example). Other than that, it is "buyer beware" when purchasing a used car from an individual. He'd have a difficult time suing you because of this standard, and the fact that the problem was electrical makes his case even more dubious. Electrical items like starters and fuel pumps tend to work one moment and not the next; they don't always give warning that they're about to give out. And yes, he should have had a mechanic check the car over. If he had requested to take the car to one and you refused, then it should have been a warning to him to look elsewhere. If he never even asked, then it's his fault, not yours.
