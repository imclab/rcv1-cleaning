Though I have worked and studied most of my life in the technical field of computers with only minimal prior sales experience being with a cleaning and restoration business I owned for a couple of years, I did managed to become Sales person of the year at a top dealership. Attaining manufactures sales certification, sales guild membership, and state certifications as well as NADA certification along the way.  I have also drawn on my past extensive knuckle busting hands on auto modification and restoration experiences. The expensive hobby that I got into for twenty years was most educational in the areas of auto mechanics, auto body and interior trim. I have rebuild engines, torn apart transmissions, replaced differentials, floor pans, doors, fenders, glass, suspensions, brakes etc. etc. I discovered the magic and appeal of a car at eight when my eyes bulged out of my head on a sunny summer afternoon as I first glared at a brand new 1963-split window Corvette. Then again at twelve when the 67 Chevy Camaro made its dbut. A few years later, I got into gear when at sixteen I bought my first car, a used 1967 Camaro. Soon my performance gear head or grease monkey friends and I were turning wrenches to lower my quarter mile time. Then in a few years, I graduating into SCCA concepts of safety, handling and braking. As time went on, I bought old performance cars and rebuilt them to drive and sell for a profit. By the time, I was twenty-one I had already owned five nice cars including my first Corvette all paid for by my own work. My Dad helped by patiently sharing his knowledge and teaching me his standards. He was a tough person to impress but if he said, it was good you could bet your life on it. By profession, Dad knew the standards of quality in materials, manufacturing, as well as people. Often as we worked on cars together, we compared build qualities and materials of the cars, as he share the story of his favorite car " a 1928 burgundy Mercedes". Additionally, non-automotive attributes that influenced my writing this book have come from my experience as a Camper, Businessman, Manager, Loving Husband and Parent.
