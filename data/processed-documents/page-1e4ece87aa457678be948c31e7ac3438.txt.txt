A A  2012 Chicago Auto Show: 2013 Hyundai Elantra Coupe Consumer Reports News: February 08, 2012 02:38 PM  Find Ratings Sports cars  Hyundai introduced its Elantra coupe today at the Chicago Auto Show, bringing a sporty-looking, two-door design to the line. The coupe will be powered by the same 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine as the Elantra sedan with an estimated 148 horsepower. The engine can be paired with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. Fuel economy is estimated at 29 mpg city, 40 mpg highway for the manual transmission model and 28/39 with the automatic. The Elantra will have a size advantage over its chief rival, the Honda Civic coupe, boasting a longer wheelbase and overall length, greater width, and a claimed more interior space. Standard features include “vehicle stability management,” similar to the system found on the Hyundai Equus that manages both the electronic stability control and electric power steering. The Elantra coupe will be offered in GS or SE trim lines. Touch-screen navigation is available on the SE with voice activation and a large 7.0-inch screen. The sound system can accesses digital music files via Bluetooth or connect through the iPod/USB inputs. The system also has an optional rear-view camera and users can upload personal pictures from a USB to be displayed on the screen. Optional features include a proximity key with push-button start, leather seating, heated front seats, power sunroof, and dual automatic temperature control. The Elantra coupe will hit dealerships this spring. — Liza Barth      Find Ratings  Sports cars 39 rated Sports cars Ratings  View and compare all Sports cars ratings.
