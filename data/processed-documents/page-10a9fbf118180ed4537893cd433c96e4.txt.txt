Tuesday, August 27, 2013 The saying goes: Good artists borrow, great artists steal. It seems that songbird Ciara borrowed some elements from Jennifer Lopezs August 2013 W magazine cover for her August 2013 cover of PAPER magazine. Both ladies wear sultry fishnet that leave nothing to the imagination. Ciara flexed her muscles in Christian Siriano and Natalie Joos sheer top, while J-Lo looked simply smashing in a Gucci dress on the W cover. Ciara completed her outfit with a pair of exotic animal print Christian Louboutins. So I gotta ask: who wore it worse?

Michael Brown says he and other family members were celebrating at Wild Wing Cafe in North Charleston, when a shift manager asked the raucous party to move to another section because a white customer was uncomfortable. She said theres a situation where one of our customers feels threatened by your party, so she asked us not to seat you in our section, which totally alarmed all of us because were sitting there peaceably for two hours, explains Brown. Obviously, if we were causing any conflict, we would have been ejected out of the place hours before.

Pastor A.J. Aamir has grown wary of looking out over his congregation at Resurrecting Faith Church and seeing a sea of Yaki hair weave. Our black women are getting weaves trying to be something and someone they are not. Be real with yourself is all Im saying, Pastor A.J. Aamir told AmericaPreachers.com . Pastor Aamir isnt the only one who thinks hair weave is associated with black women who have low self-esteem because they cant grow hair like other races. But it is probably the first time that a notable preacher has spoken publicly about the false image of wearing hair weaves.
