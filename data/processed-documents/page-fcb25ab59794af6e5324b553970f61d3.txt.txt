Indeed, even though Beijing is famous for its traffic jams as there are too many cars, the biggest car market doesnât enjoy the same notable car cultures as the other big automotive markets like the US, Germany, or Japan. If you ask a German or Briton âwhat is car culture?â?, they may reply that they donât know since cars have been part of their daily life since birth and there are too many cars to say anything about car culture. However, for a Chinese person, âI donât knowâ? is a real answer that shows car culture in China is not established enough to match the other traditional auto markets, so news of a new car sometimes might be less interesting than a new moon cake. However, there is a legendary car brand in China that not too many foreigners know about, and is rarely driven around today. Itâs not a cheap car, which many Chinese cars are perceived as being, and it is definitely a luxury brand. It is âHongqiâ (meaning âred flagâ in Chinese). The first Hongqi car was produced by FAW (First Automobile Works) in 1958 and since then it has used by all the chairman of China until now. Itâs what Rolls-Royce is in the UK and what Cadillac is in the US â Hongqi is the brand representing power and wealth in China. Unfortunately, itâs not well-known to the rest of the world compared with these other brands. It had even been forgotten by most Chinese people until it was used by current Chairman Hu on 1 st October last year in Tianâanâmen Square. When more and more Porsches, Ferraris and Aston Martins are seen on Chinese roads, influencing Chinese consumers with their heritage and culture, I think Chinese OEMs and their owners should stop shying away from influencing the rest of the world. 4th Oct 10   Back Leave a Comment Your comments will be moderated before being displayed above.
