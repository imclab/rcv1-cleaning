Objective Art (6Sites,42 Hits)07/27/1998 wr__tj These are sites about selling or displaying art (paintings, music, poetry, fiction, etc.) and/or discussing aesthetics from a basic objectivist point of view  sites focused on romantic realism and Ayn Rand's aesthetic ideas in general. Non-objectivist sites are included as long as the art fits - tonal music, representational painting, clarity of style and of meaning, etc. Russian-born Ayn Rand was a political philosopher who developed the philosophy known as Objectivism. This philosophy forms part of the basis for the libertarian movement. Her novel, The Fountainhead, presents some of her ideas in dramatic form: an architect is presented as having the right to destroy the building because the builders did not adhere to the contract and deviated from his design. Rand's artistic ideas can be considered apart from her philosophy, and this ring concentrates on her aesthetics.
