July 26th, 2013 by Ed Pol So the big question for many people looking for a new car is, should I buy or lease? It is a good question that has plagued many of us buying new cars for years. Yes you can save some money every month by leasing a car but you are paying for something that isnt yours, it is almost like a glorified rental car that you have to pay for every month. But some people like to trade their cars in every 2-3 years so they dont want to buy something to keep especially in the way a car depreciates in value. Luckily you have come to the right place to help you figure out if you should lease or buy that new car you are looking at on the show room floor. I am just going to cut straight to the point and list off the pros and cons of buying and leasing. Here we go: Advantages of leasing a car Lower monthly payments Lower down payment You can drive aÂ  better Â car forÂ  less Â money each month. You can more easily drive a new car every two or three years. You pay sales tax only on the portion of the car you finance. Disadvantages of leasing aÂ car You dont own the car at the end of the lease. Your mileage is limited to a set amount, typically 12,000-15,000 miles a year (excess miles are paid for at the lease termination). Leasing is more expensive in the long run (as opposed to buying and driving until the wheels fall off). Wear-and-tear charges can add up (paid at lease termination). Its costly to terminate a lease early if your driving needs change. You are basically paying to rent a car. Advantages of buying a car Pride of ownership â you can modify your car as you please. Car buying is more economical in the long run unless you buy and trade-in regularly. No penalty for driving excess mileage Increased flexibility â you can easily sell the car whenever you want. If you drive the car well after you are done with your finance term it will be A LOT cheaper. The monthly payments eventually end once the car is paid off. Disadvantages of buying a car Higher down payment is generally required. Higher monthly payments Youre responsible for maintenance costs once the warranty expires. The car depreciates in value every year you own it Trade in of the car wont net you as much as you hope. So there you have it, in my own opinion I think leasing a car is a waste of money, for people who drive around clients may need to lease a car to keep it new every few years and you can have a luxury car for an affordable price. Also, usually once you start a lease you always end up leasing because it is a viscous cycle of returning and re-leasing a new ride which means you will pretty much always have a car payment. I am the type of person that likes to pay for something I can own eventually and not have to make payments anymore. I hope this helps with your car buying decisions.

July 25th, 2013 by Ed Pol So you want to prove how fast a car really is. Instead of pitting it against another car of equal speed and lap times, what can really prove how fast a car is? Why not put it up against a winged beast, a power house of air superiority, yeah thats right why not put it up against a Spitfire plane or a Euro Fighter Jet? Will this actually prove how fast your vehicle is or is it just stupid? Obviously we know that most planes well actually all motorized planes will be faster than a car in a straight line but what about when you add a bit of a handicap to the run? First off we have a video of a 2014 Range Rover sport racing a Spitfire plane. The first problem I see in this video is that the Range Rover is racing on grass, he is going to have a slower take off and I doubt he will hit max speed on this rough terrain. Now I understand that they are trying to show their car is fast off road I just think it would have been better on pavement. To say the least though the video was entertaining and was great to see an old Spitfire in working order running hard to beat that Range Rover. Our next video brings us to one of my favorite car shows, Top gear. Richard Hammond is in a Bugatti Veyron racing a Euro Fighter Typhoon in a 2 mile race, the Euro Fighter has to go vertical for 2 miles before it can return to cross the finish line. I have to say out of the production cars that are out there the Bugatti Veyron is most likely the best bet at winning this race. But I mean come on; youre racing a damn jet! Dont get me wrong I love the Veyron and it is my dream car but there is no way I think any car could win this race. Good luck Richard! What would car vs. aircraft vehicles be without a Red Bull race? This video is a race between a Porsche and a Red Bull racing plane, need I say anymore? I mean really do I have to elaborate on this anymore? I think we already know who will win this race but the video is still fun to watch. The car and plane both start at opposite ends of the run way, the car must go from one end and back again and the plane must take off and go vertical until it canât go any more and come back to pass the plane. Watch below to see who wins this race, if you still dont already know who wins. After watching all of these videos I just have to ask  What does this really prove? Great, a Range Rover is a bit faster than a Spitfire, Bugatti Veyron cant beat a Euro Fighter, and a Porsche has no business trying to race a Red Bull racing plane. Dont get me wrong these things, I guess are entertaining to watch for some people but I had more fun just seeing the planes fly and do what they do other then caring about the race, 99.99% of the population that owns a car will not be racing a plane and this is just irrelevant information. Put these cars in races that actually have some fun value, which Top Gear does all the time. Race it against another car in its category! Personally none of us are racing our cars everyday but I just dont see the point of racing a plane/jet that will usually just annihilate anything it goes against on the ground.What are your feelings on the matter?
