Rumors of the droptop C7 have been swirling ever since Autoweek  first reported the Vette convertibles Swiss reveal, and although not unexpected, many figured Chevy would give the fixed-roof Stingray a little more time under the spotlight before being asked to share. Comparison Test: 2012 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 vs. Porsche 911 Carrera S, 2013 Nissan GT-R Instrumented Test: 2013 Chevrolet Corvette 427 Convertible Comparison Test: 2012 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 vs. 2013 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 The Stingray convertible—which Chevrolet claims is not represented by these renderings that surfaced on the web, despite our thinking otherwise—is set to go on sale as a 2014 model, with production beginning as early as November and cars arriving in showrooms before the end of the year. As Chevrolet works to increase its global recognition, it makes sense that it would choose to reveal the softtop variant of its most-recognizable nameplate in front of an international audience. It’ll be interesting to see how the all-American Corvette convertible holds it own in the presence of all that European hardware.
