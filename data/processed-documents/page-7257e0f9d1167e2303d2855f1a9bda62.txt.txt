Stroll around in this unique portside town and enjoy gallery openings, artist demonstrations and receptions, live music, entertainment and refreshments. The event is FREE to the public. Michael Cannon, Boy Behind Bars Gallery 478 is pleased to present 3rd  Vermont, photographs by Michael Cannon. A long-time resident of the polyglot neighborhood surrounding the intersection of 3rd and Vermont Streets in Los Angeles, Michael Cannon began this series while on camera-toting physical therapy walks following back surgery. Unlike documentary photography, street photography is disinterested in its nature, allowing it to give a true depiction of the world. The exhibition opens First Thursday, June 6, 6  9 PM, and an Artists Reception will be held Saturday, June 8, 4  7 PM.

The district is anchored by the Warner Grand Theatre, a 1,500 seat historic art deco movie palace, Little Fish Theatre, which presents repertory theater in a converted garage, and the Loft Studios, a three-story warehouse with a concentration of fine artists. The District's streets are lined with artists' live work spaces. Featured Show THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE 8/1/2013-9/28/2013 The Loft is the kind of place you'd expect to find in New York's SoHo district, or maybe downtown Los Angeles: a big, old warehouse with wooden floors and high ceilings that's been converted into a thriving art cooperative. "The Medium is the Message" is a show bringing together artists from all different backgrounds and allowing the art to fuse seamlessly. Six artists feature the distinctive properties of fiber, stone, paint viscosity or transparency, steel and wood. While art often uses a medium to make a statement, think Rembrandt or Rodin, these works demonstrate the nature of the materials themselves: squishiness, heaviness contrasted with symbols of lightness, pastiness, layered translucence, plasticity under heat and force, or growth and former use. Beyond the information, however, emotions evoked by each piece; of joy, excitement, tranquility, strength and serenity, make them all immediately appealing. At the same time, that combination of cause and effect invites us back time and again. They are meant to be to lived with. This show highlights a variety of works by Hiroko, Stevie Love, Da Aie Park, Bret Price, Kenzi Shiokava. The Loft is now open every weekend from 2-5pm. Featured Show LABYRINTH OF LINES at the Transvagrant@Warschaw Gallery 6/6/2013-8/10/2013 Much has been written about Philippa Blairs work and the multiple sources that inform it both technically and conceptually. Consensus has assigned influences from Kandinsky to de Kooning, and, more recently, Terry Winters and Albert Oehlen. Unself-conscious, spontaneous, and organic, Blairs painting is recognized for achieving a delicate balance between gesture and structure, intuition and preconception. Vivid, color-saturated brushstrokes and squeegee traces swerve and dodge, collide and coalesce, to re-create both the recalled landscape and the frame of mind she was in originally. Memory, as a storehouse of indelible images, becomes her creative domain. Philippa Blairs work has been widely exhibited in Australia, New Zealand, New York and Los Angeles. She currently lives and works in the port city of San Pedro, California. Organized by Ron Linden. Gallery hours are Monday through Saturday, 11 AM  6 PM. This exhibition sponsored in part by the San Pedro Arts, Culture and Entertainment District and the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce.
