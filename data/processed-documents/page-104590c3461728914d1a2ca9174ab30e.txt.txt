Being one of the more understated concept cars at the show, it looks more 'believable' and closer to production the many of the wildly designed shells gracing the Toronto auto show floor. Being a concept car, the designers were set wild, and the result is a unique electric/diesel hybrid power unit that allows the Cross Coupe to achieve a fuel consumption figure of just 1.8L/100km while developing 306 hp total output - twin-electric motors and TDI diesel combined.
