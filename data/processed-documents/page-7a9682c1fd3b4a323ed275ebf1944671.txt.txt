 Books and Special Issues of Journals The Status of the Lexiconin Speaker-centered Theories Lexis New extended deadline forproposals: 15 July 2013 http://lexis.univ-lyon3.fr/spip.php?article189 Guest-editors : - GeneviÃ¨ve Girard-Gillet,UniversitÃ© Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris 3, France - Catherine Chauvin, UniversitÃ© de Lorraine, France The e-journal Lexis isplanning to publish its nineth issue, which will focus on the status ofthe lexicon in speaker-centered theories, in June 2014. These theories differ from other theories, in so far as they seek toanalyse languages through attested utterances. As a result, they try totake into account the context of the utterances, the relationshipbetween the speaker and the co-speaker, as well as the conversationaldata involved, in order to explain their form and how theirinterpretation is construed. This issue of E-Lexis aims toexplore the extent to which these theoretical choices have an impact onthe way the lexicon is envisaged and how the relations between lexicon,syntax, morphology, phonology, pragmatics, semantics are organised. Arethese domains independent or do they interact ? A number of previous studies have focussed on the search to define an"invariant" or "basic value", underlying various phenomena, and it isnecessary to establish whether it is through these particular analysesthat the lexicon has found its place in the theory. What is a lexical unit in this approach ? What is its status ? Using contextualised examples, the articles can propose specificanalyses, in order to understand divergences from other theoreticalapproaches, or possible similarities. They can also consider relatedepistemological questions. Manuscripts may be written in French or English and should beaccompanied by an abstract of up to 10 lines in French and English, aswell as a list of 5 key words. They should be sent to the GeneralEditor of Lexis, Denis Jamet, as e-mail attachments, (Word and pdf),and will be refereed by members of the international ScientificCommittee. (Manuscripts may be accepted either in their original form,subject to revision or refused). Articles are limited to 8,000 words,excluding references ; data sets and illustrative and complementarymaterial can be accommodated in appendices, for which there is no sizelimit.

The December 2013 issue ofExplorations takes as its theme the notion of limits. The language section chooses as its motto Wittgenstein's famous words:"the limits of my language mean the limits of my world." We thus seekarticles that investigate the connections between language and humanthought and/or explore the ways in which our understanding of suchconnections influences or limits the study and teaching of language inthe academy. The literature section invites articles which critically examineencounters or confrontations involving literary and non-literary worksas they reach the limits of the conventions imposed on them. Whathappens when such limits have been crossed? What kind of extra-literaryspace is opened when a literary text interacts with a painting, a movieor a musical composition and is transformed by them? What is the natureof such interactions? Can we speak of "pure literature"? Or maybe weshould say that the literary work is necessarily infected with othermodes of expression? Is writing just writing? Contributions are expected by June 30, 2013. Notifications ofacceptance will be sent by September 30, 2013.

In small places, close to home  so closeand so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yetthey are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he livesin; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm, or officewhere he works. Such are the places where every man, woman, and childseeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity withoutdiscrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they havelittle meaning anywhere. Without concerted citizen action to upholdthem close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the largerworld." Eleanor Roosevelt, presentation of : IN YOUR HANDS: A Guide for CommunityAction for the Tenth Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights , United Nations, New York, March 27th, 1958. The sixth issue of theon-line journal e-CRIT3224 ( http://e-crit3224.univ-fcomte.fr ) published by the research centre CRIT at the UniversitÃ© deFranche-ComtÃ© (BesanÃ§on), will be devoted to the notion of human rightsas it has been defined, used and embodied in English languageliteratures. Articles will be published in English or in French. Thisissue intends to investigate how this universal notion has been thesetting or subject of poems, plays, novels, short stories orautobiographies written in English, over the ages and acrosscontinents. It will also study how literature has exposed Human Rightsabuse or lauded its defenders. From the spirit of the French Revolution that imbued Romanticism, toslave narratives in North America, to Tony Morrison's quest fororigins, to writings on and from the Celtic periphery, the notion ofrespect for or acquisition of human rights has played central role inboth fictional and autobiographical production written from the margin.Postcolonial literatures, be they Indian, North-American or African,have equally found in the literary form a fertile ground to express theexperience of colonialism and its aftermath or give voice tothose committed to the coming of a fairer society in which the right ofminorities are respected. Human Rights should here be understood as those expressed by theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the following themes could bestudied in relation to fictional treatment: the alienation ofindigenous land by settlers, the oppression of minorities, theeconomic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) of oppressed communities,freedom of expression, womens rights and equal opportunities, domesticviolence, the right to education, the supporters of human rights andthe fight against oppression, at a local, individual level. e-CRIT3224 is the CRIT online journal (ISSN 2107-6537). Four issueshave already been published (plus one special issue) and a fifth oneshould come out soon. Contributors will send an abstract of 400 words, in French or English,with a short bio-bibliography, by July 10th, 2013 at the followinge-mail address: philippe_laplace@hotmail.com ore-crit3224@univ-fcomte.fr .

Trudeau's Doonesbury strip has reflected and refracted America's national narratives,atomising and coalescing them within the strip format to a globalaudience. Chronicling, dramatising and defining key debates of thelate-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries, the Pulitzerprize-winning Doonesbury has also intervened in and shaped theirtrajectory. Using and subverting the narrative strip form as a prismthrough which to explore, catalogue, landmark and define itscontemporary moment, Doonesbury represents a significant artistic, cultural, comedic and criticalachievement. Doonesbury 'sstatus as a symptomatic corollary, imaginative rendition,cultural-historical document, and exploration of America, as well asthe strips diversity of interests, global reach, and culturalreception and standing, offer fertile grounds for fresh contemporaryreadings hitherto unfulfilled by academic engagement. Proposals aretherefore invited for an edited collection of critical and culturalessays to be published through Manchester University Press that engagewith the long-running, iconic strip. The following themes are broadly suggested as points for discussion andpoints of departure for submitted proposals: - Doonesbury : comedy and comment. - Doonesbury 's narrativeform: fragmentation, linearity and cohesion: - Doonesbury 40: ARetrospective: the great American novel? - Doonesbury and the Americanpastoral: from Thoreau to Walden commune and beyond. - Doonesbury , representation,war and trauma: Vietnam, Iraq 1, the war on terror, Iraq 2, Afghanistanand the war within. - Doonesbury and the comictradition: art, satire, liberty and independence. - Doonesbury 's and America'spolitical debates. - Doonesbury and activism:civil and/or gay rights representation. - Reach and syndication: virtual Doonesbury ,the daily strip and the dot com. - Doonesbury , thecounter-culture and the baby-boomers: from protest to Gen X. - On the cover of Rolling Stone: Doonesbury , music,business and cultural representation. - Bright Lights, Big City: Doonesbury and the eighties. - Doonesbury and the Americanpresidency: idealism, reality and representation. - Doonesbury , humour,dissidence and censorship.

Since their controversial inception on the academic cultural stage ofthe last five decades, Performance Studies have always vindicated aninter-disciplinary or anti-disciplinary engagement with theinterstitial and translational aspects of any politics of identity andculture, stressing the centrality of the body, the everyday, and affectin all aspects of human activity. At the same time, performance as acentral, even if contentious, metaphor for almost any form ofcontemporary critical discourse implies not just doing or evenre-doing, but a self-consciousness about doing and re-doing on the partof both performers and spectators (Carlson 2004) calling into questiontraditional interpretations of the ways in which 'texts do things withwords.' Starting from these premises we welcome contributions that discuss thecontested concept of participation from an inter-disciplinaryperspective, investigating how a critical focus on performance andperformativity can help to reframe, revise and challenge existingnotions of publics and audiences (both as spectators and as readers). Suggested topics include but are not limited to: - the impact of performingarts and relational models of spectatorship upon literary studies withparticular attention to digital literature; - the creative and critical interplay between authorial textuality andperformative event; - the relations between recently emerging participatory modes ofspectatorship and other models of social and communal interaction inthe dramatic context of glocalization; - the importance of orality, physicality and affect; - the influences of audience reception theory, feminist and queertheory, cultural and postcolonial studies.

Yet theconfiguration of both as tools of inclusion and/or exclusion positionthem more as sides of the same coin rather than Manichean opposites.This is clearly seen in the way that many monsters are often shown asbeautiful, luring their victims into their dead embrace, just as Beautyitself is revealed as a cruel and thankless master/mistress, whosemonstrous nature is hidden beneath a veneer of aesthetic perfection.Within this, of course, are also the ways that the Monster is itselfshown to be beautiful, not necessarily for any exterior attributes,though this is sometimes the case, but for an inner, spiritualsplendour that points to universal qualities beyond that of simpleperception. This special issue of the Monstersand the Monstrou sjournal will explore all facets of the ways that cultures, throughouttime, have conflagrated the two concepts, to show the ways that themonstrous is truly beautiful and that beauty is the stuff of nightmares. The Editors welcome contributions to the journal in the form ofarticles, reviews, reports, stories, poems and art and/or visualpieces on the following or related themes: - Monsters that use beautyas a lure or trap (vamps, sirens, lamias etc.) - Monster as non-normative beauty, and the beauty of the non-normative - The Sublime and beauty to monstrous excess - Beauty that leads to monstrous obsessions/actions (i.e. Narcissus,Dorian Gray, Snow Whites Evil Queen, Countess Bathory) - The monster as a form of perfection/beauty (i.e. in films such asAlien, poetry of William Blake) - Beauty that hides a monstrous ideology (i.e. in political poetry ofYeats) - Beauty and the Beast: contradictions in the outer manifestation of aninner state - Beauty as a commodity used for monstrous ends - Beauty as human/man-made creation: body modification/enhancement,cosmetic surgery and skin art - Queering beauty and the monstrous: Cultural and social monsters asforms of non-normative beauty - Didactic lessons on beauty via narratives on monstrosity (i.e. fairytales, myths) - Genderisation of monstrous beauty - Death and beauty Submissions for this Issue are required by Friday 6th September 2013 atthe latest.

(posted 9 July 2013) Initial elements in thesentence: intergenre and interlanguage approaches Corpus , 13, 2014 Deadline for proposals: 15September 2013 SophiePrÃ©vost et Shirley Carter-Thomas (eds.) This issue will focus on the correlations between initial elements(i.e. elements that precede the subject and/or verb), or their absence,and certain "linguistic events" which occur in the host sentence and inthe textual sequence (the following and preceding sentences). We invite studies based on one or more substantial annotated anddiversified corpora, which approach the topic from a contrastiveviewpoint (e.g. inter-genre or inter-language). The recommended methodology (studies on annotated corpora, with norestriction on the software tools used) will enable observation andquantitative and qualitative analysis of various phenomena linked toword order and text structuring. Such approaches will enable large-scale studies of the possiblecombinations between the various types of initial elements. They can beconsidered from the following viewpoints: morpho-syntactic (adverb,nominal group, subordinate, etc.), syntactic (complements,circumstances, etc.), semantic (spatio-temporal, enunciative, mannerelements, etc.), informational (topic, focus, etc.), or preferably bycombining several of these perspectives. How many initial elements can be found? Of what types? What are thepossible combinations? The objective is to focus on regularities in the way the varioussyntagms are arranged according to their type, while at the same timerelating them to the characteristics of other component parts of thesentence (e.g. In the case of verb/subject inversion, which IE arelikely to appear?). Consideration should also be given to the influenceof the previous context, by paying attention to the informational andtextual structuring of the preceding utterances. For example, it may bepossible to observe phenomena of thematic (dis)continuity and thecognitive status of the referents involved (where relevant), either inthe initial elements themselves or in the subject of the host sentence. It may also be possible to throw light on the respectivecharacteristics of utterances with or without initial elements, and tosee if they are linked to considerations of genre and language. The studies submitted should have at least one of the followingperspectives: - either a relativelygeneral study of initial elements, of the various possible combinationsand their impact on the sentence in a specific type of text (e.g.history articles in French) - or a more specifically targeted study on a specific initial element(e.g. temporal elements and the position of the subject) in adiversified corpus.

They don't inhabit mind' or 'body'. Theytake place at the limit, qua limit.' Jean-Luc Nancy 'Above all, no body, nobody proper has ever touched -- with a hand or through skin contact --something as abstract as a limit. Inversely, however, and that is thedestiny of this figurality, all one ever does is touch a limit.' Jacques Derrida Treatments of corporeality have piled high in literary and culturalstudies, especially in the last twenty years or so, while questions ofembodiment continue to proliferate in philosophical discussion. At thesame time, metaphorical bodies loom large: humanities scholars haveshown renewed critical interest in variously shaped ideas of the bodypolitic, past and present; corpus linguistics works with ever-larger'corporae' of everyday language. Bodies, 'real' or 'imagined', neverlose the potential to unsettle. However, discussions of corporealitytend to be carried, more or less subtly, by the reassuring promise ofthe material body as a site of indisputable fact. We invite contributions that resist notions of bodies as self-evidentand instead investigate their limits. Poststructuralist theory providesuseful beginnings here: Deleuze and Guattari develop notions of 'bodieswithout organs' that question where a body might end and how it mightrelate to its realities, its limitations and its possibilities.Jean-Luc Nancy has done much to offer ways of conceiving of bodies notas vessels but as limits: as skins which, while they describe spaces intheir various folds, are by definition permeable, open and indefinite.Jacques Derridas late work, meanwhile, can be read as showing limitsas bodies: here, conceptual limits, such as that between 'man' and'animal', cannot police the two-dimensional, idealist division theyproclaim; instead, they are limitrophies, plural, heterogeneous,multiply folded and changing frontiers. Thinking bodies as limits rather than facts has profound politicalimplications. It offers resistance to racist and (hetero) sexistdiscourses that inscribe their ideologies on bodies in order to presentthem as sites of tangible truth; it also challenges representations ofscience as the key to universal and unlimited body knowledge. Further,it offers ways to consider those areas of contemporary life that areincreasingly sites of the multiplication of limits: where relationshipsbetween bodies and machines are increasingly complex, and the linksbetween the two increasingly obvious, what does this mean for notionsof the body/bodies? Tekhne, Derrida notes, is perhaps always aninvention of limits; how then, are the limits of bodies invented intodays technoscience? How are they kept in place? Who/what polices theboundaries? Finally, there can be no thinking of body-machines withoutthinking of body politics, of the ways in which the bodies oflanguages, of nations, of institutions old and new, even of themultiple and electronically folded limits of the digital age, areinstalled as well as challenged. Topics for contributions may include, but are not limited to: - Cultural histories ofbody limits past and present. This includes questions of howcontemporary notions of bodies are, or go beyond, 'the body as aWestern invention'. - If writing takes its place at the limit (Nancy), how is literature,past and present, both product and production of body limits? - Deconstructions and reconsiderations of phenomenologies of bodies andtheir limits (Jean-Luc Nancy, Jacques Derrida, Maurice Merleau-Ponty,Martin Heidegger, Max Scheler, et al.). - Digital technologies and virtual realities: how do we feel the limitsof digital bodies of control? And how do they cut across human andother animal bodies? - Body technologies and the limits they grow -- within 'moderntechnology' as we know it, as well as before and outside it.

Thiscollective work seeks to evaluate some aspects of transnational warculture by examining seemingly light-hearted discourses on the FirstWorld War. Being one of the first turning points of twentieth centuryinternationalism, the Great War, as H.G. Wells once said, has to beenvisioned as "the war of the mind". Cultural life in wartime wassubmitted both to strategies of promotion and blockade to channelinformation and its global circulation. Propaganda and the control ofcommunication also participated in exacerbating patriotism, lifting upsoldiers' spirits and encouraging the civilian support of the conflict.Despite each country's own agenda, morale boosting and motivating thepopulation were the most widely shared things in the world at thattime. Debunking the general sense of perdition and trauma, humor andother forms of entertainment played a crucial role in maintainingpeoples faith in their ability to end the war and stay alive throughthat modern cataclysm. Wartime escapism through culture is often associated with the SecondWorld War. However, during the Great War, recreational activities orartistic creation also served as tools of diversion, triggeringnational pride and hope, among the countries of the Entente or theAlliance powers. They also provided a way to unite the general publicbehind the war effort as well as to strengthen the bonds between thehome front and the battlefront. As the world seemed to collapse,dignity and optimism were preserved thanks to the emancipatory momentsoffered by paintings and other pictorial productions (caricatures,sketches or cartoons), literature and poetry, theater, music andmusical performances, motion pictures, leisure industry resources, aidand relief projects, government initiatives to stimulate daily lifetransformation, etc. We would like to enhance the variety of creative experiments designedto illuminate the present and, thus, cast a positive light on thefuture, allowing citizens to believe the Great War was not the end ofeverything. One of the purposes of the book is to analyze which make-dosubterfuges were proposed to people to persuade them to trust theirleaders and dream forward. Besides, humor and entertainment  from themost waggish expression to the blackest tone  also encompass somepolitical and polemical dimensions, related to social critique, thatneed to be discussed. The authors can focus on local practices or useinternational comparisons to demonstrate how these elements contributedto a liberating experience or a survival philosophy, but also to someideological schemes. Possible topics may include, but are not limited to, the following.Some scholars already submitted proposals: * Motion pictures:patriotic films, pacifist films, short advertising films, war-orientedslapstick comedies, humor and creativity in film distribution andexhibition, role of women performers and directors in war effort(contr: F.

Lacanian analysis of literature and the arts has not been in vogue inFrance for some time now. Following the publication of Ãcrits in 1966, there was a period of analytic fascination with the imaginarycapture of the mirror phase and its intersection with the structures ofthe symbolic in both literary and film studies. Since the 1980s,academic engagement with Lacanian theory in the cultural field has beenin a slump, and this for several reasons: the reputed difficulty ofLacans style as apprehended through Ecrits, the opposition of numerousfeminist critics, and the general decline of theory in the field ofliterary studies. Today, in light of the growing force of scientistic conceptions of thehuman subject (at the level of intelligence, behaviour, reproduction,the limits of the body, mortality), Lacanian theory finds renewedrelevance in its unwavering postulate of the subject as singular,unique and incalculable, insusceptible to scientific conclusiveness. Itis the Lacanian real, generally underexamined amongst first waveLacanians, which gives weight to this proposition insofar as the realis the point at which all systems fail, where the signifier encountersits impasse, and also, the beyond of this point; both what has notencountered signifying discourse and the structural impossibility ofthe signifier to produce an 'all' of meaning. Something always escapesthe signifier. This missing 'something', the objet a in the Lacanian myth of the origins of subjectivity, takes us beyondthe split of structuralism, beyond the subject of the signifier; theLacanian 'speakingbeing' is foundationally dislocated by a mode ofjouissance (civilised by lalangue, the pre-signifying letter oflanguage) that entails "a disruption of self-identity" (Copjec, Imagine There's No Woman: Ethics andSublimation , 2002). It is in this sense, according to ColetteSoler ( Lacan, linconscient rÃ©inventÃ© ,2009), that Lacan affirms "The Real is the mystery of the speakingbody". It is primarily due to the influence of Slavoj Zizek ( Enjoy Your Symptom: Jacques Lacan inHollywood and Out, 1992) and his analyses of film and literature, that Lacanian theorywithin Anglophone studies has been brought back into the domain of thespeakable, the thinkable, and perhaps even the desirable, revalorizingits potential for clarification of the ways in which subjectivity canbe understood structurally (through language) but also as the sitewhere the absolute singularity of the human subject meets itshistorical context: "The contribution of Lacan for our present time istherefore doubly important: on the one hand, it allows us to acquire aclear structural understanding of the [economic] crisis as a crisis ofthe symbolic; on the other hand, it reaffirms the irreducibility of thedesiring subject as such" ( AlainBadiou, Jacques Lacan: PassÃ© PrÃ©sent - Dialogue, 2012) .It is this insistence on the radical singularity of each human subject,intrinsic to Lacanian theory that makes of it a means of thinkingagainst the determinist discourses of our times. This is true not only for the subject of capitalist discourse but alsofor the question of sexual difference. The debate on the implicationsof sexual difference has become, in the contemporary period, enmired ina binary struggle between sex and gender (one might say 'Huston vs.Butler'). Lacan's theory of sexuation, by contrast, consists in anattempt to rethink sexual difference from a non-binary perspective.Other concepts also move critical issues beyond their current point ofarticulation: lalangue, the pre-symbolic letter that marks thesubject in its earliest being undercuts the autonomy of theimaginary-symbolic axis of the subject. If the symptom marks thesubject's "point of exception to the established form of social bondand is connected to the jouissance of the body" (Lissy Canellopoulos,"The Bodily Event, Jouissance and the (Post)Modern Subject," 2010), thesinthome designates the subject's singular way of knotting together theregisters of the real, the symbolic and the imaginary, and on occasion,making up for the absence of the Name-of-the-Father (rejoining thesecond of Badiou's concerns). Such are some of the relativelyunexplored dimensions of Lacanian theory which might illuminate ourreadings of classic and contemporary culture and its objects. In addition to the work of Slavoj Zizek, notable interventions in thefield of cultural analysis include Ellie Ragland's "Eyes Wide Shut, TheWoman Not Seen" ( European Journal ofPsychoanalysis , 2005); Juliet Flower MacCannell's reading ofMargaret Atwood's The Handmaids Tale in "Things to Come: a Hysterics Guide to the Future Female Subject" ( Supposing the Subject, 1994), orthe work of Joan Copjec. As the expression of a desire to give renewed attention to thiscritical orientation and to revitalize its debates and uses forcontemporary analysis of culture, E-rea isseeking articles which analyze literary, filmic, or other artisticproductions from the English-speaking world from a Lacanianperspective. If Encore, as the inaugural text of the period of the'later Lacan' may serve as a point of reference, analyses whichmobilize such key concepts as sexuation, lalangue, other jouissance,ethics, the sinthome, or, that elusive concept - love - will bewelcome. Addressing a wide audience of Anglophone scholars andstudents, concepts should be clarified to illuminate their use in theanalyses. Papers may be written inEnglish or in French.

Gothic studies has long grappled with suffering bodies, and thefragility of human flesh in the grip of medical and legal discoursecontinues to be manifest in chilling literature and film. The directionof influence goes both ways: Gothic literary elements have arguablyinfluenced medical writing, such as the nineteenth-century clinicalcase study. In this second decade of the twenty-first century, it seemsapt to freshly examine intersections between the two fields. The closing years of the twentieth century saw the emergence of medicalhumanities, an interdisciplinary blend of humanities and social scienceapproaches under the dual goals of using arts to enhance medicaleducation and interrogating medical practice and discourse. Analysis ofperiod medical discourse, legal categories and medical technologies canenrich literary criticism in richly contextualising fictional workswithin medical practices. Such criticism can be seen as extending thedrive towards historicised and localised criticism that hascharacterised much in Gothic studies in recent decades. Our field offers textual strategies for analysing the processes bywhich medical discourse, medical processes and globalisedbiotechnological networks can, at times, do violence to human bodiesand minds -- both of patient and practitioner. Cultural studies ofmedicine analyse and unmask this violence. This special issue willexplore Gothic representations of the way medical practice controls,classifies and torments the body in the service of healing. Essays could address any of the following in any period,eighteenth-century to the present: Â· Medical discourse asitself Gothic (e.g., metaphors in medical writing; links between casehistories and the Gothic tradition), and/or reflections on how specificmedical discourses have shaped Gothic literary forms Â· Illness narratives and the Gothic (e.g., using Arthur Franks chaosnarratives of helplessness in The Wounded Storyteller). Â· Literary texts about medical processes as torture/torment in specifichistorical and geographic contexts (including contemporary contexts) Â· Doctors or nurses represented in literature as themselves Gothicvictims, constrained by their medical environment Â· Genetic testing; organ harvest; genetic engineering; reproductivetechnologies; limb prostheses; human cloning, and more. To date the links between Gothic and psychiatric medical discourse havebeen the most thoroughly explored, so preference will be given toarticles exploring other, non-psychiatric medical contexts in theinterests of opening up new connections. Please email 500-word abstract and curriculum vitae to Dr Sara Wasson,s.wasson@napier.ac.uk. Deadline for proposals: 1 October 2013. The official journal of the International Gothic Studies Associationconsiders the field of Gothic studies from the eighteenth century tothe present day. The aim of GothicStudies is not merely to open a forum for dialogue and cultural criticism, butto provide a specialist journal for scholars working in a field whichis today taught or researched in almost all academic establishments.Gothic Studies invites contributions from scholars working within anyperiod of the Gothic; interdisciplinary scholarship is especiallywelcome, as are readings in the media and beyond the written word.

The former appeal to regain their hegemonicplace and lost credibility. The latter emerge from social movementslike Occupy Wall Street, Arab Spring, 15-M, etc., that contest thosenarratives with grassroots intervention.

This issuewill therefore seek new ways of discussing the complex relationshipbetween truth and falsehood, aiming to rethink the social, cultural andepistemological underpinnings of mendacity in early modern England (c.1500-1750). While truth-telling is often assumed to be a universalparadigm (as attested by the Gricean maxim of quality), the codes oftruth and lying are subject to historical change. What might appear tobe an egregious falsehood at a particular time might seem relativelybenign at another. In early modernity, what were the cultural norms oftruthfulness and lying, and on what basis were they constructed? Whatwere the consequences when someone did not share the assumed commonproject of truth-telling and deliberately tried to avoid telling whatthey knew to be the truth, or to claim as true what they knew to befalse?

(posted 25 February 2013) Modern Creatures Volume 19 of EJES Deadline for proposals: 31October 2013 Guest Editors: Virginia Richter (Bern) and PieterVermeulen (Stockholm) The notion of "the creature(ly)" has historically played a decisive butunder investigated role in negotiating the flexible borders between thesupernatural and human and animal life. This issues proposes to focuson the literary, cultural, and material histories of the creature(ly).It wants to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the contestedzone where the natural and the supernatural meet in the modern age; italso aims to develop the notion of the creature(ly) as a powerful toolfor future analyses of the affects, affinities, and anxieties that havemarked this zone since the advent of modernity, and especially sinceDarwin. Contributions can explore, but are not restricted to:  how the notion of the creature(ly) has shaped and reflected changinggender relations and legal institutions of personhood, and has cutacross the binary human/animal.  the affinities between the notion of the creature(ly) and thediachronically related term "creativity," which places the notion atthe heart of modern conceptions of authorship and anxieties aboutartificial creation.  the religious resonances in the notion of the creature(ly); itsrelation to religious notions of Creation and the Creator and politicaltheological approaches.  postcolonial and gender dimensions of the ways in which the notion ofthe creature(ly), like that of the monstrous, has historically servedto police the borders of Western subjectivity.  the relations between animal, human, and supernatural life in popularculture and childrens literature.  the ways in which these relations have been shaped (and oftentriggered) by scientific discourses and practices, and have beensedimented in a broad range of material practices (like zoos). Detailed proposals (500-1000 words) for articles of c. 5000-6000 words,as well as enquiries about this issue, can be sent to the guest editors:  Virginia Richterrichter@ens.unibe.ch  and Pieter Vermeulen pieter.vermeulen@english.su.se.

This issue invitescontributions that work to develop a 'poetics' of partition byconsidering the licentia poetica of the diverse literary and cultural productions relating to thepartitions of South Asia and Cyprus. Both South Asia and Cyprusexperienced partitions and exchanges of populations in theirtransitions from British colonialism to post-colonial nation-states,yet have seldom been studied in counterpoint in the samecontext. The issue thus queries: how is cultural memory formed in the afterlifeof a partition, and what is the role of post-memory and prostheticmemory? How do people remember the world prior to partition, and howdoes this process shape possibilities for the future? What is therelationship between nation-state forms of memory, diasporicimaginaries, and cultural and personal memory for the victims ofpartition? What license has been taken and to what effect to re-imagineways of being in the world in film, fiction, poetry, memoir, andtestimony and how do these unsettle ideas and feelings of home/land,nation and community, or other ways of belonging? Contributions may focus on either of the regions; transregional andcomparative perspectives are also welcome.

GÃ¡mez-FernÃ¡ndez cristina.gamez@uco.es Fiction narratives, films, documentaries and TV series dealing withMuslim issues have increased notably since the events of 9/11, most ofthem with reference to Islamist terrorism. Whether triggered by 9/11attacks or not, Islamic characters in literature and film often embodythe problematic role of the 'Other' and are usually forced into astereotype designed from a Western biased perspective as an epitome offundamentalism and hatred versus the civilization and modernityrepresented by white, wealthy westerners. Narratives like HanifKureishi's My Son the Fanatic (1994) and its 1997 film version, Monica Ali's Brick Lane (2004) and its 2007 filmversion, Jonathan Safran Foer's ExtremelyLoud and Incredibly Close (2005) and its 2011 film version, JohnUpdike's Terrorist (2006),Kiran Nagarkar's God Little Soldier (2006),Don DeLillo's Falling Man (2007),Mohsin Hamid's The ReluctantFundamentalist (2008) and its 2012 film version, Tabish Khair's How to Fight Islamist Terror from theMissionary Position (2012), or Mohammad Hanif's Our Lady of Alice Bhatti (2012) areonly some examples of a wider rich literary exploration. Along with literature, films, documentaries and TV series as Kurbaan (2009), My Name is Khan (2010), Saving Face (2004), Homeland (2011) or Little Mosque on the Prairie (2007), among many others, also attempt to offer (or fail to do so) aninsight about the kaleidoscopic and multifold nature of Muslimidentity. Western constructions are also contested and challenged byintellectuals, academicians and scholars in what has come to be one ofthe defining 21st century issues: Fred Halliday's 'IslamophobiaReconsidered' (1999), Noam Chomsky's TheCulture of Terrorism (1999), Ziauddin Sardar and Merryl WynDavies' Why Do People Hate America? (2002), John E. Richardson's (Mis)RepresentingIslam: The Racism and Rhetoric of British Broadsheet Newspapers (2004), Samir Kassir's Being Arab (2006),Robert Fisk's The Great War forCivilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East (2007), or TabishKhair's Muslim Modernities (2008) display, inter alia, multifarious approaches to this issue. The Journal ofContemporary Literature (Allahabad, India) seeks contributions for its next issue (December2013) that will expand our current understanding of the complex natureof Muslim identities within the international geopolitical andsociological situation through a variety of critical stances. Promptingscholars to engage with connections between history, economics,literature, society, religion, etc., this journal invites articlesdevoted to the analysis of how Muslim identities are shaped, dealtwith, investigated and problematized both in narratives and the screenby fostering multifaceted approaches. Prospective themes are: - post-9/11 traumanarratives and film - Muslim social struggle after 9/11 - fighting stereotypes in the multi-ethnic classroom after 9/11 - re-visiting terrorist tragedies - radical Islam and the radical ?Other? - diasporic Muslim identities - Western vs Eastern victimhood - collective memory/history - similarities between Christianity and Islam - female Islamic identities - Muslim stereotypes and racial ambiguity in Western nations - religion-race identity creations by the West - racism against Middle Easterners Full papers (4000-7000 words) must conform to the latest MLA style.Articles must be sent as attachments to cristina.gamez@uco.esby 15th November 2013.

For reasons that perhaps stem from the burgeoning industry ofscreenwriter's seminars and screenwriting handbooks, increasingattention has been paid to the structure of television writing:showrunners like Dan Harmon (creator and once and future showrunner of Community )expose their Propp-like schematics of episode-writing to an avidaudience, while the Sundance channel has followed in the footsteps ofOrange's documentary series Showrunners with its own documentary serieson television writers, The Writer's Room. How does the traditionallycollaborative writing process of the American television series combinewith the auteurist vision of television present since David Chase and The Sopranos became a householdname? The Emmy nominations announced on July 18, 2013, were unusual inheralding not only the best and brightest in television, but also thestorytelling innovations that television has been showcasing in recentyears. By nominating Netflix's Houseof Cards ,whose entire first season was made available on the VOD service,Hollywood acknowledged the changes in the way television is made,packaged, and enjoyed: the serialized narratives that have becomerelatively standard in recent years no longer require the viewer to'tune in next week.' Instead, streaming, DVD, and VOD services nowallow for marathon viewings that demand increasingly complex narrativesto satisfy sustained and / or repeated viewings. It seems therefore anappropriate time to reexamine the narrative strategies employed in anew golden age for American television. Topics could include: *Structure: the televisionseries has evolved in recent years, both in its beginnings, and itsendings (for example with the generalization of the cold open, or theefforts made to truly conclude a series rather than have it simply end). *Defining one's terms: with efforts like Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8(in comic book format) and Richard Castle's Nikki Heat books appearingin bookstores, where does diegesis end? *Problems of seriality and television narrative: how has televisionsattitude towards seriality changed, and how does the television writersatisfy the weekly viewer, the binge viewer, and the repeat viewer? Hasthe traditional structure of writing in acts and its perpetuations beencalled into question -- for example in premium cable offerings, wherecommercial breaks are no longer an issue? *Frame narratives: to what extent has the return of the often ironicnarrator, from Sex in the City to Desperate Housewives ,hailed a similarly ironic distance from the diegesis? What has been thecultural impact of the suggestive use of analepse and prolepse in aseries like Lost ? *Self-referential television: does quality television necessarily referto itself, as Robert J. Thompson once suggested, and has this tendencyincreased in recent years? This list is not exhaustive. Essays in English of between 5,000 and 10,000 words should be submittedby December 31, 2013 to: - Georges-Claude Guilbertguilbertgc@yahoo.com - AND Shannon Wells-Lassagne shannon.wellslassagne@gmail.com.

Essays will consider the variety of ways inwhich writers responded to the opening of borders and theiraccompanying crossings throughout the century, as well as the ways inwhich familiarity with such Continental landscapes mutated with thedevelopment of texts and culture at home and abroad.

(poste 7 August 2013) Neo-Victorian Humour: TheRhetorics and Politics of Comedy, Irony and Parody Volume 5 in Rodopi's Neo-Victorian Series Deadline for proposals: 28February 2014 Weinvite contributions on the theme of Neo-Victorian Humour for the fifthvolume in Rodopi's Neo-Victorian Series, to be published in 2015. Thisedited collection will examine the manifold modes, functions, andimplications of humour across neo-Victorian media, such as literature,film, anime, graphic novels, videogames, visual art, performance andlifestyle (e.g. steampunk). The volume will explore neo-Victorianism inthe light of contemporary aesthetics as the art of indirect speech,what Umberto Eco famously described as "accept[ing] the challenge ofthe past, of the already said to consciously and with pleasure playthe game of irony" (Eco, Reflectionson The Name of the Rose, 1994) -- but also to engage in more aggressive games of parody,aesthetic travesty, confrontation and denunciation. The omnipresence ofa humorous awareness tends to insist on a crucial difference anddistance between neo-Victorianism and its nineteenth-century referent,thus seemingly arguing against a nostalgic stance. Yet humorous devicescan also be employed to recycle invidious ideologies (e.g. racism,imperialism, classism, sexism) under the politically correct guise ofcomical debunking or subversion, even to the point of carrying forwarda pro-nostalgic agenda. From a technical point of view, humour alsoimplies the establishment of a complicity with the audience, involvingreaders/viewers in complex games that may finally have less bearing onthe diegetic world than on the textual, intertextual and metatextualnineteenth-century worlds being re-imagined. We encourage chapters toinvestigate the inherent contradictions of neo-Victorian humour's aimsand effects, both as a means of self-consciously creativeexperimentation and adaptation of historical events, figures, andartefacts and as a self-defeating nihilistic or anti-historicalproject. Possibletopics may include, but need not be limited to the following:  humour's shaping ofcontemporary views of 'the Victorian' and the long nineteenth century  the postmodern features and implications of neo-Victorian humour  the technical distancing devices of neo-Victorian humour:anachronism, parody, comedy, irony, structural counterpoint, double ormultiple narratives, mise en abyme, and all forms of metatextuality  comic modes, audience complicity, and resistance  neo-Victorian humour and the Gothic  the politicisation of neo-Victorian humour  neo-Victorian humour, empathy, and its limits  comic innovation and the principle of ironic reprise  the role of playfulness and narrative games  ethical and non-ethical humour in neo-Victorianism  humour's functions within and across neo-Victorian genres and media  neo-Victorian humour and trauma  the principle of humour in adaptations and adaptive practice  neo-Victorianism, symbolic justice, and having the last laugh Please send 300-500 wordproposals (for 8,000-10,000 word chapters) by 28 February 2014 to theseries editors: - Marie-Luise Kohlkem.l.kohlke@swansea.ac.uk - and Christian Gutleben Christian.Gutleben@unice.fr Please add a short biographicalnote in the body of your email.

It is aconsideration that inevitably discloses both a sense of dissatisfactionwith what we have, and a trusting optimism in the futures ability todeliver new possibilities. The experimental has connotations of risk,excitement, innovation, and aesthetic progressiveness, but it alsofrequently contains a knowledge of its own possible failure: anawareness that experiments by their nature might go badly wrong.Experimental fiction is a series of attempts at change, and yet thelast sixty years of literary history has been marked by an anxietyabout its own possible exhaustion (John Barth). What if allexperimentation has already been tried? Both the experimental, and itsclose relation the avant-garde, look forward  a potentiallyproblematic stance given a contemporary scene that is preoccupied withits own postness. Indeed, as Brian McHale has recently asked, can theliterature of the postmodern be experimental at all? Both the avant-garde and the experimental thus bear a combativerelation to what has gone before, and to literary history as a whole.The avant-garde contains the promise of both an aesthetic and apolitical radicalness: remembering the terms military etymology, weare cognizant of the neo or contemporary avant-gardes aggressivepotential. Perhaps for this reason, experimental or avant-garde fictionoften rubs people (readers, critics) up the wrong way: it impliestheres something wrong what we already have, and seeks to usurp it. Itrefuses consolation, recuperation, all of the dulling and soporificeffects of traditional narrative, and is subsequently accused,variously, of self-indulgence, political quiescence and solipsism.Sometimes it is too political -- the history of the avant-garde in thetwentieth-century, especially French 'literature of commitment'(littÃ©rature engagÃ©e) -- and sometimes it is not political enough --the characterization of experimental writers and audiences as aloof,anti-reader literary elites. Itself a marginal mode, experimentalliterature has obvious affiliations with other types of writing thathave been pushed out, overlooked or ignored by the mainstream, inparticular womens writing. Nevertheless, as Christine Brooke-Rose hasnoted, many experimental novels are 'surprisingly phallocentric'. Doesthe stylistically experimental necessarily imply the politicallysubversive? Experimental as a term is unavoidably evaluative: either as a synonymfor unsuccessful, unreadable, or elitist; or with its positive butequally problematic associations of progressiveness and intellectualambition. In its positive incarnation it contains an implicitcondemnation of everything that is not experimental; it creates its ownversion of what it subverts or moves on from, conceiving thenon-experimental as a homogenous mass. Keeping in mind Rita Felski'swarning that those critics 'who proclaim the subversive power of formalexperimentation, fail to consider that the breaking of conventionsitself becomes conventional', we ask whether the paradox inherent inthe canonization of experimental and avant-garde fiction means thatpostmodernism has incorporated and recuperated it to the detriment ofexperimental literatures ability to fulfil its remit: that, is, as EvaFiges put it, 'What matters is that the writer should shock intoawareness, startle, engage the attention: above all that he should notengage in the trade of reassurance.' We invite contributionsthat will help to negotiate some of these complexities, including froma specifically linguistic or stylistic perspective. They might include,but are not limited to, the following:  Postmodernexperimentalism / neo avant-gardism  Avant-garde genre fiction -- science-fiction, fantasy, horror  Transgression, subversion, shock: the rise of 'transgressive fiction'  Apocalypse and/or post-9/11 fiction  Futurity, possible worlds and new dystopias/utopias  Videogames into literature : 'ludic literature', ludology and gaming  Multimodal literature, digital technologies, electronic 'codepoetry', collaborative e-fiction  Womens experimental writing and nouvelle Ã©criture feminine  Visual experimentation, typography and the page as experimentalsurface  Commodification and globalization, experiment as resistance  Movements, manifestoes and influence -- Oulipo, Surrealism, Dada,Futurism Althoughwe do not wish to draw up a closed, let alone exhaustive list ofwriters whom we see as specifically representative of the aboverubrics, and who would therefore appear as more desirable objects ofanalysis, the following will give a reliable illustration of the kindsof fiction we had in mind under the label "experimental": - Christian BÃ¶k - Mark Danielewski - Chuck Palahniuk - Lawrence Norfolk - Charles Palliser - Tom McCarthy - Nicholas Royle (author of Quilt) - Will Self - Lydia Davis We welcome interdisciplinary approaches, ranging across criticaltheory, literary and cultural studies, linguistics as well as otherdisciplines in the humanities.

Patsy Stoneman had already tackled the topic by publishing abook entitled The BrontÃ«Influence in 2004 with the help of Charmian Knight. The issue of LISA e-journal "Re-Writing Jane Eyre: Jane Eyre, Past and Present" is further evidenceof Charlotte BrontÃ«'s influence on the writers of the followingdecades or centuries. So far, these studies have been quite limited andthis field of research, "the BrontÃ« influence", offers a widerange of possible developments. Moreover, if the fourauthors' poetry and novels have already been theobject of numerous studies, there is much left to write about theinfluences which were exerted on the BrontÃ«s, whether religious,literary, philosophical or cultural. Taking account of the contextof a work is often a good way of understanding the issuesunderlying a text: the path taken by the BrontÃ«s, their journeys,their stays abroad, the books they read, etc. could prove to be veryenlightening. Besides these external factors, one could also considerthe interactions between the three sisters, who wrote in the same roomand who read passages from their works aloud. A final aspect to identify and study could be the influences which areexerted within the BrontÃ«s' works themselves. How can one accountfor the progress of the heroes and heroines? How is the influence thatcharacters have on one another expressed? What role does nature play inthe destiny of characters? Which other elements intervene in the novels? This dossier devoted to the BrontÃ«s intends to analyse the worksthrough the perspective of influence and three different fields ofresearch can thus be considered: -influences on the BrontÃ«s - the idea of influence in the BrontÃ«s works - the BrontÃ« influence on the writers of the19th, 20th and 21st centuries. Please send your proposals(one A4 page maximum) to Dr. ÃliseOuvrard ouvrard_elise@hotmail.com.
