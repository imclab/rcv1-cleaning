The variety of careers in this sector can accommodate different personalities ranging from eccentric actresses and professional gamers to multi-tasking managers. To be successful in these careers, self-discipline is a must. Work is often project-based, requiring time management skills with the ability to meet strict deadlines. Academic studies are needed to understand and keep up with changing technology used in this industry. A broad academic background, and interpersonal skills are also valuable. Participating in the arts promotes teamwork, communication skills, critical thinking, and decision-making abilities.

Artists and photographers use visual mediums as their tools in the same way writers, poets, and publishers use written mediums.

With the increasing use of art and design elements in daily life, the demand for jobs in this pathway will continue to grow.
