MOVIE THEATERS Once upon a time, you had to drive great distances to reach movie theaters here in Floridas longest county. But no more. Brevards newest planned cinema venue is a 16-screen multiplex set for an October opening in a Viera shopping center. Also set for a grand opening this year is a 16-screen movie house at Merritt Square Mall, in addition to its longstanding 6-screen Merritt South facility. In Melbourne, the Premiere Theaters Oaks Stadium 10 is in the final stages of refurbishing its 10-screen, rocking-chair seating. And last year saw the reopening of a 10-screen theater in Palm Bay called Nova Cinemas. In a reflection of Brevards changing demographics, the Metro Cinema Cafe in West Melbourne will be offering films with Spanish subtitles.
