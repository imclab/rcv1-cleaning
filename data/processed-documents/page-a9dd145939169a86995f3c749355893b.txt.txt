 Auto and Truck Repair and Advice Serving the Gainesville and Hawthorne Florida Area Auto, Car, Truck Repair Advice Welcome to my auto repair website! I started this site in 1996 to assist my customers who had questions about their cars, and help people explain their auto repair problems to a mechanic. "HOW YOUR CAR WORKS" tells how car systems work, fail, and gives approximate repair costs "CAR KILLERS" tells about things that can fail on your vehicle and "kill it" before its time! "ESTIMATES AND ADVICE" is where I answer questions via e-mail. "NOISE LIBRARY" has .WAV files of car noises to help you diagnose YOUR noises. "HOTLINKS" has auto sites and more, and "LINDA'S LEMONS" is just for fun. _________________________________________________________________________
