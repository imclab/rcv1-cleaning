Pre-Qualify Now Auto Sales  Car News Certified pre-owned vehicle buyers may get free trial of Sirius XM satellite radio Certified pre-owned vehicle buyers may get free trial of Sirius XM satellite radio Posted on March 12, 2011 by Auto Specialist Consumers buying a used car may soon be able to take advantage of a free trial allowing them to use Sirius XM satellite radio in their vehicles for a limited time, reports Seeking Alpha. According to the source, approximately 32 million vehicles currently in operation are equipped with a satellite radio. Moreover, more than 60 percent of all new cars being created come standard with this technology, and that figure rises with each passing year. Because close to half of all people who buy cars with a satellite radio become paying customers, Sirius is creating a new program that would allow used car buyers to try out XM radio before they purchase the service. The company has signed agreements with several major car manufacturers  including Volvo , Porsche , Chrysler , General Motors, Ford , Nissan and BMW  that would allow people who buy a certified pre-owned vehicle to enjoy a free satellite radio trial. The source states that it remains unclear how the free trial would operate. One suggested possibility is that the certified pre-owned car dealers may pay Sirius for a short period of service, while another is that the company simply provides satellite radio for free.
