Prior to radio and television most people gained knowledge of the wider world and current events through printed material. Consequently books, newspapers and magazines were an important part of most peoples lives and formed a large part of their wider education. A knowledge of the classics was considered an essential part of a good education. Magazines of the period (especially women's magazines) are full of short stories or serials (usually illustrated) to entertain their readers, along with cooking recipes, interior decorating tips, house designs, biographies, crafts, clothing fashions, and advertising. Children's picture story books like "The Little Red Hen" and "Little Black Sambo" (which would probably be considered politically incorrect today) were popular with young children.
