Novelists experimented with'new' ideas such as liberalism, idealism, and romanticism andwere variously influenced by French, British or German literature.One writer who came to Japan and became the first foreigner totruly capture the essence of the country in his work was Lafcadio Hearn ,better known in Japan by his adopted name Koizumi Yakumo (1850-1904).B>Kwaidan , a collection of ghost stories, is perhaps best known by Japanesepeople. The period between the turn of the century and the dominationof militarism in the 1930's produced three great writers: Mori Ogai , Natsume Soseki and his protoge Akutagawa Ryunosuke . Ogai (1862-1922) gave up an early literary career to concentrateon his work as a doctor with the Japanese army, returning to writingonly after his retirement. He was inspired mainly by German literatureand played a leading role in the Japanese romantic literary movement.He wrote poetry, drama and historical biography, but his bestwork of fiction is considered to be his novel The Wild Geese (1912). It is a poignant story of unfulfilled love, set againstthe background of the dramatic social change that came with thefall of the Meiji regime, as the young heroine is forced by povertyto become mistress to a moneylender. Soseki (1867-1916) - as he is usually known - began his careeras a scholar of English literature at Tokyo Imperial University.He resigned to devote his time to writing and published his firstnovel Wagahai wa neko de aru (I am a Cat) in 1905. It isa satirical portrait of human vanityand was followed by increasingly pessimistic, brooding novelssuch as Kokoro (Heart) and his unfinished masterpiece, Meian (Light and Darkness). Soseki's works often dwell upon the alienationof modern humanity, the search for morality, and the difficultyof human communication. Soseki's portrait graced the front ofthe 1,000 note for many years. Akutagawa (1892-1927) is best remembered today for the literaryprize in his name that is awarded to young fiction writers. Hewas a prodigious student and studied under Soseki at Tokyo ImperialUniversity. His most famous work is Rashomon and Other Stories (1915), the title story of which was one of the sources of KurosawaAkira's masterpiece. In this book of short stories, he questionsthe values of his society, dramatizes the complexities of humanpsychology, and studies, with a taste for Zen-like paradox, theprecarious balance of illusion and reality. During the 1930's and 40's, the domination of the military meantthat literature was largely stifled. The two great writers toemerge in the postwar period were Kawabata Yasunari (1899-1972), who was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in1968, and Tanizaki Junichiro . Their most famous works are Kawabata's Yuki-guni (Snow Country, 1935-47) and Tanizaki's Tade-kuu Mushi (Some Prefer Nettles, 1928). The former tells of a relationshipbetween a middle-aged writer and an aging geisha. The latter usesthe cities of Tokyo (which had just been devastated by an earthquake)and Osaka as symbols of the conflict between modern and traditionalJapan. Perhaps better known abroad is Mishima Yukio (1925-70), whose life and death were as dramatic as his art.He was a homosexual and obsessed with the body, physical beautyand its inevitable decline and death. His first major work was Kamen no Kokuhaku (Confessions of a Mask, 1949) and he handed his last, the 4-partnovel Hojo no Umi ( The Sea of Fertility, 1965-70), to his publisher on the dayof his death. Another masterpiece, Kinkakuji (The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, 1956) tells of a monk disgustedby his own ugliness who burns down the famous Kyoto pavilion ratherthan see it fall into the hands of the US military. Mishima despairedat the westernisation of Japan and longed for a return to noblertimes. He was perhaps the only writer of his day who was capableenough to write kabuki plays in the traditional style. He wasexcused military service during the war and the guilt of thisplagued him throughout his life. He took up bodybuilding and martialarts and liked to pose in photographs depicting his violent end.With life imitating art, he committed ritual suicide togetherwith members of his fanatical private army after failing to createa revolt by the military. Left to right: Kawabata receives the Nobel Prize for Literature;Mishima Yukio; Yoshimoto Banana and the cover of her book Kitchen. In 1994, Oe Kenzaburo (1935- ) became Japan's second literary Nobel recipient. Representativeof his works are Kojinteki na Taiken (A Personal Matter, 1963) and Manen Gannen no Futtoboru (The Silent Cry, 1967). Both novels dealt with the theme of beingthe father of a brain-damaged child, which Oe knew about fromexperience. In his novels, Oe creates a world rich in poetry andimaginative power, where reality and myth are inextricably intertwined.He also wrote about the polarity felt by 20th century Japanesebetween their own culture and the outside world. Recently he wrote Tsugaeri (1999) based on the 1995 sarin gas attack by a religious culton a Tokyo subway that killed 12 people. Among the most popular authors in recent years are Murakami Haruki , Murakami Ryu (no relation) and Yoshimoto Banana , allof whom are known for their harsh insights into modern Japanesesociety. Murakami Haruki (1949- ) is perhaps the most read outsideJapan. The novels Noruwei no Mori (Norwegian Wood, 1987) and Hitsujio Meguru Bouken (A Wild Sheep Chase, 1989) are among his best known. MurakamiRyu (1952- ) won the Akutagawa Prize in 1976 for his novel Kagirinaku ToumeiniChikai Buruu (Almost Transparent Blue, 1976). Other works include CoinLocker Babies (1980) and Topaz (Tokyo Decadence, 1988). He often appears on TV and writes inmagazines discussing the current state of Japan and its youth.Yoshimoto (1964- ) is usually either loved or hated by readers.Her dark novels have dealt with themes such as death, incestand lesbianism. Her first breakthrough came with the 1987 novella Kitchen , still her best known book.
