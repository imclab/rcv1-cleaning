Degree Contact: This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it Phone: 732-906-2589 Course Outline (PDF) Course Outline 2012-2013 (PDF) The Associate in Fine Arts (A.F.A.) offers the first two years of concentrated study in studio courses for students planning to transfer to avisual arts, theatre, or music baccalaureate program. As a fine arts major, the student may choose to concentrate in either theater, art ormusic. What will students learn if they study Fine Arts? The Associate of Fine Arts Degree (AFA) prepares students for transfer to Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) programs at four-year institutions. Just as the Associates in Arts (AA) degree is composed of the first two years of study toward the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, the Associate of Fine Arts (AFA) is composed of the first two years of concentrated study in studio courses appropriate to the BFA in art. This includes coursework in drawing, design, painting, sculpture, printmaking, ceramics, and mixed media. The Associate of Fine Arts degree (AFA) will provide a well –rounded education with a generous range of liberal arts courses required by four-year BFA programs. Specifically, the AFA degree contains a series of general education “core” requirements, which all AFA students must complete. In terms of academic requirements, the major difference between the AA degree and the AFA is that the AFA requires more “hands-on” studio courses while reducing the number of courses in math and science. The AA degree requires four courses in math and/or science. The AFA degree, however, requires only two courses in math and/or science for graduation. Are there any requirements that must be satisfiedbefore taking courses in the major? Algebra I is a prerequisite for all majors. Algebra I competency maybe verified with a passing score on the College’s placement test orcompletion of the appropriate course. How long will it take to complete this degree? Once students complete developmental coursework (if needed), thedegree can be completed in two years of full-time study. They canshorten the amount of time by taking courses in the summer andwinter sessions.   For further details contact Nadine Heller, Chair of the Visual, Performing and Media Arts Department at (732) 906-2589 or This e-mail address is being protected from spambots.
