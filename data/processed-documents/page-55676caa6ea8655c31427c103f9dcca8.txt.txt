Advertisement Find the Automotive Exterior Accessories You Need for Your Ride Whether you're hauling bicycles or you want protection for your car, find the automotive exterior accessories you've been looking for at Sears. Sears offers a complete range of name brand exterior accessories such as bike racks, car covers, truck bed protectors and hitch carriers. Keep bugs and grime from penetrating the radiator with a Lund's screen grille insert, and protect the truck bed from scratches and other damage with the Bedrug truck bed mat. From X-Cargo car top carriers to Advantage SportsRack bike racks, customize your ride with automotive accessories from Sears. Overhaul the Interior Not all automotive accessories consist of hubcaps, grille inserts, truck beds and window tint. In fact, you have hundreds of interior accessories that transform the look of your car or truck. Universal seat covers offer visual enhancement and protection at the same time. Whether you drive a Honda sedan or a Ford truck, Plasticolor and Bell offer seat covers that create a brand new look in your automobile. Select from traditional solid colors, or choose from camouflage, dolphin and Tweety Bird print for a custom look. With car seat covers, you hide rips and tears and protect your seats from further damage. Transform the Exterior Bring even more attention to your ride by completely changing the look of the rims. Whether you prefer chrome, machined or painted wheels , each one offers something new and interesting for your car or truck. Select from a variety of finishes with sizes ranging from 14 to 24 inches. Carro Pacific, SSC Performance and TRAKLite Wheels offer black chrome and painted machine rims to fit most any size car or truck. Whether you're looking for black rims for your street racer or chrome rims for the sedan, customize the look of your ride with new wheels from Sears. Accessorize with Performance Enhancements While some automotive accessories improve the look of your car, other accessories offer peak performance and a smoother ride. With performance enhancements such as Road Handler tires , springs, alignment kits, shocks and struts, you improve the responsiveness of your vehicle on the road. Lessen the impact of holes and bumpy roads with Monroe shocks, and complete the suspension system with an Eibach anti-roll kit. In addition, StrongArm lift supports provide smooth operation and optimum performance by automatically opening during the compression cycle. With Air Lift front and rear air spring kits and Rancho Shock Series shocks and struts, increase your car's performance, and maximize its efficiency. Regardless of whether you want to increase your car's performance with new shocks and air intake systems or you just want to add a little more style with chrome rims and car seat covers, you have access to the parts you want for your four-door sedan or 4x4 work truck. Shop Sears online or at the store for an even more affordable selection of shocks and struts, performance enhancements and more automotive accessories.
