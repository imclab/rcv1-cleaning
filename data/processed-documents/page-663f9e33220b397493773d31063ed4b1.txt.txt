Joel (Chicago) 12/5/2010 7:24 PM When r u guys gonna make a kit for the early model altima coupe! FINALLY! Anonymous (Unknown) 10/14/2008 9:41 AM I have been waiting for someone to come out with an aftermarket lighting option for the new Altima and finally found you guys! I was not keen on installing this kit at first but its actually not that bad. The car turns heads everywhere now and I am constantly getting asked where I got the lights. These are a whole lot brighter than other kits I saw on cars, I was really suprised. Thanks!Norman T Great Service Anonymous (Unknown) 10/15/2008 5:57 PM Just purchased it today and probably called them at least 5 times and spoke to different reps and they all seem extremely informative and willing to help. I will add another review once I receive the product and done installing it.

This kit utilizes Cold Cathode technology which, unlike the other LED and Fiber Optic Kits, can be seen vividly... even in Direct Sunlight! These rings are rated at 50,000 hours of continuous use, that's more than twice the lifespan of the competition... these halos should outlive your car! Do not mistake this product for some "Do it yourself" LED knock off Demon Eye Kit, this is a High Quality Product produced by the new leaders of the industry! What kind of "look" can I expect? These Demon Eyes use CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lighting) core technology. CCFL produces a very bright light from the gas charged tubes. The look is very "high tech" and matches HID equipped lights exceedingly well. Additionally, this technology provides for very bright output from the halo rings so they're visible day or night. What does the kit include? Kit includes the following: - (4) Altima Halo Rings - (2) V2 Demon Eye Ballasts - Altima Specific Wiring - Installation Instructions - Install DIY Video   Home - About Us - Contact Us - Gallery - Products - Services - Ebay - FAQ - Media - Privacy Policy - Sitemap 2013 AAC Enterprises Inc., a Delaware Corporation.
