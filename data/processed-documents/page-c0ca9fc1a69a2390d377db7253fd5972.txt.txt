View Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat User Review for Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat 5.00 rating Grandmother by no This is the carseat my daugher wanted for her son View Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat User Review for Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat 5.00 rating Best carseat out there by MomOfOneWeeOne This is the second Britax I've purchased, as we have a Roundabout in my husband's car. I only wished we had purchased a Britax sooner! My daughter hated riding in the car as a newborn, but from the moment we put her in the Britax, she's been a happy passenger. I like that she'll be able to use the Marathon for such a long time, and can ride rear-facing up to 35 lbs. (Please put your children rear facing as long as the weight limit allows!! It's so much safer, despite the temptation to turn them around as soon as they hit the 1-year & 20 lbs mark. Please do your research!) We have zero complaints about the Marathon, it's a sturdy seat and easy to install - just follow the directions. The customer stories on the Britax website are worth a read too - this seat can literally save your child's life. Worth every penny. View Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Car Seat Facts Positioning Did you know that according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), babies should ride in a car seat that is installed in the rear-facing position to the maximum weight and height allowed for that car seat ?

An infant car seat accommodates a child that is between 5-22 lbs. and up to 29in. tall. It is important to follow all manufacturer guidelines and state regulations to ensure the safety of your baby . These car seats often feature a canopy which is adjustable or has the ability to rotate. The canopy will protect the car seat from all types of weather. Safety features such as the LATCH system are featured in many of the infant car seats .

This type of car seat will be the next step in car seats before your child is able to use a booster seat . Most models of convertible car seats can fit a child that is between 5-65 lbs compared to the infant car seat , which can only fit a child that is between 4-22 lbs.
