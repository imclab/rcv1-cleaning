Dig up to a greater extent about T-Shirt Time, Gorilla Juice Heads, GTL and all the vernacular from Jersey Shore, pick your liked expression and get the T-Shirt sporting your favorite phrase. Remember, it's all about the shirt before the shirt!! ...  GTL in the first part of the day and T-Shirt Time at Night!! This story is all about the shirt you wear before the shirt. That's right, it's 12:10 and people knows it's T-Shirt Time!! What is T-Shirt Time? You got your fresh to death shoes on, you got some jeans on, and you got the shirt. But, you ain't wearing the shirt when you go out - it's the shirt before the shirt. Even Vinnie is on the shirt before the shirt. You've got an plenitude of Wife Beaters, they're white or black tank tops. You wear them before you go out. You sit on the chesterfield in your tank tops until it's T-Shirt Time! Right afore you go out, you take off the tank and put on your fresh shirt. Yeah, shirt last minute Dog, what is this your first Cowboy exhibition? Gorilla Juicehead These aren't Zoo Animals, they're functioning wild on the beach! Gorilla Juiceheads, for those who don't be acquainted with, are enormous, tall Guidos all pumped up on Growth Hormones or Steroids. Though inherent to New York & New Jersey and frequently regarded cruising the boardwalk in Seaside Heights, plainly there are several Gorilla Juiceheads to be observed in the Southern Florida area. Guidettes like J-Woww and Snooki perpetually seem to be on the hunt for tan Guidos with their swole on and I'd bet Sammie would likely appraise Ronnie her very own Gorilla. "To my knowledge, there really isn't a guido culture up there," J-Woww recently declared in Rolling Stone. "I came down here for college, and I had a boyfriend that was severely into it, and that's how I got accustomed to it." As considered by Jenny in term one, "I see a bunch of Gorilla Juiceheads. tall, completely jacked, steroids, like multiple growth hormones. That's, like, the type that I'm attracted to."-J-WOWW, Jersey Shore GTL Gym, Tanning, Laundry As Vinnie says, " . . . it's how they make the Guidos". There's not much appeal in taking HGH and Roids if you don't go to the gym to get ripped. If you don't go to the gym, you aren't going to look very admirable. Tanning is an inherent part of the ritual, because you don't want to look pale. A robust glow draws the enthusiasm of the Guidette in heat. For some Guidettes, such as Snooki, the tan even plays a critical role in their ethnicity. Listen Bro, everybody needs shining clothes, right? Clean Laundry each day is a big deal if you want to be fresh to death. If you need to be a Bink, youse gotta have unspotted threads, my dude. GFF Grenade Free Foundation What is a Grenade? A grenade is an extensive, deafening and often very unattractive woman (and sometimes prone to brute force), who is doing her best to keep her hot buddy from hooking up with you at the club. She knows she ain't snatching any and she wants to make sure not one of her girlfriends do either! A Wingman is mostly treated to be vital when a Grenade is met with. The Wingman is likely to "dive on the Grenade", thereby distracting her from her prior foiling maneuver. If the Wingman is victorious in his hold, your chances of getting to Smush are greatly upgraded. The GFF, or Grenade Free Foundation is a small but growing group of Guidos who are dedicated to helping themselves and their peers avoid taking home, repelling, rambunctious, ample and desperate women while being too drunk to realize it. Happily, there is no registration action or fee to become a member of the GFF, one simply has to set new principles and fend off the many Zoo Animals meandering the clubs. This shirt is simply a way to independently depict your chosen lifestyle and honor this philosophy to like minded people everywhere you wear it. There has been some argument of Grenades of the male persuasion, but there is little grounds to show males mixed up in in any form of blocking game with their comrades, Especially after letting each other know it's T-Shirt Time !! DTF If you aren't DTF, you most likely have a pretty flat life . . . just sayin'. What does DTF mean? We're taking the position that no one is really sure about what this abbreviation means. Dance 'til Four? Drink 'til full? Driven to Fistpump? This one is fun because you get to figure what DTF means. Isn't that just great? Dirty Little Hamster The opposite of a Clean Little Hamster The Situation comes up with some pretty damn funny one-liners and Dirty Little Hamster is one of our favorites! If you happen to be the type of joker who leaves used personal hygiene material lying around in public places where your roommates have to deal with them and you under no circumstances pick up your home, you probably don't know it, but you're a Dirty Little Hamster! Most Dirty Little Hamsters are so used to living at home with their kin, that they simply don't know how much work it is to clean up after themselves. It's in all likelihood true that most Hamsters are not aware of the fact that they have come to hope for someone else to clean up after them.
