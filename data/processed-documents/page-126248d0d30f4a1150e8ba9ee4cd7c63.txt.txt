Concise and easy to follow with great reading, although they could maybe be at a little higher reading level. We will be using the 8th grade book for next year along with the WordSmith. January 8, 2013 I really wanted to like this curriculum, especially considering the rave reviews and its literature foundation. However, my son complained on the first day of school that it was way too easy. The large print makes the book appear to be designed for much younger students. The recommended spelling lists are extremely short and too easy for a seventh grader. My son does not want to rewrite the literature passages from dictation, nor can I see the point in making him do so. Unfortunately, the dictation takes up a whole page for each lesson. To avoid the complaints, I instead have my son mark the parts of speech or diagram the sentences in the literature passage. I became disillusioned with the teacher book when I found two spelling errors in the introduction! The pages in the teacher book don't correspond to the pages in the student book, which makes it difficult for me to plan the day's lesson without looking in the student book for the correct page numbers. Most of the books needed for this curriculum are not what I would consider classic works of literature. One of the quoted books is out of print and difficult to find, and I recommend not trying to find it. Several of the books listed in the bibliography are about creationism, which seem out of place in a literature-based language arts book. The concept behind this curriculum is good, and has so much potential, but there needs to be more depth and content than I find in The Green Book. I am having to supplement this curriculum with other language arts books, and find other works of literature for my son to read. It has become a lot more work for me than I intended! September 1, 2010 Lessons are well marked out. They are a nice size for one day and a good variety. Some of the instructions are not the clearest, but maybe that is just us since it is our first year with them!Binding makes it difficult for kids to manage. This would be much better as a spiral bound. When you have the binding cut off to place in the 3 ring binder, the prepunched holes get cut, rendering them uselss. But, if I am going to get the binding cut off, then I would rather get a spiral bound than put in a binder - spiral bound is more sturdy, and less expensive than having to buy the binder. August 27, 2010 So far so good,,we are enjoying it. The lessons are easy to understand and they are to the point. You don't feel so bogged down like you do with some other products.
