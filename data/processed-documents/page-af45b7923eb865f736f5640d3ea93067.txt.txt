Are there any special websites or well known car markets in capital cities that people know about? Im looking to spend no more than $5000 USD and then maybe re-sell the car after a summer spent photographing in Eastern Europe.

Apr 25 2006) | saarbruecken,Germany| | Report spam While Germany might be a good place to buy a car, I think it will be hard to get a registration there. First of all you need to have an oficial adress in Germany and just that means that you have to spend long hours with German bureaucrats. The best thing would be if you know someone in Germany who can register the car under his name. Also consider that you have to pay taxes. They can be quite high especially for older cars. Some vans do have a truck registration, which makes it a lot cheaper. It might be easier somewhere else. by Daniel Etter |27 Apr 2006 12:04 | Krakow,Poland| | Report spam Ok. Thanks Daniel. . . by Davin Ellicson |27 Apr 2006 14:04 | London,United Kingdom| | Report spam Ive purchased a car in Eastern Europe, and would highly recommend to NOT buy one there, but would definitely recommend to sell it in eastern Europe  although, what do you mean by Eastern Europe? How far east are we talking, as Poland is quite a lot different from Russia or Ukraine or Romania or Slovakia. Some eastern countries are in the EU, some not, and this makes for interesting rules. I would be careful about Ukraine  they have one of the highest import duty taxes on cars for the carnet de passage, I think its around %30 of the value of the car. This makes cars in Ukraine VERY expensive for basically nothing  on the flip side, you can make some money on the deal. I bought a car  1989 Lada Samara  for $3000 and flipped it for $4000 a few months later. That being said, I dont know too many Ukrainians whod want a VW camper. Anyway, those are some things to consider. I rode my motorcylce across Africa in 1998, and the killer thing was the carnet de passage, which is basically insurance for the vehicle and that you wont sell it at your final destination. Each country has a different % of the value of the vehicle for an import fee, some are really low, others astronically high. When you pay for it, they take the highest % country and work from there. I valued my bike at $2500, then the highest country I think was about %15, so I had to pre-pay beforehand  when I proved that I didnt sell my bike, I got my money back. I dont know if this is pertinent to your situation, but maybe something of importance. Also, for pure research, check out Ewan MacGregor nd Charlie Boormans (yes, the actors) book on them driving around the world on motorbikes. They actually have a pretty detailed section about all the bureaucracy of travelling through eastern Europe and what it took to get through. Good luck! by[former member]|27 Apr 2006 15:04 | Toronto,Canada| | Report spam Donald, Ill be in Romania and other non EU Eastern countries. . . thanks for the info. Davin by Davin Ellicson |27 Apr 2006 15:04 | London,United Kingdom| | Report spam you CAN buy a car in the east, you dont register it under your own name, you get the original owner to give you a notarized letter giving you authorization (power-of-attorney) to deal with the car. Insurance (the green card) which should be good throughout Europe, east and west, should be pretty cheap, cheaper than in Western Europe. ($200-$500 for a year) Many older VW Golf or Jetta in east europe come from Germany, Switzerland, or Netherlands and for less than $2000 you should get a decent car. get an old enough one and you dont need unleaded gasoline. be sure you get some kind of emissions sticker  some countries like to see one. you dont need carnet de passage for anywhere in europe and turkey except maybe Russia (?)  you do need it in the middle east if you want to drive through syriaThere is NO MORE BUREAUCRACY in Eastern Europe, at least as far east as the old USSR border. Poland, Czech, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, ex-Yugoslav republics, Hungary, Turkey, are all visa free or visa-at-the-border for US and EU citizens. in my case i had a bulgarian VW Jetta 1983, that i drove to 20+ european countries in 1999-2001. you should have seen the looks, that notarized statement in cyrillic letters, as this chinese guy with an american passport and a bulgarian car drove all through both eastern and western europe. But gas is a lot more expensive now then it was 5 years ago, keep that in mind. in austria youre supposed to pay for autobahn sticker, i never did. same in hungary. Romania was pretty easy to drive around. Transylvania is very pretty. for bulgaria, macedonia, and serbia, and working knowledge of cyrillic alphabet is needed to read road signs. Good value these days may be post-Communist Czech SKODA cars, they are owned by VW and are VW in everything but name. I would avoid Romanian Dacia, Russian Lada, Yugo Zastava, and i dont think you can even drive Trabants any more. Fiat, Peugeot, and Renault are all OK but you may as well go german. Russian NIVA is actually a great 4-wheel drive jeep, if you need 4-wheel drive. I would get a regular car rather than a van/bus type thing because you can sleep almost anywhere without getting bothered too much (especially if you have a suit hanging in the back seat and press credentials, just say youre taking a nap before meeting the foreign minister in the capital in the morning) and rural hotels are very cheap and because you can drive AS FAST AS YOU WANT . Romania does have moderately decent roads and theres nothing more fun than passing everyone at 130 or 140 kph on those mountain roads. you cant do that in a van! this is assuming you have good driving skills and a good car of course, im not recommending unsafe driving. Also bring a tent and a sleeping bag, and youre totally self-sufficient. in the summer months i bathed in lakes. by[former member]|27 Apr 2006 19:04 | New York, NY,United States| | Report spam Many thanks Alan for all the info.

Best, Davin. by Davin Ellicson |27 Apr 2006 19:04 | London,United Kingdom| | Report spam Hi all, Im reviving a post of mine from two months ago. I want to buy a car in Europe to drive around Eastern Europe this summer and I am wondering if I should buy in a Western European country such as Germany or in Hungary or RomaniaI will mostly be in Romania?! Apparently, I need a Green Card (insurance), but not a carnet de passage. But what about the previous owners documents, an emissions sticker and registration since I dont have an address in Eastern Europe or Germany? Am I forgetting anything? How hard is all this to do? Ive checked out some of the sites that sell cars, and I basically want to be able to show up and buy a car and get everything taken care of in a few days at most. . . Davin. by Davin Ellicson |11 Jun 2006 20:06 (ed. Jun 11 2006) | London,United Kingdom| | Report spam Get your Car Registered in Germany Step 1: Get an Official German Address. For this you have to register in any German town, best would be where you buy and register the car. In order to get this you need a to fill out a form in the Einwohnermeldeamt (registration office). In some states you have to have a signature of your landlord on this form to get registered, in others you can show it later (noone will ever ask for it). Remember: German clerks speak very bad English, that is if they speak. Step 2: Buy your Car of Choice Make sure it has ASU and TUV for two years. These are tests the car has to pass every two years (fromer for exhaust fume, latter for security). Remember: No registration without ASU and TUV ! From the previous owner youll get the Fahrzeugbrief which proves that he is the owner of the car. Remember: The Fahrzeugbrief and NOT the Fahrzeugschein is the prove of ownership. Step 3: Insurance You need at least indemnity insurance. Actually I have no clue where you get that. I guess at an insurance company, but I think the car dealer of your choice will help you. Step 4: Get your Car Registered With all these papers you have to go to the Strassenverkehrsamt. If you have all the correct forms (Fahrzeugbrief, insurance papers, ASU , TUV , address), it is easy from here. You just go there, show them the forms, fill out some more forms, pay, get a license number, go to the license plate maker, buy a license plate, go back, get four little stickers, pu them in the right place on the plates, attach the plates to your car and off you are to Eastern Europe. But remember: German clerks speak very bad English, that is if they speak. Step 4: Pay Taxes Self explanatory. by Daniel Etter |11 Jun 2006 23:06 (ed.

Either saturday or sundayjust turn up with some discreetly hidden cash and you could get yourself a bargain  at least youll be able to take a look at the goods properly before buying. As I say, I dont know if it still happens but it used to be a regular occurance. by[former member]|12 Jun 2006 00:06 | London,United Kingdom| | Report spam Sion, do you know of any car markets in London where I could find European style left side drive cars? Davin by Davin Ellicson |12 Jun 2006 00:06 | London,United Kingdom| | Report spam davin, read my post above carefully. this is the way to do it, unofficially, as opposed to Mr. Daniel Etters excellent instructions on how to do it officially. both methods will work. his is safer and obviously proper. mine was clearly cutting corners, to say the least, although it was absolutely legal. Laws regarding all this may have tightened up a bit since i did it, but there are always ways to do things cheaply when necessary. . also, since you live in the UK, why dont you just drive your British car across Europe? the right  hand drive is annoying but youll get used to driving it in Europe easily enough. in bosnia i inherited kit roanes british toyota pick-up truck with right hand drive, even took it to italy. no problem. by[former member]|12 Jun 2006 04:06 | New York, NY,United States| | Report spam Hi Davin Try Montenegro. On the weekend the road from Podgorica to Cetinje is lined with second hand car dealers, apparently these days they are all legit, and you can pick up a good car for a few thousand euros. You can register on the dealers name and get a letter of authorisation, the Green card should be pretty cheap there, maybe around $400. That should only take a couple of days to sort out, and then youre good to go. Also Montenegrin plates are pretty handy, especially in the Balkans, because no one hates them enough to smash your car upexcept, that is, the Croats. You shouldnt take a car with Serbian or Montenegrin plates anywhere on the Croatian coast if you want it to last more than a day. by[former member]|12 Jun 2006 07:06 | Prishtina,Kosovo| | Report spam Thanks Daniel, Alan and Andrew. . . Davin. by Davin Ellicson |12 Jun 2006 07:06 | London,United Kingdom| | Report spam Davin, I unterstand what you want to do, but: Im pretty sure, that as foreigner you will get ripped off if buying a car in Germany or where ever. You need definately somebody to make this deal for you, in the language of the country youre going to buy in. Especially insurance will be expensive as hell for you. You start as a beginner, for the insurance at least. This means 200% up on your rate, in Germany for sure. Find somebody you trust and who trusts you, and let him buy a cheap car and register it on his name, same thing with the insurance. I have been to Romania and driving around there, aint no fun, I mean it can be dangerous, especially after dark. One night on the way to the Hotel I almost hit a car, parked in the middle of the road without any lights on or nearby. Hell, I mean there was a house close by , but you didnt see the car at all, it was pitchblack around there. Next day on the way to an interview, I had to go the same road back and the car was still there. But it was only crap metal anymore, it got hit by another car and both cars were sitting there in the middle of the road, totally devastated. I still hope nobody got seriously injured. Maybe the Andrews idea is the way to go. Buy on the balkans and after youre finished you got anice present for some friend in Romania Regards Heinrich by Heinrich Voelkel |12 Jun 2006 08:06 | Barcelona,Spain| | Report spam davin, i like andrews idea of buying a car in montenegro.at the end of your trip you could try and sell it on in serbia,as second hand cars here are expensive.the more money you can spend the better,because goood cars are relatively cheaper than 20 year old clapped-out clunkers.plus,repair bills could be expensive if the mechanic knows you are a stranger.i wouldnt recommend a camper van,as they tend to classify them as buses on the motorway toll roads,can get very expensive in tolls.try buying your green card in montenegro or serbia,a green card for a serbian car is about 12 quid for 6 months!a bargain i would say. sounds like you are going to be spending a lot of time on dodgy eastern european roads,get a lada niva,44.you can even find them now with renault(i think) diesel motors.built like tanks,so useful when you encounter a rakia sodden local driving with no lights at night on a mountain road.the roads of the balkans are not festooned with roadside shrines for no reason. by Michael Bowring |12 Jun 2006 09:06 | Belgrade,Serbia| | Report spam don use e-bay,not if this chaps experiences are anything to go on. http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItemitem=4633452260. its worth reading down to the bottom. by Michael Bowring |12 Jun 2006 10:06 | Belgrade,Serbia| | Report spam why would you get ripped off buying a car, heinrich? cars are cars, if you are an experienced driver (and tinkerer) you know what to look for  rust, condition of wires, brakes, exhaust system, condition of transmission, etc. - and thats the same whether you speak the language or not. Also, prices are prices. cars are worth a certain amount, plus or minus local rate, and thats that. you should pretty much know what particular cars are worth before you go shopping. i wouldnt spend more than $2000 for an (old) car, or up to $4000 in countries where theyre particularly expensive, and pretty much thats it. frankly you do well spending under $1000, and tinkering it into shape for a couple hundred dollars more. . and your comments about driving in romania being no fun, well, thats exactly the reverse, isnt it? depends on your point of view! theres nothing more fun than cruising along at 120 kph, and crashing into a huge hole in the road! may do a bit of damage to your car (and you!) - - but hey, thats why you wanted to wander around the balkans  right?!? dont feel too bad about it, im sure, as michael points out, that theyll put up a roadside shrine for you. . Finally, the comments about insurance are to the point. it is MUCH cheaper to get your green card in the east, rather than in a proper country like Germany. and that cheaper green card IS valid everywhere, just like its more expensive western version. Of course, if you actually get into an accident..(!) . Also, when youre back in Western Europe with an Eastern registered car, you never have to pay parking tickets. I had my old Bulgarian registered VW in Paris for a year, the poor ticket writers couldnt even identify the country-of-registration, they put a question mark on the tickets! i never paid a single one! sure beats new york city! by[former member]|12 Jun 2006 13:06 | New York, NY,United States| | Report spam one final thought, we should dedicate this thread to harold doornbos, radio reporter from Holland, who in the 8 years or so of the yugoslav wars of secession, went through 22 or 24 cars. literally. seriously. . these included an armored mercedes once used by german businessmen, stolen in front of the hotel moskva in belgrade, a VW Golf that he left in front of his flat in budapest for, over a year, it slowly disintegrated one piece at a time, a citroen BX that i inherited after my Jetta was stolen, and was eventually impounded by the French, and dozens more . he holds the record for most cars consumed by a war correspondent! by[former member]|12 Jun 2006 14:06 | New York, NY,United States| | Report spam alan, mr doornbus should have bought a lada niva! i saw a nearly new,armour plated,long wheel base diesel for sale yesterday for 6000 euros.police blue! by Michael Bowring |12 Jun 2006 14:06 | Belgrade,Serbia| | Report spam yes, people either love or hate Nivas. i happen to love them. i think harold had one or two at various times. gas guzzlers, but that 4-wheel drive on a relatively light chasis take you through snow that a land rover or land cruiser cant handle. i borrowed one to tool around mostar and its environs back in 96 for an assignment, it was great. polish license plates on that one. of course the gear-shift knob popped off as i took a tight corner, and even on a proper highway the fastest it would go was around 110 or 115, but thats OK. a definite plus during mud season. not the best car for long-haul trans-continental voyages, due to slow speed and high gas consumption. but perfect for balkan local work. . sadly the era of communist cars is ending. theyre all getting so old and most countries wont even let you register and drive them any more because of emissions standards. but just think for a momentthere was a time when a poor east german worker would wait three or four years for a Trabantthis brave new europe may be more peaceful, efficient, and comfortable, but its dominated by the golden arches of McDonalds rather than the hammers and sickles of proletarian unity. by[former member]|12 Jun 2006 16:06 | New York, NY,United States| | Report spam Hey Alan, getting ripped off happens, even if you speak the language. What are you talking about are the real obvious things to look after, buying a cheap car. If you spend more and think, â€œnow the rest of my trip I dont have to worryâ€œ you should buy rather new ( ha ha ha). Just an example: A lot of used cars sold in Berlin are total trash, wrecks which had be redone in Poland for small money. The only problem, a car redone to look perfect will not withstand the same impact as the car was designed for. A lot of airbags wont work. These cars are totally insecure. But you really have to look hard to find traces of the former accident. They guys doing this are geniouses. Anyway: Sure is driving in Romania fun, actually a hell of fun, as long as you return in perfect shape and healthy And the ticket thing is so cool. I drive a car with German licence plates in Spain and it even works here. God bless the European Community. by Heinrich Voelkel |12 Jun 2006 18:06 | Barcelona,Spain| | Report spam heinrich, airbags?!?!!! . we are talking apples and oranges!!! the old cars that ive driven (and, yes, been stuck with, broken down) were all too old to have airbags. you are totally right regarding that level of carcars being made to look better than they actually are . i am talking really of cars old enough (10-15 years old, or older) where no one would take the trouble to defraud you, because you are paying a really cheap price. no one is going to try and cheat you on a $800 1985 Opel, for example. its just too old to be worth cheating you over. And you know what youre getting. You know that its going to need work, and regular love and careand you know that one $800 car can be better than anotherif you choose it correctly. . old cars are a bit like old cameras. they are more demanding, require a bit more skill. no automatic transmission, usually. no power steering or power windows or anti-lock brakes, no power adjustable seats, no CD player in the radio, no fuel injection, probably, and definitely no airbags. are you better off with a new car, a 2006 SAAB , for instance? of course you are, if you have the money. but if you just want to get by with something old, cheap, relatively reliable, then i do think it makes sense to get a 1988 VW Golf, or Jetta, for example. Plenty of them were used and not so abused in Western Europe, and theyre simple enough cars that mechanics all across Europe can work on them, and those VW engines were made very well indeed. lots of power with decent fuel economy. and the VW suspension is great - really built for speed and cornering - in a consumer-level car. . and yes, of course, drive carefully and get home safe! theres no alternative for good road skills, developing good instincts. much better to photograph those roadside shrines rather than having one built for you! by[former member]|12 Jun 2006 18:06 | New York, NY,United States| | Report spam Alan, I have been driving an ( by now) 17 year old BMW 316i with an airbag. I bought it for 2000 German Mark/ 1000 â‚¬ and it served me well. Now I drive an 6 year old Opel Kombi/ Stationwagon ( with Airbags) and this is a really shitty car. It was more expensive then every car I ever bought, but I had no choice. I have to haul around two kids and their friends as well. And even on this expensive car they cheated on me. The VW is maybe a good choice, but there wont be really cheap either. Too many people look for this kind of bargain. Anyway. Davin will find a car, drive it and maybe we will even see a picture of this godness of the dark roads.

On paper, youre buying a car and selling it before you leave but theyve made it almost as trouble free as renting a car, but a bit cheaper. Minimum rental period is 17 days.
