His other credits include playing the wise-cracking best man Skobo in ABC's series Big Day , and playing opposite Heather Locklear in See Jayne Run . His film credits include Imagine That with Eddie Murphy and Mall Cop with Kevin James. And when he isn't doing his acting thing, he's keeping audiences laughing with his stand-up routine at clubs across the country, as well as on Comedy Central.
