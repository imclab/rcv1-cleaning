He is consistently in the 95%+ for length. We are ready to move him into a convertible seat. My friends have recommended the Marathon. Are there any other seats I should consider for him? Ideally, I want something that will grow with him for awhile, but also can be easily used on a plane (we travel about 5 times a year). If it matters, we have a 2008 Honda CR-V.

Well when I hear travel often I either think of purchasing something like the Avenue which RFs to 35lbs then FFs to 40lbs, it is very light and fairly in-expensive at under $100. The shell is not extremly tall but it makes for a great traveling seat so you do not have to lug around a bigger seat. I also think of the Sunshine Kids Radian (SKRs), they DO have a tall shell and also RFs to 35lbs then FFs to 65lbs or 80lbs depending on the model. My personal favorite is the SKR XT, it is a SKR with headwings, which is great for side-impact (SI) protection. The SKR seats all have very similar (if not the same) top harness slots, so it is doubtful that a child will make it to 80lbs in an XT or SKR80. The SKR seats can be very quirky to get a good install, and of course we recommend you taking any seat to a certified carseat tech. You however will have to be able to install the seat, so of course you want something that is easy for you to install as well. These retail for approx $220-someone correct me if I am wrong, I have got to look at the prices for these again as my mind is getting foggy with these recently With your son being tall for his age I would also look at the First Years True Fit. It has a tall shell and decent top harness slots, RFs to 35lbs then FFs to 65lbs. The harness adjuster can become burried in the vechicle seat back, but it looks like with the new Anti-Rebound Bar version they have solved this problem. I am not certain what the ARB seat is retailing for, but the plain version sells for around $180 in a variety of covers The Marathon does not have a very tall shell yet is most likely one of the easiet seats to install, always a plus! It can be teathered RFing, another plus and only the SK seats can do this as well. If you like the MA, have you looked at the new Graco MyRide? It is the FIRST seat to be sold in the U.S. that RFs to 40lbs instead of 35lbs. The shell heights and harness slots on the MR and the MA are very similar. It does appear to be a ghost seat which means some children have more room in one or the other even though they are very similar. The retail price on the MR is $150 Kuddos for keeping your babe RFing! __________________ Crystal, SAHM to J age 8yrs11months/49.25/55lbs/ Blue Opal Recaro ProBooster and Orange OSPKWY  mommaon112903 View Public Profile Find More Posts by mommaon112903 06-09-2009, 08:19 AM # 3 Maedze CPS Advocate Join Date: Sep 2008 Location: Invisible, but right behind you Posts: 9,820  Re: Convertible Car Seat Reco for Large Baby Welcome to C-S.org The most important thing to remember with a convertible is that children should stay rearfacing as long as possible. 3-4 years is now possible with the current seats on the market. The Marathon is a nice seat, user friendly, and has cute covers, but right now there are other seats on the market that will last longer. The First Years True Fit will get most kids to three plus rearfacing. The Graco MyRide, with a 40 lb rearfacing limit, will get most kids to around four rearfacing. Other seats to consider might be the Evenflo Triumph Advance, the Sunshine Kids' Radian, and the NEW Alpha Omega Elites. Try them, find out which one you feel is easiest for you to use correctly every single time, and fits your car and child well, and then schedule an appointment with a technician  Maedze View Public Profile Find More Posts by Maedze 06-09-2009, 09:08 AM # 4 DahliaRW CPS Fanatic Join Date: Apr 2009 Location: Near the Cascades! Posts: 1,665  Re: Convertible Car Seat Reco for Large Baby If he's 95% for height the MyRide most likely will not get him to 40lbs rfing. I'd go for a seat with a taller shell, like the true fit or radian, since he'll most likely outgrow seats by height before weight. __________________ Mommy to two wild little boys and a little princess!

We've used the SnugRide up to this point which is very easy to use on a plane and maneuver through an airport with the stroller frame. I'll miss that ease for sure!
