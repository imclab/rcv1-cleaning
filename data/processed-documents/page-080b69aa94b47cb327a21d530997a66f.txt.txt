Later that year, West's mother, Donda, died, and the superstar departed on a global concert tour, leaving the TV project behind. It was all a distant memory until this summer, when clips from the pilot started popping up  first on YouTube, and then at a comedy show in Brooklyn, where a bootleg copy of the entire episode was screened. read more Emmy Preview: Host Neil Patrick Harris Preps For the Big Night   Aug 27, 2013 07:00 AM ET (3) %=STwitterAcct % >  < % if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(STwitterAcct) ) { % > < %=STwitterAcct %> < % } % by Kate Hahn Neil Patrick Harris It's going to be legendary.
