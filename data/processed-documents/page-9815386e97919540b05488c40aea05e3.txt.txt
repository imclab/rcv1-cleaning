High Definition Television: Basically, the term "HD" refers to the quality of the broadcast signal that is sent to the television set. The high definition signal represents images that are as crystal clear and lifelike as possible. When you watch a program via HDTV, you will quickly understand why it is becoming the favorite method of watching TV! The HD signal is digital in nature and provides viewers a 16:9 wide screen format, the same as used in movie theaters. The incredible, lifelike images displayed through HD televisions are unbelievable! You can literally feel like you at the racetrack or on the football field! If you are watching a concert, you will have a front row seat. Be sure to do a little research to find the format that you will prefer, primarily LCD or Plasma.
