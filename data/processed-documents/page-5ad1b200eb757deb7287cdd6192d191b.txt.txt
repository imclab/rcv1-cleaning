What a life, what a legacy, and what a g-g-generation! To put my 5* rating in perspective: as a very young teen, I was indifferent about The Who, couldn't name more than 3 songs they performed, wasn't a fan of the on-stage performance art-ish antics, and thought Tommy was mildly entertaining thanks to Elton John and Tina Turner; I'd rather have been listening to my Hendrix or Zeppelin LPs. So, my interest in this book surprised me; it was purely from seeing this very recognizable man recently on TV, promoting his bio, and being struck by his level of sincerity and vulnerability -- an almost apologetic demeanor without any of the ususal celeb braggadocio and self-aggrandizement that ruined some of the music celeb bios I've tried to get through (because yeah, we know, you're a bad A$$). Could that possibly be that rock star that used to do that windmill thing, smash his guitar, and strut with the royals of British rock, long live sex drugs and rock and roll? I was not some former fan, hoping to read Townshend's bio and flash-back to the glorious days when *I'd walk over you to see The Who.* That perceived candor was accurate; I doubt it's possible to lay yourself so bare, as Townshend has done here, and be duplicitous. The history is fascinating and it reads like a grand timeline of rock and roll (which he calls *the absolute vehicle for self-destruction*). Townshend can probably go head to head with Keith Richards and his stories, but you don't get the sense that you are gathered around a pub table being regaled with wild rock star adventures -- though there are plenty of tales included. Instead, there is a kind of tolerance and wisdom that distances Townshend from being led by his talent to mastering his talent. His insecurities and self-doubts are bravely admitted, his love of family and friends obvious. I liked that he spoke about his achievements without bragging, aware of his talent as a gift--not a free pass to be an arse. Once in a while an author connects to the reader and invites them into his life, it becomes intimate and real, like a confessional, and that connection is a gift borne of talent. Townshend's writing, and choice to narrate the book himself, put this book in that category. If I'd paid attention to those lyrics years ago, I probably wouldn't have been so surprised by his depth and talent. Like the man, this book is the real thing, and the product of a life lived hard...and well. The best celeb bio I've read to date (including the great Steve Jobs bio)--and remember, this is a man I had no interest in before. I'll have to go back and listen to The Who (with my *mature* ears) to see if I am yet a fan of the music, but I can say without any doubt I sure like Pete Townshend the man.

Millions attended street parties to celebrate the Queen's 25th anniversary on the throne. Meanwhile, a more irreverent party had been planned. A boat laden with The Sex Pistols, their Svengali manager Malcolm McLaren, journalists, and various friends and hangers-on sailed by The Houses of Parliament while The Pistols blasted out Anarchy In The UK. Shortly after, the boat was boarded by police and "persuaded" to return to shore. http%3A%2F%2Fsamples.audible.com%2Fbk%2Fbbcw%2F007229%2Fbk_bbcw_007229_sample.mp3+flashcontent172PVG7Y4P28VMPKYVBH30 The People's Songs: Rehab UNABRIDGED Stuart Maconie The People's Songs: Rehab UNABRIDGED (44 mins) By Stuart Maconie Narrated By Stuart Maconie Overall (0) Performance (0) Story (0) Amy Winehouse is a tragic and extreme example of the price of fame in the UK in the Noughties. She was someone who'd been pursuing fame since childhood. She'd attended theatre schools, learned guitar, and sung with the National Jazz Youth Orchestra. Amy took much or her style from the '60s girl groups (the beehive) and from Ronnie Spector (the Cleopatra eye-liner). Amy's style was somehow already familiar but very fresh to a young audience. With frightening regularity she was on the tabloid's front-pages: Amy with a new tattoo...stumbling from a club...looking skeletal. http%3A%2F%2Fsamples.audible.com%2Fbk%2Fbbcw%2F007226%2Fbk_bbcw_007226_sample.mp3+flashcontent172PVG7Y4P28VMPKYVBH31 The People's Songs: Whiter Shade of Pale UNABRIDGED Stuart Maconie The People's Songs: Whiter Shade of Pale UNABRIDGED (46 mins) By Stuart Maconie Narrated By Stuart Maconie Overall (0) Performance (0) Story (0) This was Britain's first gentle whiff of drug culture in pop music. The sounds of what later became known as the Summer of Love, were first encapsulated on this side of the Atlantic by Procol Harum's hit. The concepts of free love, liberal politics, casual drug use, communal living, and opposition to the Vietnam War were at its core. Slowly the culture had infiltrated first the American West Coast music scene and then more popular culture. In London, everything was just groovy. Hair was worn a little longer, beads were sported, and flowers waved about. "A Whiter Shade of Pale" was the debut single from Procol Harum, which went to number one in the UK. http%3A%2F%2Fsamples.audible.com%2Fbk%2Fbbcw%2F007227%2Fbk_bbcw_007227_sample.mp3+flashcontent172PVG7Y4P28VMPKYVBH32 The People's Songs: My Boy Lollipop UNABRIDGED Stuart Maconie The People's Songs: My Boy Lollipop UNABRIDGED (47 mins) By Stuart Maconie Narrated By Stuart Maconie Overall (0) Performance (0) Story (0) Afro-Caribbean calypsos had taken root in the folk scene of the early '60s, but for many Britons their first experience of this new music came courtesy of an effervescent, feisty young woman from the Jamaican slums called Millie. "My Boy Lollipop" became the first hit single for Island records. Millie even appeared on a Beatles TV special in 1964. This was the start of a cross cultural pollination. http%3A%2F%2Fsamples.audible.com%2Fbk%2Frand%2F003326%2Fbk_rand_003326_sample.mp3+flashcontent172PVG7Y4P28VMPKYVBH33 In Spite of Myself ABRIDGED Christopher Plummer In Spite of Myself ABRIDGED (16 hrs and 38 mins) By Christopher Plummer Narrated By Christopher Plummer Overall (0) Performance (0) Story (0) He was born a Canadian on a Friday the 13th in 1929 - the year of the Crash. His boyhood was one of privilege: an ancestor was a Governor General; his great-grandfather Sir John Abbott was Canada’s third prime minister and owned railroads. There were steam yachts, mansions, and a life of Victorian gentility and somewhat cluttered splendor. Plummer tells how "this young bilingual wastrel, incurably romantic, spoiled rotten, tore himself away from the ski slopes to break into the big bad world of theatre, not from the streets up but from an Edwardian living room down".
