You get a list of books you have to read. This was by far my favorite. This might even be my favorite book ever. It is action-packed and doesn't get boring in any parts like some books do.

After reading the Hunger Games books, I was a little nervous about whether Divergent would be a copy-cat attempt at fame.

The story keeps you interested in the southern way of life in the early years of the depression in Alabama. I quickly felt myself in this small town atmosphere through the eyes of a young Jem. I grew up in a place like this, and was curious and scared of a man just like Boo Radley. The strength of Atticus for the community and fellow man begins an era that will see changes for those who were discriminated back in that day.

This book has a wonderful cadence and rythmn that can be tapped on the board book when read to the child. This is a great way to keep the childs attention while reading the book. It is also exciting when you see the child pick up the book and start tapping and reading (as best they can) the book. It also teachers children primary colors and is easily memorized for retelling. I recommend it to everyone with young children - and for gifts. see less ourjudy Oct 29,10 add to compare Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See Board compare Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See Board  Inside Out and Back Again (Reprint) (Paperback) quick info.
