  Drive-In Diners Motor into 21st Century As baby boomers, my husband and I have fond childhood memories of family road trips that included stops at drive-in diners that dotted the nations byways in the 50s and 60s. So we were delighted to discover Reds Root Beer during a recent vacation near Paw Paw, Mich. A by-product of the nations love affair with cars, drive-in diners surfaced in the 1920s, survived the Great Depression and thrived afterward because of their good cheap food and fun, writes artist Don Sawyer, who captures this slice of Americana on canvas, on dinerdon.com. The popularity of drive-in diners peaked in the 1930s and 40s, falling victim to the rise of fast-food giants in the 1960s and 70s. Like drive-in movie theaters, drive-in diners seemed to be headed down the road to extinction. However, the once-ubiquitous drive-in diner may be poised to pull a U-turn thanks to TV shows like the Food Networks Drive-ins, Diners and Dives and the Travel Channels Man v. Food, and chains like Sonic Drive-In, Rubys Diner and AW.

Now one automaker is lending a helping hand to an industry whose history is so intertwined with its own. Honda announced today that it has launched a national campaign to help revitalize drive-in movie theaters as they face the latest threat to their existence after decades of decline: the digital revolution. According to an April story from The Hollywood Reporter out of CinemaCon, the annual theater-owners convention in Las Vegas, Hollywood studios will cease distribution of 35 mm prints of films by the end of this year. That means theaters that have not yet made the pricey conversion to digital by that time — estimated to cost between $75,000 and $100,000 — will be without a product to exhibit. That’s particularly bad news for owners of drive-in theaters, who say their profit margins are far too slim for them to absorb such an expense, and that the end of two-reel celluloid prints will effectively put them out of business.

Dont get us wrong — we love a well-placed splash of color every once in a while, but most of us put the Barbies away years ago. Unfortunately, Chevrolet isnt the worst offender. I polled the staff and they came up with an impressive list of eye sores.

Automakers have predicted this for the better part of the past decade as car stereos augmented the standard CD player with auxiliary MP3 jacks, USB/iPod connectors and, eventually, streaming Bluetooth audio. As far back as late 2011, market researcher NPD Group said nearly a third of people listened to music in their cars via smartphones or MP3 players . And this year, J.D. Powers Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout Study found that as many people listen to CDs as external devices, like an iPod or a smartphone. In past APEAL studies, more drivers still listened to CDs. Its already happening, and not just in tech-heavy cars like the Tesla Model S. Opt for the 8.4-inch multimedia touch-screen in a 2013 Dodge Dart, and the CD player goes into the center armrest — a spot that underlines just how many drivers Dodge expects to use it. Up-level versions of the all-new 2014 Jeep Cherokee and redesigned Grand Cherokee, meanwhile, forego CD players entirely. You can still get one, but it goes in the center armrest or glove compartment. Chevrolets 7-inch MyLink touch-screen in the 2014 Sonic eliminates the CD player altogether. And in the 2014 Kia Soul and 2013 Chevrolet Spark, you cant buy a CD player in any trim. Are we just a few years away from CD players becoming extinct? And what are car designers doing with the free space?

Lexus ad director Jacob Rosenberg invited 212 users from across the country to make the first film using only Instagram photos. Armed with mobile devices, participants were given a movie frame number and snapped away at Lexuss 2014 IS F Sport . Once all 360 frames were taken, participants applied filters to their photo, but cropping wasnt allowed. Does the redesigned IS look even more aggressive draped in a bit of Hefe or Sutro filters? You decide. All frames were then uploaded using the #LexusInstafilm and assigned frame number hashtags. The Instagram pics were then compiled and sequenced to make the film. Check out the video.

If you read that question to the tune of a certain Nickelodeon childrens shows theme song, the answer is obvious: SpongeBob SquarePants! This past weekend, Toyota unveiled a one-of-a-kind 2014 Highlander concept created to sponge off the popularity of the wacky and wildly popular cartoon character. The worlds first SpongeBob SquarePants-inspired vehicle, which debuted last Saturday in San Diego during SpongeBob Day at the Padres versus San Francisco Giants baseball game, features exterior and interior designs customized in honor of the pants-wearing, pineapple-residing Porifera and his pals. The SpongeBob Highlander will tour the nation, making stops between July and December in Baltimore; Orlando, Fla.; Minneapolis; Chicago; Vail, Colo.; Oakland, Calif.; and Los Angeles. It ends its trek at the 2013 Los Angeles Auto Show, which runs from Nov. 22 to Dec. 1. The redesigned-for-2014 Highlander first bowed at the 2013 New York International Auto Show last spring.

The 33-year-old Muskego, Wis., resident fondly remembers family outings under the stars, catching a double feature (usually one good movie and one not so much), playing at the on-premises playground before showtime, eating dinner and relaxing in comfortable chairs theyd brought with them. It is an entire experience, he said. Unfortunately for alfresco film fans, the decades have not been kind to the drive-in industry; the number of outdoor theaters has dwindled to a tiny fraction of their former glory. Like a plot twist you can see coming a mile away, the drive-ins demise seems perpetually right around the corner.

Lets see here: February 2010, Windy City-area RealWheels Corp. unveils a special-edition Chicago Blackhawks Chevrolet Camaro ; June 2010, Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup. February 2013, RealWheels unveils a new special edition Blackhawks Camaro; June 2013, Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup again. Coincidence? If netting Chicago its second NHL championship victory in three years was the goal, adorning the two-tone red-and-black Camaro with logos, badging and other details seems to be working. Will the Hawked-out Camaro make an appearance at the victory parade in Chicago this Friday?

Actually, its not just any old Ram; its the Man of Steel Power Wagon. Chrysler teamed up with Warner Brothers to create the truck to promote the Man of Steel Superman movie opening in theaters this Friday. The Dark Ceramic Gray truck wears a high-gloss black roof and a red-accented grille and rides on satin-black forged-aluminum 17-inch off-road wheels. Supermans S shield is front and center on the grille, and Man of Steel badges are peppered inside and out. Oddly, the Power Wagon doesnt have a role in the film; rather, Chrysler said that several vintage Ram trucks make cameos. You can put your wallet away, however. The one-of-a-kind truck isnt for sale. Chrysler says itll be auctioned for charity. Check out the gallery below for more pictures.
