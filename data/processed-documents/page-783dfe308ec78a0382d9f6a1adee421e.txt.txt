The state of the auto enthusiast can be gauged yearly by two distinct events taking place between January and March at Cobo Center in Detroit -- the North American International Auto Show and the Detroit Autorama. While the former is a barometer of the world industry and what's to come, the latter measures car enthusiasm about what has been. This year we're proud to report that the state of the auto enthusiast, as judged by the 61st Detroit Autorama, is strong. The first good sign was traffic. Getting anywhere near Cobo Center took driving skills, a keen eye for parking and nerves of steel. By noon, most of the good spots were gone as the area was filled with people honking horns and revving engines. After that, we just needed to navigate the ticket lines. Jake Lingeman Not surprisingly, they moved very quickly. The 61st show was also the 50th year for the famous Ridler Award, a distinction given to the best car of the show. Vehicles can only win the Ridler if the Autorama is the entry's first public showing. For the celebration, more than half of the past 49 winners displayed their cars. Jake Lingeman This year the award went to Ron Cizek for his 1940 Ford coupe in a color called Checkered Past red. It was built at Cal Automotive Creations in Omaha, Neb., under the guidance of Andy Leach. Under the hood is a Ford Flathead with Offenhauser heads and a GMC 4-71 blower. Lingeman Ron Cizek's Ridler-winning 1940 Ford coupe But there's more to look at than the insanely kept customs at the Autorama. This year the show celebrated the cars of the Batman franchise . That includes the most-recent Tumbler, the original TV show car and our favorite, the 1989 classic from Tim Burton's movies. Along the walls of the main hall are booths dedicated to product demos, performance parts wholesalers and paint companies. There's also a section for automotive-related art, garage signs and custom metalwork and stickers. In the basement, physically and symbolically, are the rat rods. The event program lovingly terms them as traditional. For some, that's where the action really is. It's where personal beers are passed around, cars are started and the sound of metal shaving rings out. If the ratio upstairs of drivers to trailer queens is 25:75, down here it's the other way around. The basement is also where to find the pin stripers, greasers and rockabilly styled gentlemen. The Autorama is a show for enthusiasts of every budget. A boy and his dad could show up with a rusty bicycle they found and fixed up in a year, or with something insanely expensive and radical that took a decade to complete. It's all appreciated at Cobo Center and it's a good sign for generations of enthusiasts to come.
