Last month, the city sued the museum to collect $92,000 in taxes, plus interest and penalties, that it says were owed from July 2004 through June 2007. Dick Messer, Petersen’s executive director, said this week that, while the museum pays taxes on the parking income it gets by renting spaces on a monthly basis to non-visitors, it considers the $2 to $8 it collects from museum-goers who use the garage to be part of its regular operations, and therefore tax-exempt. “You’d think the city would want to encourage nonprofits to be self-sustaining and have streams of revenues to keep them open and going. Apparently not,” Messer said. The museum wanted to straighten out the issue years ago when it was first billed for parking taxes, Messer said, but the letters it sent evidently fell through a bureaucratic crack at City Hall and it never received a response. The J. Paul Getty Trust pays about $700,000 a year in parking taxes on its visitor garages at the Getty Center and the Getty Villa, a spokeswoman said, because we think its our legal obligation to do so. A spokeswoman for the Petersens across-the-street neighbor, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, said it contracts out its parking to a private operator, who pays the tax.

Except for the exterior, which totally should be redone to showcase whats inside, the museum and its collection is world class and exciting every time I go there. It should be one of the most popular places in LA for locals and tourists and not always suffering from finances. Its way more populist than MoCAs collection. Posted by:Eva Tarr | January 29, 2010 at 08:57 AM This is unfortunate for the musuem, which I imagine already has its share of financial difficulties. It has always been my favorite museum and never fails to WOW the friends/visitors I have brought there over the years.
