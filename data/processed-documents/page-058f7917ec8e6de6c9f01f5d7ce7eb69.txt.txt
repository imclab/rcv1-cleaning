Acura hasn’t revealed any details about the concept apart from this single sketch and the announcement that the vehicle’s unveiling will be a world premiere. We also know that the concept vehicle is destined for production, although so far the only market confirmed to receive it is the Chinese market. With Acura’s RDX being all-new for 2013, and the company only just taking the covers off its redesigned 2014 MDX , the concept most likely previews a potential new entry from the Japanese brand.   Given the size of the wheels in proportion to the body, the vehicle pictured in the sketch is likely to be a compact crossover, aimed at rivals such as the Audi Q3 and BMW X1 and the upcoming Lincoln MKC and Mercedes-Benz GLA Class .   Sister brand Honda will also be using the upcoming Shanghai show to present a new concept, in its case a new MPV. While a redesigned version of the North American-spec Honda Odyssey MPV was just unveiled at the recent 2013 New York Auto Show , the global version of the car has been on sale since 2008 and will be due for a redesign soon. It’s possible that the MPV concept we see in Shanghai will be a preview of that redesign. We’ll have more details soon, as the 2013 Shanghai Auto Show kicks off on Friday, April 19.
