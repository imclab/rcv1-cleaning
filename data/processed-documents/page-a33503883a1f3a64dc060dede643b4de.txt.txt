Meetings are held the 1st Tuesday of every month at 6:30pm; join us in the banquet room at Kep's Grill on Muller Road, Washington. Each meeting includes a short update on news and events, an artist's demonstration or presentation, a 'show and tell' time, and then wrap up with a little time to network. Practicing artists (novice and expert) are encouraged (but not required)to bring an item to share at 'show and tell'. Each month we have a theme that inspires some to create new work, but its always great to see anything community members are creating in the name of art!
