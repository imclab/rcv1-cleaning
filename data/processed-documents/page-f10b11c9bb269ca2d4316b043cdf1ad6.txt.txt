What isnt clichÃ© is the performance Black Sabbath delivered Monday night at a nearly sold out Shoreline Amphitheatre. For two hours, the iconic hard rock band  Read More Bacon Festival of America Set to Sizzle in San Jose Aug 26, 2013 by Stephen Layton Before Ryan Sebastian, co-owner of Moveable Feast and Treatbot, decided to create San Jose Bacon Festival of America, a large-scale food truck event themed entirely around bacon, he was leaning toward doing a sriracha festival, since everyone around here, he figured, had tried sriracha at some point, thus making it an instantly  Read More Photos: Inaugural Japan Expo at Santa Clara Convention Center Aug 26, 2013 by Stephen Layton Japan Expo made its first impact into the Santa Clara Convention Center this weekend with all things Japanese art and entertainment.

Read More Movies The World's End Aug 21, 2013 - by Richard Von Busack There's a shortage of good films about beerâthe list ought to include Saddest Music in the World, The Quiet Man, Strange Brew and the "Beer Bad" episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Now there's The World's End, a maniacal apocalyptic comedy. It's the tale of a diabolical pub crawl that changes the destiny of the human race. A group of former pals, grown paunchy, boring, suit-clad and Bluetooth-bearing, are rounded up by their erstwhile "king,"  Read More Jobs Aug 14, 2013 - by Richard Von Busack It's often conventional, marred by a tidy ending, but Jobs deserves defenders. Locally shot at Steve Jobs' childhood home, the $8.5 million biopic failed to set the night on fire when it closed Sundance. News of an Aaron ( The Social Network ) Sorkin-written biopic, in development now, meant that some were referring to Jobs as a beta version of the story even before it was released. According to Jobs' director Joshua Michael Stern, Steve Wozniak has already signed on as a consultant on Sorkin's untitled adaptation of Walter Issacson's book on the Apple co-founder.  Read More The Act of Killing Aug 8, 2013 - by Richard Von Busack The death by garrote of Luca Brasi, acted out by the corpulent Lenny Montana in The Godfather, isn't something you forget fast. The thought that someone made a way of life out of this kind of killing, that he killed a thousand men in this wayâis the most stomach-churning part of the documentary The Act of Killing by Joshua Oppenheimer.  Read More The Arts 'Shifting Sands' at the Cantor Arts Center Aug 21, 2013 - by Michael S. Gant Thanks to rising sea levels and elevated temperatures, soon most of us will be living on the littoral or in the trackless wasteland. Such a dire prospect adds a bit of future frisson to the past visions of "Shifting Sands: The Beach and the Desert in 20th-Century Photographs." This small but carefully sifted exhibition at Stanford's Cantor Arts Center reveals both the beauty and the anxiety evoked by crowded shores and desolate dune  Read More Sammy Obeid Aug 14, 2013 - by Jennifer Wadsworth Howard Stern told Sammy Obeid he picked the right career path in standup comedy. Louis C.K. complimented him on a jokeâthen ignored him. Dave Chappelle was the first famous guy to pronounce his name right (say it with me: "obeyed"). Some haven't been as receptive or ambivalent. A random guy at an Irish bar punched him in the stomach last summer. And some other dude told him he was the least funny comedian he'd ever had the displeasure of hearing.
