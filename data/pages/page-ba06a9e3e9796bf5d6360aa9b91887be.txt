We cannot attribute any purity of political expression to popular culture,
although we can locate its power to identify ideas and desires that are
relatively opposed, alongside those that are clearly complicit, to the
official culture.<P>
-- Andrew Ross, <i>No Respect: Intellectuals and Popular Culture</i>
<P>
We weren't philosophers, we were perverts.
<P>--Howard Stern, <i>Private Parts</i>

Popular culture has been defined as everything from "common culture," to
"folk culture," to "mass culture."  While it has been all of these things
at various points in history, in Post-War America, popular culture is
undeniably associated with commercial culture and all its trappings:
movies, television, radio, cyberspace, advertising, toys, nearly any
commodity available for purchase, many forms of art, photography, games,
and even group "experiences" like collective comet-watching or rave
dancing on ecstasy.  While humanities and social science departments
before the 1950s would rarely have imagined including anything from the
previous list in their curricula, it is now widely acknowledged that
popular culture can and must be analyzed as an important part of US
material, economic and political culture.  "Pop culture" is also one of
the US' most lucrative export commodities, making everything from Levi's
jeans to Sylvester Stallone movies popular on the international market.
<P>
It would be impossible to do an exhaustive (or even a not-so-exhaustive)
survey of all the work being done in and on popular culture, so we have
included only representative examples of both.  Our bibliographies and
links focus on major figures in popular writing and basic categories of
popular media after the war.
