		"<span class='description'>The dealer told me that my oil changes were every 5000 miles when I bought the car and to bring it back to them to get it changed when it was do. However I read about Car-doc on a forum I frequent so I decided to take it into them when it was time. Not only did Car-doc inform me that the correct service interval was ever 10k miles, not 5k, they also did a once over of my car, noted some areas of concern (nothing to serious), and printed off a copy of the manufacturers recommended maintenance schedule for me. All for no charge. They now have my complete trust, and I have been going back to them for 110,000 miles now. I recommend them to anyone looking for a mechanic.</span>"

		"<span class='description'>Excellent service. Dobbs told me that my front ball joints were bad.  Dobbs gave me a $700 estimate for ball joints and alignment.  I was shopping around for other estimates and heard about Car-Doc from a co-worker.  I took it in for an estimate, and they said, &quot;let&#039;s see if they are really bad first&quot;.  They called me and let me know that everything was fine, and I didn&#039;t need ball joints or an alignment... They saved me a lot of money.  They could have told me I needed the work and I would have paid to have it done.  I respect their honesty, and they have earned a customer for life!  They also replaced the linkage in my wipers - and at a great price.  They knew right away what was wrong when I explained it.  They ask a lot of questions and spend time getting detailed information from you.  So much different than these other places in town that want to get you in and out as fast as possible and up-sell a bunch of services that you don&#039;t need.  Try them, you won&#039;t be disappointed!</span>"
