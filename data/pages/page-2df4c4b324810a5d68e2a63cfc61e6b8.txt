<p>A Note from Nancy Gross of The Ojai Bubble.</p>

<p>     The Ojai Bubble July 2010 issue is at Ojai Printing and will be out and around in a few days. The issue is themed around French Connections to Ojai, in light of Bastille Day on July 14, and the French Festival in Santa Barbara on July 17 and 18. To view a small sampling of what is within, visit The Ojai Bubbleâs Facebook page. <br />
     With 28 pages of articles, photographs and poems, it is not only thicker than Volume 1; it is more consistent visually, while still playful and colorful. Perhaps Steve Grumette enhancing my photos, and having three professional photographers contribute are the reasons the pages look so pretty. And, as I received a suggestion here, a suggestion there, from Anca Colbert, my daughter Ivy Anderson, P. Lyn Middleton, Myrna Cambianica, and others, I grew in the graphics role. </p>

He and tenor Mark Llewellyn were performing lilting ballads that floated on the evening air. The audience knew they were in the presence of two uncommonly talented and unique musicians when Zeretzke began to make weird, unearthly sound effects to accompany the old whaling song they sang, the sounds of breaching whales. This he accomplished on an electronic violin and a handmade set of rare Bulgarian bagpipes.</p>

<p>The 64th Ojai Music Festival, slated for June 10 to 13, is seeking housing hosts for behind-the-scene production/technical staff and college music student interns.  The Festival is in need of guest cottages, private rooms, and homes in the Ojai Valley. </p>

<p>âItâs been a tradition since the late 1940s for Ojai Valley residents to extend their hospitality by inviting artists and production staff to stay at private homes or guest houses during the Festival weekend,â explains Festival operations director Gillian McManus. âThese opportunities have allowed artists to intimately experience the magic of Ojai, and it is a lifetime chance for residents to meet talented individuals in the classical music industry.â </p>

<p>The Noisy Donut Shop presents a special screening of Maynard James Keenan's (Tool, Puscifer, A Perfect Circle) new documentary film which follows his unusual adventure starting his own vineyard in an Arizona ghost town.<br />
 <br />
As the Los Angeles Times states, "The frisson between his [Keenan] well-crafted personal mystique and the way the film presents him as a dedicated new winemaker learning his craft is intriguing."<br />
 <br />
The film excited local artist and wine lover Attasalina Dews, so she and Christopher the Minister have teamed up with the Ojai Playhouse and the Village Jester to bring you this unique event. An after party will be held at the JESTER featuring wine from the ARIZONA STRONGHOLD...</p>

<p>CHUPACABRA</p>

<p>The Trickster. The Shape Shifter. The ever elusive shadow who mutates with the Sun and Moon. One year a Dragon, another a Snake. This is our mystery blend. Think forest, not trees. Think weather, not rain. Stare, and the CHUPACABRA, who dwells in your heart and not in your head, will vanish. Only a True Alchemist can draw holy blood from a stone, and the CHUPACABRA is his opus, his phoenix, his cherub, his child. Bravo, Mr. Glomski, Bravo!</p>

<p>On May 15th in Libbey Bowl, Iâm going to marry Deb Norton, the coolest, smartest, most talented person Iâve ever met. There might be 500 to 1000 people witnessing the ceremony. Why? Because Iâm ego-maniacal braggart? Hardly. As youâll see in the musical, that is the ceremony, the last thing I wanted was to be married, much less involved in some culturally mandated, pair-bonding ritual.  Was it because Debâs dad has a shotgun to my back? Nope. Well, I hope he doesnâtâ¦</p>

<p>Have you ever been to a concert and just end up smiling the entire time because the music is positive, fun, and creative? A performance where the energy is just right, the lyrics are inspirational, and the performer is happy to be alive and share? <strong><a href="http://www.joereilly.org/">Joe Reilly</a></strong> is that performer and he'll be in Ojai on <strong>Tuesday</strong> performing in the <a href="http://www.soulcentered.com/">Soul Centered</a> dome at 7pm. Tickets at the door.</p>

<blockquote>Joe Reilly's heart is an infinite ocean and each song that he writes is a resonant wave. We call him Spiritboy because when he aligns his hands, his heart, and his harmonies, he not only displays his personal emotional journey, he also plucks the heartstrings of hope to bring us beyond despair into healing action. His heart has been nurtured by Native American, Buddhist, and Catholic teachings. As a result, he can howl a chilling splash-in-the face blues about treachery and historical injustice and inspire you with upbeat ditties that echo in your mind long afterwards.</blockquote>

<p>Joe is from Michigan and this will be his second pass through Ojai. In the years I've known Joe,  I've discovered that he is gentle, kind, loving, musical, creative, and fun. His music his perfect for kids of all ages and most who leave wanting more. </p>

<p>In Ojai, California, an outdoor landmark of world-renown will be razed to the ground on June 21, 2010 and reconstruction will begin immediately thereafter. Beginning in 1957, Ojaiâs Libbey Bowl amphitheater has gathered international music and theatre groups attracting audiences from southern to northern California, and from east coast to west coast. As a tribute to the past, present and future of Ojaiâs Libbey Bowl, the Ojai Valley Museum will mount an historical exhibition showcasing the highlights of the Bowlâs first 50 years, and the plans for its reconstruction and future use. </p>

<p>The story of the development of life on Earth is not just a theory for biology books. It is the key to understanding our world today â not only our environment, but the moral and spiritual dimensions of our world as well.</p>

<p>This is the theme of âDeep Time and the Meaning of Lifeâ, a talk to be given by David E. Moody, Ph.D. Dr. Moodyâs talk explores the intersection between science and the sacred. It examines the extraordinary mystery of why our planet is so perfectly suited for life, with just the right climate and chemistry for us and all living things. Did this happen because God made it this way? Or are we just lucky? Or is there a deeper, more interesting explanation?</p>

<p>The Ojaiâ Libbey Bowlâs imminent renovation is the source of big excitement for a little town. The excitement grows with plans underway for the exhibit, âOjaiâs Libbey Bowl/Past, Present, Future,â opening April 29 at the Ojai Valley Museum, 130 W. Ojai Ave. The exhibit, like the Bowl project, is a joint community project, and will spotlight people and events that have been part of the amphitheaterâs long history. It is a joint venture between the Museum and the Save Libbey Bowl committee of the Ojai Valley Service Association.</p>

                              <p>The first year that Sweetie and I moved to Ojai we attended the Music Festival.  We had no idea what to expect, including the Libbey Bowl wooden benches imported from Spain after Torquemada had finished with them.</p>

<p>We sat close to the front, not wanting to miss a dulcet tone, a memorable phrase, a catchy tune.  Warmly placed between what turned out to be veteran Festival goers, we patiently waited for the program to begin.  A middle-aged man emerged to polite applause, plunked himself before the impressive Steinway and began to play.  Itâs been years since we experienced his performance and perhaps my memory is a bit clouded, but I swear he was playing with his elbows.</p>

<p>A Photography Exhibit at the Ojai Center for the Arts</p>

<p>EAT is the theme of this yearâs photograph exhibition at the Ojai Center for the Arts. The seventh annual juried show celebrating food and eating encourages any photographic style including photojournalism, agrarian landscapes, food stills, photomontages, etc. The show opens June 5 and runs through July 7, 2010. </p>

<p>Last year more than 40 works by nearly as many photographers were displayed at the Art Center.  This year we expect that more artists will compete to have one or more of their works in the show.</p>

<p>Photographers are invited to submit their work on June 3 or June 4.  Detailed submission information can be found on the <a href="http://www.bearwoodimages.com/photobranch">Photography Branch page </a>of the Art Center website.</p>

<p>Gallery hours are Tuesday through Sunday from 12 to 4 pm. Admission is free. There will be a reception Sunday, June 6 from 1 to 3:30 pm. Refreshments will be served. The Art Center is located in downtown Ojai at 113 South Montgomery Street.</p>

<p>I first met Betty at a yoga conference about twenty years. At the time, I was on an arduous journey trying to tie up a yoga book.  I had gone through three agents and my brave manuscript had met with untold rejections.When I found out that Betty started yoga later in life, (at around age fifty) I had this idea that she would make a great cover girl.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon, March 27th, at 4:30pm at the Ojai Theatre, the Ojai Valley Green Coalition will make a special presentation of the documentary film, <em>The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil</em>.</p>

<p>The film focuses on the oil supply crisis that the collapse of the Soviet Union brought upon Cuba. This Cuban experience of the 1990s offers lessons to help prepare other nations with petroleum-based economiesâsuch as our ownâfor a future in which oil will become more more expensive and could eventually be unavailable.</p>

<p>Speaking prior to the film screening will be Santa Barbara City Councilmember <a href="http://vote.daswilliams.org/">Das Williams</a>, who grew up in Ojai. He is a candidate for the California State Assembly and a community organizer for the Ventura-based nonprofit CAUSE, <br />

There are two theatre events this weekend that I'd like to recommend.  Two gay-themed plays being performed this weekend and I urge you to see them both.  The first to tell you of is<a href="http://www.108productions.org"> Corpus Christi </a>by Terrence McNally.  In the 1990's there were three notable plays by gay authors.  I had the good fortune of being in two of them. <a href="http://www.answers.com/paul-rudnick-writer-actor-comedy">Jeffrey</a> by Paul Rudnick and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=jTDcbJcCGTE">Angels in America</a> by Tony Kushner.  Jeffrey, an Off-Broadway sex romp and Angels, an 8-hour gay fantasia on national themes, both had long runs and critical acclaim.  Terrence McNally didn't fair as well. He got <a href="http://thefileroom.org/html/368.html">death threats</a> for the 1998 production of Corpus Christi.  More notable for the furor from the religious right than for it's artistic success, it opened to less than glowing reviews.  It has been revived over the years in various productions with better success than the original and comes to Ojai this weekend courtesy of Ojai's own John Grant and 108 Productions.  The troupe is on the last legs of a tour that began in 2008 and will end this Spring in San Francisco.  They're traveling with a documentary film crew, so it will be nice to have Ojai included in the mix.  </p>

<p>Speaking of Jeffrey, that is my connection to the actor in Theater 150's Solo Series presentation of <a href="http://www.broadwayworld.com/printcolumn.cfm?id=20605">Bent to the Flame.</a>  I met the playwright and actor Doug Tompos on Jeffrey.  He was assigned to teach me the roles I would be taking over.  Years later we worked catering in Los Angeles and I've not seen him for sometime until last Saturday's matinÃ©e.  Bent to the Flame tells us the story of a young Tennessee Williams, fresh on the heels of his success with A Glass Menagerie, as he is prepares to address an audience gathered to hear a lecture on the work of a controversial gay poet.  Doug gave a wonderful performance.  The only complaint I have about the production is that there were only 4 people in the audience!!  Let's hope that Ojai will come out and support the visiting artists this coming weekend.  </p>

<p>Corpus Christi is being presented at the Zalk Theatre of the Besant Hill School in Upper Ojai on March 26, 27, and 28.   Show times are 7:30pm.  Tickets are $25.00 @108productions.org or call 640-1210 or visit the Ojai Theatre Box Office at 146 E. Ojai Ave.</p>

<blockquote><h3>FREEDOM: 
<br><br><u>Quotation:</u> <em>"Every human has four endowments - self awareness, conscience, independent will, and creative imagination. These give us the ultimate human freedom... The power to choose, to respond, to change."</em> -Stephen Covey
<br><br><u>Affirmation:</u>
Freedom means that we have the independent will to act and respond creatively, that we have the self-awareness to self-reflect and to change as dictated by the compass of conscience. Moment by moment today, I become conscious of my freedom.
<br><br><u>Practice:</u> Claim your definition of freedom.  Write a haiku poem about freedom.</h3></blockquote>
<br><br><em>These affirmations are updated EVERY DAY at <a href="http://bit.ly/b5p5TQ">ojaipeace.org</a>.</em>

                              <p><strong>An Invitation from Marcia Benkert</strong></p>

<p>Although the notice is short, Iâm excited to share the news, and invite you to an important Public Art Dedication, in Ojai, California, Friday, February 12, 2010, at 4:00 p.m., 328 E. Ojai Avenue (fountain plaza behind Bonnie Luâs).</p>

<p>This majestic, steel sculpture of a Black Bear represents a memorial to our respected wildlife, and a reminder to ourselves, of the painful lessons that we, as a community, have needed to learn in order to effect a change in the way we respond to innocent animals wandering into our neighborhoods.</p>

                              <p>It's never a bad time to talk about music. Here's a group of songs (song, artist, release) that I've put together as a playlist for myself.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Road, Nick Cave &amp; Warren Ellis, The Road Original Film Score</li>
<li>Flume, Peter Gabriel, Scratch My Back</li>
<li>Summer Fog, The Album Leaf, A Chorus of Storytellers</li>
<li>Broken Horse, Freelance Whales, Weathervanes</li>

<p>You could probably find most of this on <a href="http://myspace.com">myspace</a>, <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a>, or <a href="http://mog.com">MOG</a> but I may also put together a recording to share. Look in the comments in the future.  For the record, Joe Henry, Four Tet, The Album Leaf, and Peter Gabriel are all playing in Los Angeles in the near future. </p>

<p>What are you listening to?</p>

                              <p>It should be an interesting meeting tonight!  This evening our City Council members will be deliberating on applicants for the vacancy created by the resignation of Joe DeVito last month. While appointing a fifth member to the council is a serious matter, I anticipate some humorous small town drama.</p>

<p>For those new to city meetings, they are held at Ojai City Hall, 401 S. Ventura Street. Meetings start at 7:30 p.m. This Item, "Appointment to City Council to Fill Unexpired Term," is number four on the agenda, so it <em>might</em> be after 8 p.m. before it comes up. I recommend arriving on time, if you can, so that you get your bearings, especially if you plan to speak at the podium for the candidate of your choice. </p>

<p>Delicious Pepperidge Farm cookies, coffee, assorted herbal teas and spring water are available in the city hall kitchen to add to the small-town friendliness of the meeting and to help keep you awake when things get bogged down. I have also been known to take home a handful of chocolate lady fingers to ease the pain of disappointment at the outcome -- or to celebrate small victories -- as the case may be.<br />
<strong>WARNING:</strong> <em>The coffee at city hall is real. This is not your low-caffeine-organic type brand. I drank it once and immediately felt a terrific jolt to my nervous system -- got the shakes and was up all night. </em></p>

<p><strong>Back to the matter at hand:</strong></p>

<p>As of this morning, five brave souls have applied for the position. In alphabetical order, the five candidates are: <br />
Paul Blatz, Demitri Corbin, Leonard Klaif, Mike Lenehan and John Mirk. </p>

<p>Our neighbor, Joan Rush, four other women and two menâ¦all grandparentsâ¦were exposing themselves to the community in a way that most of us only dream of.

<p>The Transition Town movement represents one of the most promising ways of engaging people and communities to take the far-reaching actions that are required to mitigate the effects of peak oil, climate change and the economic crisis. Here in Ojai I see the Transition Town model as a way to bring together and empower many different community projects, organizations and endeavors that are part of creating a sustainable community.</p>

<p>The first in a series of informative Transition Town meetings will be held on Tuesday, January 12, 7pm, at 1215 Drown Avenue, Ojai (above Grand, last house on left before intersection with Pleasant Ave).<br />

<p>This video is a peek into the life of Patrick Henry Hughes, who was born with an extremely rare genetic disorder: arms that could not straighten, legs that would never be able to walk, and most devastating of all, permanent blindness. He had been born with no eyes -- the eyes he has are artificial. It shows him as a baby, and later as a toddler, playing the piano.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xwCG0Ey2Mg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xwCG0Ey2Mg</a><br />

<p>What was the original name of the Ojai Playhouse in 1914 when it first opened?   How were prisoners in the Ojai jail kept in line without a guard ever being posted?  Where can you find the largest collection of fountains in the valley?   If questions like this intrigue you and you enjoy history, you may be interested in working with the Ojai Valley Museum docents, a group of volunteers that are the glue holding the daily museum operations together.  </p>

                              <p>I am a latecomer to the world of Wii, my appetite for video games dying with Atari's passing many years ago. For some reason, if the game's champions and villains aren't primitive low-res insects, monsters, or spaceships, they have no appeal to me.</p>
<p>
So I was more than a little surprised when a box of Wii showed up at our door several weeks ago. Apparently, a neighbor had hooked my wife on Wii Fit. I set it up and she started Wii-ing like a teenager. It wasn't long before she convinced me to give it a try.</p>

<p>Please be advised that the following officers and directors of the Ojai Film Festival Corporation d/b/a Ojai-Ventura International Film Festival have resigned:</p>

<p>David Shor<br />
Rinaldo Brutoco<br />
James Holland<br />
Sheila Cluff<br />
Bill Monot<br />
Lori Wyatt<br />
John Bennet Perry</p>

<p><em>Moments ago, David Shor, former Board Chairman and President of the festival, released the following statement:</em></p>

<p>I am proud of where I was able to take the festival as its board chairman and president, essentially leading it from its demise a few years ago to the position of acclaim it achieved this year. Over the course of the last three years a new strategic plan was developed and executed to expand the festival and attract wider audiences and serve a broader geographic area within Ventura County. As a result the festival expanded into Ventura, formed strategic partnerships with the Ojai Valley Inn & Spa and Brooks Institute, began the Celebrity Golf Classic, changed its name to the Ojai-Ventura International Film Festival, and for the first time attracted very capable and committed directors & officers from outside of Ojai. Additionally, many new donors, sponsors & advertisers signed-on with the festival and enabled the expansion into new venues, expanded special events and screenings, and the festival attracted the best films in its history. A relationship with the British Academy of Film & Television Arts (BAFTA) was formed along with many other special and meaningful relationships. <em>(continued after the jump)</em></p>

                              <p>From an online article published today, entitled "<a href="http://uuworld.org/news/articles/153582.shtml">Chalica, new weeklong UU holiday, slowly gains adherents - slowly</a>":<br />
<blockquote>Part of the reason that Chalica has the following that it does is that it has a song. Two songs actually. Evan Austin, a member of the UU Church of Ventura, Calif., wrote âThe Chalica Song,â several years ago, using the same tune as the âHanukkah Songâ sung by comedian-actor Adam Sandler. Austinâs song, molded in part around names of famous UUs, found its way onto YouTube where it has been viewed more than 1,300 times. <strong>[Posted here is the updated, second version]</strong></p>

<p>Austin said, âI just liked the idea of Chalica as a fresh new thing.â Could there be a copyright issue in emulating Sandlerâs song? âItâs just four guitar chords repeated over and over,â he noted.</blockquote></p>

Specifically, the "<a href="http://onecityventura.org/">One City</a>" Thanksgiving meal and celebration now in its second year in nearby Ventura. This all-volunteer event is hosted by a collective of faith, business, non-proï¬t 
and government organizations all working together for a better Ventura, and is "to include representatives from all of Ventura, friendly faces both young and old, rich and poor, tall and short, east and west, here and there" said VSSTF member Jack Broms, M.D.  <strong>A restaurant that was to cook most of the turkey backed out for reasons unknown, and the event is now scrambling to enlist Volunteer Chefs to prepare a few key dishes!  Distributed instructions are as follows:</strong>

<blockquote>1. Select a tray(s) to prepare: mashed potatoes, dressing, green beans, or turkey.

<p>2. Purchase food item(s) and large foil baking tray or pick up a tray at no cost from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=500+high+point+drive,+ventura,+ca&sll=34.291391,-119.197053&sspn=0.0245,0.037251&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=500+High+Point+Dr,+Ventura,+California+93003&z=16&iwloc=r0">Ventura Missionary Church</a>.  Turkeys will also be available at no cost beginning 11/19 at Ventura Missionary.  One tray should yield approximately 40 servings.</p>

<p>3. Prepare the dish* at home and place in full size foil baking tray.</p>

<p>4. Cover.  Label.  Refrigerate.</p>

<p>5. Deliver to rear entrance of the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=knights+of+columbus,+ventura&sll=34.290405,-119.197949&sspn=0.01225,0.018625&g=500+high+point+drive,+ventura,+ca&ie=UTF8&hq=knights+of+columbus,&hnear=Ventura,+CA&ll=34.280606,-119.297361&spn=0.011808,0.018625&z=16&iwloc=A">Knights of Columbus Hall at 36 Figueroa</a>, downtown Ventura at 8:45am Thanksgiving morning.</p>

                              <p>Wow, what a night at the Ojai Valley Inn! I just returned from the film festival's red carpet, where celebrities and filmmakers talked about their screenings. Demitri Corbin was there with camera in tow, so I expect we will see some great footage from him, too. Tomorrow is the last day of the fest, with 46 films being screened from 10:00 a.m to 8:00 p.m. Get out there!</p>

<p>ScienceDaily (Oct. 21, 2009) â Young men who voted for Republican John McCain or Libertarian candidate Robert Barr in the 2008 presidential election suffered an immediate drop in testosterone when the election results were announced, according to a study by researchers at Duke University and the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>In contrast, men who voted for the winner, Democrat Barack Obama, had stable testosterone levels immediately after the outcome.</p>

<p>Female study participants showed no significant change in their testosterone levels before and after the returns came in.</p>

                              <p>Each morning this week, when I step outside my door to go to to work, I see the silhouette of a bear in the pine tree across the street. From this distance, it looks just like the several-hundred-pound black bear that I first discovered in the same position, on the same branch, last Saturday morning. But it is not him. It is a 70-pound metal sculpture created by my neighbor, <a href="http://www.markbenkertsculpture.com/">Mark Benkert</a>, honoring the memory of the bear.

                              <p>An email from Susan Kapadia, former chef and owner of <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2008/10/dishing_ojai_world_flavor_cafe.shtml">World Flavor CafÃ©</a>, revealed that she sold her business to Stefano and Tammi Bernardi, who have served as long-time co-owners of Via Vai and Pane E Vino in Montecito. Stefano and Tammi have made some changes to the layout of the restaurant space to allow for a few more seats and created a fantastic rustic northern Italian menu (Stefano is from the region between Venice and Verona). Bill and I dined at Osteria Monte Grappa last night and were thrilled (ecstatic actually) to have another quality dining option in the Ojai Valley. Itâs also refreshing to see experienced restaurateurs at the helm. And, they brought one of their top chefs (Cesar) from Pane E Vino.</p>

<p>The menu is reasonably priced with countless offerings, including plenty of vegetarian options. The bambinos also have their own menu. We found the space to be a bit cramped and hot and the sloped floor an odd curiosity (our beverages were definitely tilting precariously in our neighborâs direction).</p>

<p>Until I watched this video, I only saw the Bear from far-away, hoping that staying away would help. It is so amazing and moving to see this beautiful willd Bear up close!   I am in awe.  Be sure to watch it!</p>

<p>Last weekend I overcame my adolescent shyness and reunited with my old classmates and teachers at the Nordhoff Centennial Celebration.</p>

<p>Those of you who were around when the high school was first established in 1909 will recall that our whole town was once called Nordhoff, and that is how the high school got its name.  But in 1916, a group called the anti-Nordhoffians, with the help of the manager of the Foothills Hotel, Mr. Morse, convinced a hopelessly divided town to convert from "Nordhoff" to the new name, "Ojai."</p>

<p>Videography is often an important introduction to major exhibitions at museums. Over a period of time, the Ojai Valley Museum had dreamed of making such an introduction available to its visitors for its exhibits. With an extremely limited budget, this boutique museum could not easily afford to employ professionals to do this very special creative endeavor for the museum.<br />

Rather than focusing on political events, the seven children featured in PROMISES offer a refreshing, human and sometimes humorous portrait of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</blockquote>

<p>Check this out thrill ride.... Filmed from a motorcycle going up Maricopa Highway, Route 33, from just before the Double Tunnels to just past the Rose Valley turn off, you will dodge Gravel Trucks coming out from behind blind curves...<br />
 <br />
During these ten minutes you will pass no less than 5 double hoppers, most of which are clearly and dangerously crossing over the double yellow lines.  That's one truck every 2 minutes!<br />
 <br />
The first three appear at about 1:50 (one minute, 50 seconds in).  The fourth appears around  blind curve at around 8:25.  The fifth also crosses over the double yellow line at around 9:50.</p>

<p>You can advance the player if you want or just watch the whole thing from the bottom of the mountain to the top.  We suggest you turn your volume way down low!<br />
 <br />
Also, you can blow up to a Full Screen view (pretty wild!) by hitting the Google View tab at the bottom right of the Flash Player.</p>

"Left home at the age of seven/one year later I'm carryin' an Ak-47." For hip hop artist Emmanuel Jal, a former child soldier in Sudan's brutal civil war, these lyrics are hardly empty posturing. They are the bitter reality of a young man who was "forced to sin" but determined to "never give up and never give in." Today, wounded but still hopeful, he fights a new battle: bringing peace to his beloved Sudan and building schools in Africa. This time, his weapon is a microphone. See why audiences from New York to Berlin to London rave about the award-winning film, War Child, and have embraced the hip-hop artist with a terrifying past and a gentle soul. Interspersing original interviews, live concerts, and rare footage of Jal as a seven year-old boy, War Child will make viewers cry, laugh, dance, and celebrate the power of hope.</p>

<p>Damage to our air quality is one of the reasons the Coalition has been opposed to gravel trucks traveling through the Ojai Valley on their way from the Cuyama valley to Oxnard and Ventura.  Ojai has what is known as a "closed" air shed, which means that pollutants collect here in the valley and remain trapped.  Despite appearances that might suggest otherwise, Ojai has some of the worst air quality in the County.</p>

<p><strong>Scientists have demonstrated that the link between diesel fume exposure and cancer lies in the ability of diesel exhaust to induce the growth of new blood vessels that serve as a food supply for solid tumors.</strong></p>

<p>In the mid-1970s The Bothy Band forever changed the face of Irish traditional music. One of the bandâs founding members, and one of its driving forces, was uilleann piper Paddy Keenan. The virtuosity and ferocity of his playing led to his being described as âthe Jimi Hendrix of the pipesâ, and his style has continued to mature in the intervening years as he has pursued a solo career. Generally acknowledged as the most accomplished uilleann piper performing today, he is certainly one of the most brilliant musicians of his generation.</p>

<p>The Ojai Big Band under the direction of Dan Willard, will present a free concert on Sunday, September 13 from 3 â 5 p.m., sponsored by the Ojai Presbyterian Church.  The Ojai Big Band currently rehearses at the church and plays for dances, weddings and other special events, but âthis concert will be more jazz and will allow the band to âstretch outâ and play arrangements that they normally do not have a chance to play,â says Dan Willard, director of the band.</p>

                              <p>It seems that yoga is very big now-a-days. Even Oprah is asking the big question: "What's the meaning of life?". She recently did a 10 week live, on-line seminar with New Age Guru Eckhart Tolle, discussing "the meaning of life". I thought I'd offer my version in this short music video.

<p><img src="http://www.ojaipost.com/images/3.png" width="118" height="178" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5: alt="3.png"/>The Ojai Valley Museum announced today that the âMad About Sergioâ reception is sold out. The response has been overwhelming and the museum must consider the comfort of our guests and the physical capacity of the facility. We will not be able to accommodate anyone who comes to the door without a prior official RSVP. Everyone with an official reservation will be admitted.</p>

<p>There will be two Sunday Gatherings with the cartoonist during the run of the exhibit. These will also be well attended so make your reservations early. For questions and information please contact the museum at (805) 640-1390 or see: <a href="http://www.ojaivalleymuseum.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ojaivalleymuseum.org/</a></p>

<p><strong>Anatomy of an Exhibit</strong></p>

<p>What occurs behind the scenes building an exhibit? Obviously there is talent, but in addition there is a lot of work and passion.  Take for instance the current Ojai Valley Museum exhibit, âMAD About Sergio.â The seed was planted when Bobbie Boschan, Vice President of the Museum Board of Trustees met Sergio AragonÃ©s two years ago at the former location of Artful Living. He was taking knitting lessons so he could knit a scarf for his wife for Valentineâs Day. The following year, when Boschan saw the cover of the program for the Ojai Film Festival, created by AragonÃ©s, the seed sprouted into the idea of an exhibit.</p>

It is a process that maybe only interesting to theater geeks and professionals but it is fascinating and I get great pleasure in knowing that some of theater's most gifted minds come here to Ojai to workshop their new creations and prepare them for the Great White Way.  Some great minds have assembled for the 12th season of the Ojai Playwright's Conference and last night I made a surprise visit on one of those old friends.</p>

Ojai, California, 1972. <br />
<em>Suza and her first yoga teacher, Sarah Kirton, who is described in</em> Yoga for People Over 50, <em>(1977). </em></p>

<p>The first thing my 90-year old student asked me while she was on the floor stretching her legs was, "Do you have a boyfriend?"  "Oh my God," I thought, "It just never ends. Romance will always be more interesting  than the rest of life."<br />
 <br />
I like to pry into the lives of my students as much as they like to pry into mine. After forty years of teaching, in every setting and  every sort of circumstance, I can safely say that <em>nothing</em> is as it seems.  In the course of a typical month I make the rounds all over the valley, from  picture-perfect estates in Rancho Matilija, the top of Foothill, Thacher, McAndrew and high up Sulphur Mountain Road in Upper Ojai, to more modest homes in the hills of Krotona, to humble apartments and small family houses on the valley floor, and even old "shacks" that are falling apart and going back to the Earth. </p>

<p>We were all born naked and how we look when we meet our maker is not especially relevant. And in between, most people like to be covered, especially in public.</p>

<p>But not everybody. Itâs summer, a time when even the prudish tend to doff their clothes, albeit in the privacy of their homes. Itâs when naked bodies become public that the trouble begins.</p>

<p>Another person wrote: "I have read many posts on here about not doing bending, twisting, etc and don't understand how yoga could be safe. Years ago before having osteo and other issues, I did yoga and I understand how it would not be safe now. Are there yoga classes that are tailored to osteo patients? how do you find them?"</p>

<blockquote>Teeming with vitality and intensity, Kubzansky's in-your-face staging bursts from both ends of the reconfigured 80-seat venue through a central runway flanked by the two audience rows. The solid ensemble performances is heightened by Randall Tico's atmospheric sound design.

<p>Theater 150's impressive first foray into full professional status shows there really are more "Hamlets" on heaven and earth than are dreamt of in even the most jaded philosphy.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>I felt like I was a friend of Otto Heino.  He was just that kind of person, who, if you met him a few times, you felt like  you knew him.  He was so greatly talented, but so friendly and natural too.  Otto lived and potted in the east end of Ojai, among the towering old oak trees, and near acres of orange orchards.  He had a gallery/store called The Pottery, in front of his home and studio, and it was open most afternoons, for anyone interested to wander through, either on the honor system, or with a friend helping out there.</blockquote>

<p>One is with 17-year-old singer/songwriter and Nordhoff High coed Jesse Lucas, who talks about her new demo CD and how she draws from personal experience (and sometimes dabbles in fiction) to create her signature acoustic-pop style.  Jesse plays her guitar and sings her newest song "Maybe" at the top of the show. <a href="http://radioojai.com/2009/07/17/lisa-interviews-singersongwriter-jesse-lucas.aspx">Listen here.</a> </p>

Would be fun to share some Otto memories or stories if anyone has them.  Here is the story in the Star.  <a href="http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/jul/17/otto-heino-ojai-artist-known-for-glaze-dies-at/">http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/jul/17/otto-heino-ojai-artist-known-for-glaze-dies-at/</a><strong><blockquote>âItâs the end of an era, really. Otto was truly one of the last great American craftsmen to live in our community,â said Donna Granata, founder of Focus on the Masters, a nonprofit educational organization that documents the lives and works of area artists.</p>

<p>âHe had a work ethic unmatched by anyone I know. This was a man who once produced a glaze to match a car,â Granata said of Heino, who was still using a pottery wheel and firing his own kilns into his 90s. âAll of his success, literally, he created with his two hands.â</blockquote></strong><br />

This is a film you don't want to miss, even if you don't eat eggs or have a hankering for feathered friends.  You will laugh out loud and even Sci-Fi and Twilight Zone fans will appreciate the style of the film.  </p>

<p>One thing's for sure, if you've been on the fence about getting chickens, you'll be convinced to join the growing ranks of home farmers who are committed to a more sustainable food system and to make happy hens a part of your life.</p>

<p>After the film we'll be having a chat with Garm Beall, founder of the website <a href="http://backyardchickens.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">backyardchickens.com</a> about how to get started raising chickens with Q&A at the Village Jester pub next door.</p>

<p>This is a fundraiser ($10) for the Food & Agriculture Committee of the Ojai Valley Green Coalition, so that we can plant more vegetable gardens for folks and conduct more culinary events.  So please broadcast this to others (Ojai and beyond) who love food and need a good laugh!</p>

<p><em>Meegan Huff Expected to Expand Existing and Forge New Community Partnerships as Visibility of Regional Festival Rises</em></p>

<p>OJAI, CALIF. (June 25, 2009) â Formerly the Ojai Film Festival, the Ojai-Ventura International Film Festival is proud to announce that Meegan Huff has been named the organizationâs new executive director as the Festival approaches its 10th anniversary this fall.  The behind-the-scenes leadership change comes on the heels of the Festivalâs recent announcement that it is broadening its regional footprint by becoming an event encompassing the cities of Ojai and Ventura.  </p>

<p>âWe are thrilled to have Meegan as a part of our team,â says David Shor, chairman of the Festival. âShe brings a strong creative energy to the teamânot to mention enormous professional experience in diverse industries that benefit the Festival. We are confident that Meegan will move our vision forward and will take us to the next step in our evolution as we enter our next chapter as a lifestyle-driven destination festival.â</p>

                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <p><em>Some of you may remember when Deepak Chopra came to Ojai a few years ago. First he spoke to a SRO crowd at the Krotona Institute where he eloquently reminded us of the perennial wisdom, the oneness of all life, and not to identify too much with the various roles we play in this world. For one fleeting moment I almost felt enlightened. I "got it" when he said, "Life is not only stranger than you think, it is stranger than you CAN think."</p>

<p>After the Krotona event, Deepak gave a talk to an intimate gathering at the Ojai Retreat. I got lucky and was invited to dinner with him and his wife at the Ranch House. The next day he did a booksigning at Local Hero before being whisked away to a series of events in Los Angeles where he spoke before an audience of several thousand. </p>

<p>I'm sure Deepak has his flaws like all human beings, but I am impressed by his astute observations on the human condition. I just finished reading his compassionate tribute to Michael Jackson on the Huffington Post, and felt moved to post it here.</em></p>

<p><strong>A Tribute to My Friend, Michael Jackson</strong></p>

<p>"Michael Jackson will be remembered, most likely, as a shattered icon, a pop genius who wound up a mutant of fame. That's not who I will remember, however. His mixture of mystery, isolation, indulgence, overwhelming global fame, and personal loneliness was intimately known to me. For twenty years I observed every aspect, and as easy as it was to love Michael -- and to want to protect him -- his sudden death yesterday seemed almost fated.</p>

<p><em>Press Release:</em></p>

<p>the biggest, little FILM festival youâve never heard about:  </p>

<p>10th ANNUAL OJAI-VENTURA INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL </p>

<p>NOV. 5 â 8, 2009</p>

<p>Newly-Expanded Film Festival Celebrates 10 Years of âEnriching the Human Spirit Through Filmâ with a Celebrity Golf Classic, World Premieres, Nonstop Indie and Classic Film Screenings and More</p>

<p>WHAT:                 The Ojai-Ventura International Film Festival celebrates two milestones this year: its 10th anniversary and joining forces with the City of Ventura to bring its selection of world class feature, short, animated and documentary films to an even broader audience. Known for its welcoming, familial spirit and dedication to showcasing compelling stories from budding and established filmmakers, the Festival is located just 70 miles from Hollywoodâs doorstep and has evolved into a top regional destination festival over the past ten years. Screened in locations throughout Ojai and Ventura, including the legendary Ojai Valley Inn & Spa, the Festivalâs past films include many that have subsequently received widespread distribution, honors and awards, including Academy Awards. Also, each year the Festival bestows Lifetime Achievement Awards on industry icons and a Limelight Award on the best film submitted by a student filmmaker. Past lifetime achievement honorees have included Ray Bradbury (Fahrenheit 451), Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon franchise, The Omen), Lauren Shuler Donner (St. Elmoâs Fire, Pretty in Pink, Dave) and Laszlo Kovacs (Ghostbusters).</p>

<p>Reflections on Ojai Music Festival 2009</p>

<p>Locally Grown concert celebrates summer solstice</p>

<p>As the summer outdoor concert season heats up, Locally Grown, a benefit concert in support of Food For Thought, the Ojai Healthy Schools program, will take place under the stars in Ojaiâs Libbey Park on Saturday, June 20th from 5 pm to 10 pm. Tickets range from $20 to $30 for lawn seats, $40 to $50 for reserved seats, to $150 for VIP seats (which includes admission to the after-show festivities) and are available online at <a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/57820" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.brownpapertickets.com</a>. âWeâre excited to be celebrating the summer solstice, since a big part of our mission is to reconnect people to the natural cycles of the earth by eating seasonal, locally grown produce, â according to Marty Fujita, President of Food For Thought.</p>

<p>The Ojai Art Center Photography Branch hung another standout show at the Art Center this weekend.  Thirty photographers qualified fifty photos in the Branch's annual show <em>Visions of Change</em>.  Well the only thing that didn't change was my winning nothing, nada, zilch.</p>

<p>From NPR's <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2009/05/the_beatbox_battle_world_champ.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All Songs Considered</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Who's the greatest beatboxer in the world? We'll soon find out, when the annual Beatbox Battle World Championship gets underway in Berlin, Germany on May 28. Each year contestants from all over the world flock to the city to lay down some sweet, human-generated beats in hopes of snagging the grand prize. This year's winner will be crowned on May 31.
<br><br>
In the meantime, the BBWC has announced the winner of its wildcard competition. It's Julia Dales, a 17 year-old from Canada.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Steve Reich, the 2008 featured composer at the Ojai Music Festival described by New Yorker magazine as âthe most original musical thinker of our time,â <strong>has won a Pulitzer Prize</strong> for Double Sextet, which was commissioned and premiered in 2007 by eighth blackbird, the music director of the 2009 Ojai Music Festival. The 22-minute work can be performed either by a sextet playing against a prerecording of the work or as an ensemble of 12 instrumentalists.<br><br>
On Sunday, June 14, the closing day of the four-day Ojai Music Festival, eighth blackbird will be joined by six âliveâ musicians in a performance of Steve Reichâs Double Sextet, to open the Festivalâs four-hour Marathon Finale.</blockquote>

<p>âNoises Off!â Opens</p>

<p>Leave it to an actor to write a play where the funniest action occurs backstage, but with equal hilarity onstage, coming to the Ojai Art Center Theater stage March 28 through April 25.</p>

<p>Itâs âNoises Off!â by Michael Frayn, who spawned this rowdy comedy while standing in the wings watching a farce starring Lynn Redgrave.</p>

<p>âIt was funnier from behind than in front and I thought that one day, I must write a farce from behind,â Frayn said.</p>

<p>âNoises Off!â is a play within a play, with the actors putting on a silly comedy entitled âNothing Onâ and blowing their lines, entrances and relationships.<br />

<p>âThis yearâs Locally Grown benefit concert will celebrate the diversity of our community, as well as continue our focus on environmental stewardshipâ announced Food For Thought president, Marty Fujita, today. âIt also takes place on Saturday, June 20th at summer solstice, which is significant to us, since a big part of Food For Thoughtâs mission is to reconnect people to the natural cycles of the earth by eating seasonal, locally grown produce.â The event will feature an eclectic mix of musical styles including American roots rock, Mexican-American rhythms, Reggae and Afro-Cuban beats.</p>

<p>Michael Shapiro, Chair of Stop the Trucks, sent the following letter regarding Weigh Tickets as a response to an email (below) from Chris Stephens, Director of Resource Managment for the County of Ventura.</p>

<p>Hello Chris -</p>

<p>I've finally read your email regarding how the Coalition might obtain a full year's worth of weigh tickets from the Ozena Ranch Mine facility.  Obviously -  the "evidence" you've collected is entirely insufficient.</p>

<p>I've turned your email over to our attorney -- for I do not have the legal skills to know how to go from here.   Naturally - I view your email not only with great disappointment - but I also see it as one more example of how the Planning Division does not wish to let genuine evidence come to light by conveniently hiding behind a rather poorly collected and insufficient randsom sample of Ozena weight tickets.   I'm not that naieve, Chris, to believe that if you and your other colleagues really wished to collect a full year's data that you would certainly be able to do so.    The fact that you aren't willing to do that speaks volumes:  You fear the TRUTH and simply can't handle the TRUTH.</p>

<p>We'll have to seek another legal remedy to get to the bottom of this.  How  unfortunate.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

Today is <a href="http://www.internationalwomensday.com/default.asp">International Womenâs Day</a>, which has been observed since 1911 (just 9 years later, women in the U.S. were given the right to vote).  This yearâs theme, as designated by the U.N. (individual countries also develop their own themes) is âWomen and men united to end violence against women and girls.â</p>

<p>A great way to honor and recognize women locally is to attend the <a href="http://www.womensexpovc.net/">Ventura County Womenâs EXPO</a>, taking place this weekend, March 13-15, at the Ventura County Fairgrounds.  Fifty dynamic guest speakers will present on various topics over the three-day event, including health, relationships, career, finances and motherhood.  The topic I am presenting is much less weighty and ambitious â <a href="http://www.womensexpovc.net/presenter.php#Fun">I will be talking about local wines</a>!</p>

                              <p>I was about to head down the hill to buy a cigar.  Itâs one of those forbidden pleasures I engage in a couple of times a year.  In order to curb my usage, I only buy one at a time.  That gives my guilt complex a chance to work on me before I actually lay out the cash.  Itâs an awful habit.  Mouth tastes like the inside of a shoe for two days.</p>

<p>So I said to Sweetie âYou know whatâ¦I think Iâll shlep down the hill to get a cigar.â  She said with a beautiful smile âGo ahead.  Youâll enjoy it.â    OK, I said, Iâll just check my e-mail.  Bad decision.</p>

<p>Catch gypsy/Balkan/jazz/flamenco group Fishtank Ensemble for the first time in Ojai as part of the Ojai Concert Series. The group, known for their wildly eclectic gypsy and Balkan flavored music, consists of one sexy diva and 5 crazy musicians, including a former peripatetic violinist who left his gypsy wagon in Europe after years of musical research and will break every hair on his bow to set the room on fire.<br />

                              <p>VENTURAâS FIRST EVER âYOGATHONâ TO SUPPORT KIDSâ ARTS</p>

<p>Today, Saturday, February 28, <a href="http://yogajones.com">Yoga Jones </a>and <a href="http://kidsartsventura.org">Kids' Arts </a>will host Ventura's first ever âYogathonâ fundraiser at the historical Elks Lodge, 11 S. Ash Street at Main, in Ventura.</p>

<p>Local teachers, including Ojai teachers Suza Francina at 2pm and Kira Ryder at 5pm, and others such as well-known Yogini and Indian dancer, Hemalayaa Behl, (4pm) will hold classes every hour from 9:00 am until 5:00 pm. The event will finish with an uplifting evening Kirtan, with the Ojai Kirtan Band at 7:00 pm.</p>

<p>A full day pass is $50 at the door or $15 per class, which includes free entry to the evening Ojai Kirtan Band event.</p>

<p>Arrive early to register and bring a mat and blanket. <br />
 <br />
Besides the yoga classes, the Yogathon features a silent auction, art exhibit, refreshments, massage and healing arts. </p>

<p>The event coordinators hope to raise awareness and funds to support continued free art and yoga classes for disadvantaged youth. One demonstration during the event will include a group of children asked to draw a picture and then participate in yoga, afterwards they will be asked to draw another image to illustrate the immediate difference yoga makes in a childâs perspective.<br />

Mardi Gras is coming! It's all happening this coming Saturday, February 21, starting at 7:30 at the Ojai Valley Woman's Club, 441 E. Ojai Ave. Tickets are $20 advance, $25 at the door. See press release or poster for ticket locations. This year's theme is "Venetian Vibrations: Unmask Your Passion!" Fittingly, artist Robert Lamarche's amazing masks are on sale now at Studio Sauvageau for those who need a stunning, last minute costume.</p>

<p>Live music, costume contest, Rondia's Southern homestyle cooking plus beer, wine, cocktails, fantastic decorations and slideshow! Don't miss the coronation of 2009 Mardi Gras King and Queen Scott and Betsy Smith of Euterpe Farms!</p>

<p>As always, this is a fundraiser and I have a special interest this year because my stepson, Denlow Enlow (my late wife Harmony's son), is the beneficiary of the proceeds. He is coping with the devastating effects and expenses of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.</p>

<p>Please help us get the word out to the community about this year's 19th annual benefit.<br />
Thanks,<br />

                              <p>Right here in our own backyard, we have two great wineries with tasting rooms open to the public: Casa Barranca and Old Creek Ranch (have you been?).  <a href="http://www.organic-wine.com/">Casa Barranca</a> specializes in organic wine, and <a href="http://www.oldcreekranch.com/">Old Creek</a> has some wonderful Mediterranean styles.  We also have <a href="http://www.movinowinebar.com/">Movino</a>, where Buddy Wilds serves up glasses of intriguing varieties, like Earthquake Zin or Caymus Conundrum, when heâs not up on the stage or coiffing a hair-do or two.  And over at the <a href="http://www.ojaibevco.com/">Ojai Beverage Co.</a>, Jorge and Joby have daily tastings to tempt any palate, and 1000 bottles to choose from.  Iâll be presenting on local wines <a href="http://vcreporter.com/cms/story/detail/ventura_county_s_grape_escape/6027/">(there are more than you'd think)</a> at the upcoming <a href="http://www.womensexpovc.net/">Ventura County Womenâs Expo</a> and would love to hear your thoughts about wine.  What have you tasted lately thatâs got you swooning over the grape?  And do you have any fun wine quotes (or even song lyrics) to share, like, âIn vino veritas (In wine there is truth),â or Dean Martinâs, âYou haven't drunk too much wine if you can still lie on the floor without holding on.â</p>

<p>"Goldaâs Balcony" offers the compelling story of Golda Meirâs transformation from a young Russian immigrant in Milwaukee to an activist for a Jewish state in Palestine and then to its leader â Prime Minister of Israel. </p>

<p>Framing her tale with the decisions she was forced to make during the 1973 war, she attempts to answer the question âWhat is the price for survival?â There were no easy answers for Golda, who sacrificed her relationships with her husband and children for her obligations to her country. Her uneasy conclusion was,  </p>

<p>       âPeace, there will be peace when the Arabs learn to love their children more than they hate the Jews". </p>

<p>Lindberg "was going through the stacks and said, "Hey, did you know this is Barack Obama?' " [Ojai's David] Bush said.</p>

<p>"It's truly one of those yard-sale finds," said Bush, an environmental lawyer.</p>

<p>The painter gave the portrait to Lindberg, who tried to donate it directly to Obama's national campaign, Bush said. But she never got a response to her queries. When Lindberg learned that Ojai was mounting its own campaign push, she stepped forward with the donation. As soon as McCluer saw it, she had to have it, her husband said. McCluer offered $2,000, but the campaign office organizers were unsure whether they should part with it. </blockquote><br />

The album is sort of bluegrass chamber music.  It's a fascinating listen.  I'm also enjoying the last Nickel Creek album "Why Should The Fire Die?," which I never got around to buying when it came out in 2005.  I picked up both albums this weekend on iTunes.</p>

<p>I've also been playing with the Pandora app on my iPhone.  You pick an artist you like, and it starts streaming songs you can give a thumbs up or thumbs down to, and as it learns your preferences, it builds out essentially a radio station.  I have a few channels set up, including ones based on Old Crow Medicine Show, Moby and Mother Hips.  It's very similar to SonicNet's app, which was available in the late '90's, but was killed due to licensing restrictions.</p>

<p><b>Goodbye Old Friend</b><br />
<img src="http://www.ojaipost.com/images/304.jpg"  hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" height="200" alt="Al Westcott Ojai"/>He was a friend of mine.  He was a friend of many.  It is with deep sadness that I inform you of the passing of Al Westcott last night, January 7, 2009.  Al has been a very close friend of mine since 1983.  Many of you met him at past Ojai Rock Fest shows.  He performed as "Maggie's Pa" as well as helping put on the production of many of these events.  Al died while doing what he loved best....playing music.  He was performing at a Retirement Home when he passed out and later died of a massive heart attack.  Al was the person who got me to come to Ojai almost 6 years ago by helping me land a great job.  He was the one who went with me to the doctor when I was first diagnosed with Cancer, and then went on to organize a benefit to help me pay the mound of expenses I was to incur.  He was a true friend.  Everyone who met Al always liked him.  He made people smile.  He had a great sense of humor, and was extremely charitable, even down to his dying minute.  It was a pleasure knowing you Al, you'll be greatly missed!<br />

I am pleased to pass on this announcement of <a href="http://www.ojaipoetryfestival.org/news/8.html">the first general meeting of the Ojai Valley Poetry Association</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Hello Poets and Festivilians,

<p>We were all shocked and dismayed (although not entirely surprised, considering the current economic climate) to hear that the festival committee had to cancel the intended program for the 2009 Ojai Poetry Festival.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a few of us optimistic souls met at the library and vowed to continue the good work of Festival co-founders Jim Lenfestey, Linda Silver, and Gael Belden--albeit in a new incarnation. To that end, John Kertis formed the Ojai Valley Poetry Association (OVPA), an unincorporated, non-profit entity under the auspices of the Ojai Valley Library Friends & Foundation, to oversee potential fundraising and organization of this year's festival. The current five-member board consists of myself, John Kertis, Liz Grumette, Dave Ray and Phil Taggart.</p>

<p>We're sending out a call to old and new friends of poetry to meet on Wednesday, January 21 at 7 p.m. at the Ojai Library to discuss the new agenda, new line-up possibilities and fund-raising potential. Volunteers are needed to design and manage all aspects of the Festival. All are welcome to the conversation.</p>

<p>Please pass the word.</p>

<p>Your Poetry Pal,<br />
Tree Bernstein</blockquote></p>

Grab another to ring in the new year, too!  I recently sipped champagne and chatted with Jobe Yoby and Jorge Alem of the <a href="http://ojaibevco.com/">Ojai Beverage Company</a>. Over a glass of bubbly, they talked with me about the difference between champagne and sparkling wine, how to open it, the glassware, the different styles, and how it's made.  <a href="http://radioojai.com/2008/12/19/lisa-at-the-ojai-beverage-company-the-champagne-show.aspx">Listen here.</a></p>

<p>In a case titled "Elizabeth Ann Vergilio Vs. County of Ventura," the owners of the Ozena gravel mine challenged the County's right to impose hours of operation and transit through the Ojai Valley.</p>

<p>Judge Reiser ruled against Virgilio and Ozena.  Even though Stop the Trucks was not a direct participant in this case, it is a huge victory for the Coalition.  Much of the County's brief was based on our research and complaints.</p>

<p><u>The "Stop the Trucks" Coalition has not only been supporting the County's contention that the rules must hold, we've also insisted that the County also actually enforce those rules.</u></p>

                              <p>Today is the last day of <b>Chalica</b>, a seven-day celebration of the principles that underlie the <a href="http://uua.org/">Unitarian Universalist</a> movement, beginning on the first Monday in December.  Like all holy-days, it was conceived by a person to meet a need; in this case is was a woman named Daylene Marshall from British Columbia, who a few years ago decided that a winter holiday to honor the UU principles would be a community-building and unifying thing.  Chalica continues to grow grassroots-style, with people discovering and creating it every year.  The general practice is to light a chalice (or candle) in one's home each day in honor of one principle, and to give gifts or take actions that further it.  Part of its beauty for me is that, just as one needn't be a Christian to celebrate Christmas, you don't have to identify as a Unitarian Universalist to appreciate and celebrate these ideals!  The seven principles are:<br />
<blockquote><b>1. The inherent worth and dignity of every person;<br />
2. Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;<br />
3. Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;<br />
4. A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;<br />
5. The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;<br />
6. The goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all;<br />
7. Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.</b></blockquote></p>

Join the Movement to help build schools, connect students, and inspire communities in need through music. Local musician and producer, William Aura, produced the part of this movie that was filmed in India. He recorded some Tibetan musicians and played bass on one of the songs. We hope to have a screening of the film soon here in Ojai.</p>

<p>From the award-winning documentary, "Playing For Change: Peace Through Music", comes the first of many "songs around the world" being released independently. Featured is a cover of the Ben E. King classic by musicians around the world adding their part to the song as it travelled the globe. This and other songs such as "One Love" will be released as digital downloads soon; followed by the film soundtrack and DVD early next year.</p>

He took us up to the 80-acre Ilvento Preserve, the first property the OVLC acquired in 1997.  I last went on this 2-mile hike with the OVLC <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2006/06/ojai_valley_land_conservancy_c.shtml">in the spring of 2006</a> to write a story for the Sierra Clubâs local paper, and although the wildflower sightings were abundant, so, too, were the ticks.  This time, the dry weather kept the ticks away, but Rick took the time to give his now famous Tick Talk, which served to give us all the willies.  About a mile into the hike are some of the most spectacular views in the valley.  I snapped this photo of Rick with my cell phone at the preserveâs highest point, 2024 feet, offering views of Lake Casitas and, on clear days, the Pacific.  The Ilvento Preserve is open year-round to the public. For more information on the OVLC, to become a member (itâs cheap!) or to find out about their guided hikes, <a href="http://ovlc.org/">check-out their Web site</a> for dates, times and reservation information.</p>

The first one, Votes of the Women, aroused a large interest in the Ojai community in 2001. The second, Sing Me Your Story, Dance Me Home: Art and Poetry from Native California will also be a âmust-seeâ because of the museumâs access to these engaging, high quality exhibits.</p>

<p>All over the world people have handed down their stories, be they English ballads, Irish whaling tunes, native and Inuit and African-American tribal stories and tunes. All stories have played and important role in our collective oral history. Native California and Chumash traditions, arts, and crafts have done this in the same way for California. Like the state itself, the California Native peoples are remarkably diverse with over 300 languages and distinct geographical centers that shape communities, traditions, ideologies and ceremonies. The works exhibited in Sing Me Your Story, Dance Me Home are embedded with California forests, rivers, deserts, valleys and mountains. Native California surrounds us everywhere we look.</p>

<p>Judging is weighted and online voting will count for 20%, which will start soon at www.mavric-awards.com.  Also, look forward to hearing more about MAVRIC week, giving nominees a chance to perform live before the winners are announced in January.</p>

<p>The MAVRIC Awards will take place on Sunday, January 25th at the Thousand Oaks Civic Center.  Last year's awards show was absolutely fantastic - sort of like our very own Grammies!

<p>The singer/songwriter sued McCain in August after the Republican candidate for the highest office in the land used his song, âRunning on Empty,â in a campaign commercial that targeted Obamaâs energy plan. At the time, many didnât take the legal threat very seriously, but based on two motions filed this week in U.S. District Court in California, the McCain campaign sure does. </p>

<p>The second filing is...an anti-SLAPP motion, which is typically used by defendants as a way to seek monetary damages after a plaintiff has subjected a defendant to a lawsuit meant to chill free speech. So far, McCain is only looking for attorneyâs fees and costs, but claiming an artist has interfered with free speech is quite the poke of an eye in show business. </p>

<p><strong>Jimi Hendrix's drummer Mitch Mitchell dies</strong><br />
BBC</p>

<p>Mitch Mitchell, the British drummer in the seminal 1960s band the Jimi Hendrix Experience, has been found dead in his US hotel room, authorities say. The 61-year-old was discovered in the Benson Hotel in Portland, Oregon, in the early hours of Wednesday. A medical examiner told Associated Press news agency the death appeared to be from natural causes but that there would be an autopsy.</p>

Comment #10 Posted by: another anonymousâ*</p>

<p>This afternoon as I crossed the street to go into the post office I noticed that the Ojai Theatre marquee still announced the Ojai Film Festival.  It's Monday, another work week and our attention moves on to upcoming events.  But this year's film festival marks the beginning of a new direction for the festival. <br />
OFF treasurer Bill Monot in opening statements before Saturday night's gala event noted that the festival happened during this worsening financial climate.  I don't know what the numbers are as far as attendance.  There were many screenings that were not very well attended.  And others were full, like the gala event at the Ojai Valley Inn on Saturday night.    </p>

Thank you for all you gave and all you endured. Ms Makeba, known as Mama Africa, was born in Johannesburg in 1932 and was a leading symbol in the struggle against apartheid.

                              <p>President-elect Obama's press conference was 30 minutes late getting started, so I hopped on my bike to make the 12:30pm screenings.  Seeing how the film maker's party would be there, I decided to stay for all the screenings.  I got there just after the doors had closed.  I slipped into the back row as a moderator was speaking of Hope Frazier.  It took me a minute to figure out she was speaking of the film Hope made about her hometown and how it complimented the main feature, then lights were dimmed and the first film began.  PROCRASTINATION is a 4 minute animated short from the UK by student film maker Johnny Kelly.</p>

<p>âWill someone please shove something up my #$@ AND MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I'M ALIVE AGAIN!!!"</p>

<p>That quote is from a disgruntled guest attending last year's<a href="http://ojaifilmfestival.com"> OFF</a> film makers party.  I laughed remembering the situation which prompted the remark as I bicycled to the Ojai Valley Inn  to pick up my press credential.  This year, festival organizers hope to erase the memory of last year's debacle with a strategy to bring the festival's profile up a notch.  Leading the way is OFF chairman<a href="http://www.dshor.com"> David Shor</a>.  With sponsorship   from Ojai Valley Inn & Spa and the first Annual Ojai film Festival Celebrity Golf Classic, along with an expanded program, organizers have a long range vision of attracting a wider regional audience.  I ran into David at OFF's makeshift office at the inn's Shangri la Pavilion.  He was in a mad dash of finish last minute details before the opening night party that included a silent and live auction, golf tournament award ceremony, and the traditional free outdoor movie screening.  </p>

<p>I first heard Yma Sumac when I was a little boy. My mother had her first album. I was captivated  by the evocative nature of her voice. She passed away today at the age of 86.</p>

                              <p>The <a href="http://ojaifilmfestival.com/">Ojai Film Festival </a>asked me to be their official podcaster this year, which led me to an amazing interview with <a href="http://www.sergioaragones.com/">Sergio Aragones</a>, the world's fastest cartoonist and creator of the 2008 Ojai Film Festival poster and program cover.  Sergio talked with me about his life as a cartoonist, his 40 years with MAD Magazine, his love of film and what brought him to Ojai 25 years ago.  At 71 years old, with a handle bar mustache, long gray pony tail and deep Spanish accent, I found him to be engaging and utterly charming.

<p><strong>1) Do you now or have you in the past personally supported "Stop the Trucks!"</p>

<p><em>Yes, I have and I will continue to do so.</em></p>

<p>2) If so, please give examples of actions you have actually taken.</p>

<p><em>I have donated money.  I am also actively speaking out about your organization "Stop the Trucks" and letting people know that I will do everything I can to support the cause when I am elected.</em></p>

<p>3) Do you believe the Ojai City Council should take a more active role in the truck campaign, such as providing funding and legal support?</p>

<p><em>The City Council has agreed to give financial support to the "Stop the Trucks" organization.  There are some legal hurdles that need to be addressed, but I believe we need to find a way to make it happen.</em> </strong></p>

<p>In a August 21, 2006 letter regarding the Ozena Valley Ranch Mining project, the Board of the Ojai Valley Municipal Advisory Council warned Christopher Stephens, then the Director of Planning for the Ventura County Planning Division and now the head of the entire Resource Managment Agency for the County,  that <em>"SR-33 has suffered many landslides and slipped roadways in past years.  The vibration created by the mine's trucks on SR-33 may be adding significantly to the problem of road slippage, slumps, and slides. No review of vibration as a potential impact on SR-33 has been included in the Draft MND and vibration from trucks may present a significant adverse impact on the environment."</em></p>

<p>In February of 2008 a portion of Route 33 collapsed into the river.  Below are a dozen photographs of the damage done, indicating the collapse was far more significant than originally reported.<br />

Then, this year, with original producer Cody LePow at the helm, they brought in Ojai's own James Antunez to replace Lanny's lead vocal with his soul jazz stylings. Aran Kaufer just recently created a video for it and put it up on YouTube in support of Barack Obama's campaign. Echoing the song's refrain, Lanny says that, "Now's the time to believe in the good we can do."</p>

<p>The Kaufer family's first YouTube video, "You Rock, Barack," accessible from this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmXmnOwMCp4">YouTube</a> link under the heading "more from: kaufer2008," has been viewed by over 25,000 people since December. A third Obama video, "Rise," a solo project by Aran, can also be found there.</p>

<p> Ninth Annual Ojai Film Festival spools out its programs November 6 â 9 with 57 independent films, lifetime achievement honor ceremonies, and a seminar to fill in the four-day event.  Hosting sponsor and headquarters for the festival is the premiere AAA five-diamond award-winning resort, the Ojai Valley Inn & Spa.  </p>

<p>Ojai has become a viable path for filmmakers and their work to get noticed. Hollywood producer, Peter Guber said of the Ojai FF at the podium of the Toronto Film Festival last year, âOjai is the next Telluride!â  That festivalis like Ojai, a four-day event focused on films one would not otherwise see in the mainstream but of a very high caliber.  Artistic Director, Steve Grumette, who was one of the founders of the festival in 2000 said,  âThere are so many more films being made since the advent of digital technology, and in the past eight years, the festival has sent over a dozen films on to win the highest honors in the industry, including Academy Award nominations and Oscars.â<br />

<p>"Stop the Trucks" has turned its attention from Diamond Rock to the Ozena Valley Ranch and Gravel mine.</p>

<p><em>At Tuesday nightâs City Council meeting the council agreed to give financial support to the Stop the Trucks Coalition, after a victory for the citizensâ group in August...</p>

<p>âAfter this agreement has been worked out, keeping the Diamond Rock Mineâs trucks out of Ojai, it has been pretty clear to me that whatever this group did, they did it successfully,â said Mayor Sue Horgan.</em></p>

<p>If you love a good Pac 10 rivalry and a cold frosty beer as part of your Saturday activities, then make a point of being at Ojai Day on October 18 in downtown Ojai.<br />
Ojaiâs premier cultural event and street fair has taken another step forward this year by providing a beer and wine garden in the Los Caporales parking lot next to Libbey Park. And a big screen TV will be set up in the beer garden for the football game between the Stanford Cardinal and UCLA Bruins beginning at 2 p.m. Note able Nordhoff High School Alum Micah Reed is the center for the Bruins. </p>

<p><strong>This Tuesday, October 14th, at 7:30 pm the Ojai City Council will meet for its regular session.  Part of the agenda will be devoted to discussions on how to co-ordinate efforts to deal with the Ozena Valley Ranch & Gravel Mine's proposed renewal and modification of their C.U.P. with the County of Ventura.</p>

<p>Given the well documented negative impact of these highly disruptive and polluting mining and trucking operations on agriculture, fishing,  the economy, our water supply, our environment and the health of our children, the "Stop the Trucks" Coalition urges everyone in the Ojai Valley to attend and share your opinions with the City Council.</strong></p>

<strong>In documents recently obtained by the Ojai "Stop the Trucks"  through a Ventura County Public Records Request, the Coalition has learned that Ozena wants to alter their existing permit so that trucking through the Ojai Valley will begin as early as 3:00 am and continue as late as 6:00 pm during the week with "No Route Restrictions" at all on Saturdays!</p>

<p>This proposal would more than double trucking from a total of seven hours a day during the week to a new and even more intrusive and disturbing 15 hours a day!</strong></p>

<p>In a recent review of weigh tickets from 2007, the  "Stop the Trucks" Coalition estimated that Ozena is likely now violating existing permit hours in trips through Ojai by as much as 55%.  In a letter to "Stop the Trucks," County CEO, Ms. Marty Robinson, agreed with the Coalition that violations have been under reported by the Planning Division.</p>

<p>In a further review of emails obtained through that same Records Request, we found that the agent for Ozena, John Hecht of West Coast Environmental & Engineering, rejected the consultant the County originally selected, URS, because: <em> "...the proposed costs did not appear in line to the anticipated scope of work.  Ozena believes that a competitive process will provide a qualified CEQA contractor in a more cost effective manner."</em></p>

<p>In a separate email Mr. Hecht then went on to propose the names of three other firms:</p>

<p>In a letter to  the Ojai "Stop the Trucks" Coalition, Ventura County CEO, Ms. Marty Robinson, wrote: <em>"After the CEO's office reviewed the July and August 2007 weigh tickets tickets communicated by the RMA" (Resource Management Agency) "a statistically significant sampling of the 649 original tickets was conducted by our office and it was determined that potential  northbound violations were omitted from consideration by the Planning Division.  If these potential northbound violations had been included , the number of violations would have been materially higher..."</em></p>

<p>"Stop the Trucks" had previously reported that upwards of 55% of all Ozena related trips through the Ojai Valley were likely in violation of these rules.</p>

<p>Hello All,<br />
Please note that Robben's concerts at Matilija are at 4 and 7:30, there was some confusion about the start times. The concerts are sold-out, however, we have heard from a few people that bought tickets that they won't be able to attend, and they have re-donated their tix to sell to others. If you or someone you know would like to attend and don't have tix, please just show up at Matilija Jr High School with $35 cash in hand. I also think we can accommodate 20 or so walk-ups.<br />
see you there!<br />
Anne<br />
</p>

He sent it to me on Tuesday and I only just now got around to posting it.  Meanwhile, it has already played on Air America Radio on the Thom Hartman Show, and John Kerry's office grabbed it for an Obama rally this Saturday in North Carolina.  <a href="http://radioojai.com/2008/09/20/the-sarahdippity-singers-of-ojai-wasilla-girl.aspx">Take a listen</a>, all the way through, because the ending is priceless.</p>

                              <p>I thought it would be interesting to get to know the real Brian Cox, so I sat down with him to talk about bee farming in the Ojai Valley, and a couple other things.  Brian talks a little about what has affected the bee population, how not to get stung and why itâs important to close the door to the honey room.  He also talks about being the lone conservative voice on these pages and gives a plug for a presidential candidate.  Tune in to the full 12-minute interview on <a href="http://radioojai.com/">Radio Ojai</a>, where you can also hear an interview with Smitty West and new music from Delaney Gibson.</p>

<p>Last week in a Ventura County Star article by Tony Biasotti, Ventura County officials conceded that there are significant problems in the Planning Division but the real questions is this:  Are they Willing To Change?</p>

<p>http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/sep/04/officials-concede-land-use-problems/</p>

<p>According to Biasotti Ventura County officials hosted an unusual meeting in a conference room just off of the courthouse cafeteria.</p>

<p>"Everyone on our team has affirmed we have a problem here," Matt Carroll, the top deputy to County Executive Officer Marty Robinson, said at the opening of the meeting. "The facts speak for themselves."</p>

<p>"Complaints about the system from developers and property owners are nothing new..."  " But this time, the county is listening and often agreeing..."</p>

<p>"Last year, the county commissioned a report on its land-use procedures by Tom Berg, a consultant who once held (Chris) Stephens' current position as Resource Management Agency director. Based on interviews with 75 people in and out of county government, Berg's report concluded that the land-use process was in need of "systemic changes."</p>

<p>"The county put together a committee of high-level managers, including Carroll and Stephens, to analyze Berg's recommendations and start putting them into action."</p>

<p><strong>Suza Francina was the first of the five candidates competing for two City Council vacancies to respond to our questions for candidates. (see below)  "Stop the Trucks" hopes the other City Council candidates and those running for the MAC (Municipal Advisory Council) will take a few moments to <u>answer a few questions online</u>.  We would like each candidate to share their thoughts with the public on the how they intend to deal with the long term threat posed by gravel trucking through Ojai and the blind eye that the Ventura County Planning Division is seemingly paying to regular daily violations of the existing Conditional Use Permits (C.U.P.'s). </strong></p>

<p>During the Opening Ceremonies for the Olympics, China celebrated the achievements of the great navel fleets of the Ming Dynasty, events hardly known or recounted in the West.</p>

<p>By 1405 China had been a powerful empire for nearly two thousand years. The crown jewels of Emperor Zhu Diâs navy were his Treasure boats. These behemoths, nearly half the size of World War II aircraft carriers, were largest wooden sailing ships ever built. And although the wealth they carried back to China was staggering, it created conflict between the two factions that served the emperor; the Military and the Mandarin bureaucrats.</p>

<p>After the emperorâs death, the chief Mandarin sought to undermine the power of his foes by decreeing that the fleets be grounded, the records destroyed and overseas trade forbidden.  The result crippled China for the next 600 years - a decline that is only being reversed today as witnessed during the Olympics.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>As I move on to the next leg of my career in promoting the arts, I no longer feel that having a static "brick and mortar" space is essential to cultivating rich and innovative art experiences. My passion to provide opportunities for artists and the art community remains the same. Please stay tuned for future projects presented by Nathan Larramendy â it will only get better!</p>

Ray Smith of Daly Road Graphics sent us these notes and photographs about Gravel Trucks in which it appears that trucks coming and going from Santa Paula are driving on residential streets.  If true this would a clear violation of local road and traffic regulations.  While we await further confirmation, here is Ray's first person report: </strong></p>

<p><strong><em>" I spotted another truck near my home.  Apparently, they are coming from Santa Paula, but instead of going through downtown via Ojai Avenue, they cut north to Grand Avenue.  They head east, turn onto West Summer St., <br />
then south on Canada to pick up Ojai Avenue again.   This is the third time I've seen one do this. "</em></strong></p>

<strong>With five candidates competing for two City Council vacancies and several of the MAC (Municipal Advisory Council) seats also facing competitive races, the Ojai "Stop the Trucks!" Coalition is asking everyone running for office to take a few moments to <u>answer a few questions online</u>.  We would like each candidate to share their thoughts with the public on the how they intend to deal with the long term threat posed by gravel trucking through Ojai and the blind eye that the Ventura County Planning Division is seemingly paying to regular daily violations of the existing Conditional Use Permits (C.U.P.'s). </strong><br />

<p>April Hendrix, Ojaiâs own soul star, will debut her new band and original songs on <b>Sunday, August 24, beginning at 6:30 PM at The Farmer & the Cook, 339 W. El Roblar Drive in Meiners Oaks</b>. Well known around the county and beyond as the lead singer for blues outfit Baby Sister and soul/funk band Soul Star Express, April is forging ahead with a brand new sound combining elements of soul, blues, rock, funk and hip hop. She has been hard at work writing songs with partners from across the musical spectrum and now has assembled a smoking hot band to deliver her sound to the world.<br />
  <br />
Anchored by bassist Aron Von Alstine and drummer Greg Weiser, her band includes local favorites Sunny Erickson on guitar and David Gorospe on keys, both members of the popular funk groove band Euphoria.<br />
  <br />
The daughter of a professional backup singer, April Hendrix comes from a strong musical lineage. Besides her famous cousin Jimi, her uncles âSpudâ and Jerome Hendrix were stalwarts of many Ventura county bands. Often traveling with her mother on the road, Aprilâs earliest memories of performing are in the backseat of the car, singing along with her motherâs demo tapes. But Sharon âMuffyâ Hendrix made her daughter promise she would get an education before she pursued a music career. So April found a way to do both.</p>

And although the wealth they carried back to China was staggering, it created conflict between the two factions that served the emperor; the Military and the Mandarin bureaucrats.</p>

<p><strong>HELP US STOP THE TRUCKS!<br />
By Michael Shapiro, Chairman / Stop The Trucks! Coalition</strong></p>

<p>Repeating what I wrote last week in my Ojai Valley News Guest Editorial -- various news reports about the recent Santa Barbara-based Diamond Rock Mine didnât tell the full story.  It is simply not true that the Stop the Trucks! Coalition prevailed during the recent hearings before the Santa Barbara Planning Commission, and thatâs why weâre appealing the decision of the Santa Barbara Planning Commission to approve the Diamond Rock Mineâs Environmental Impact Report (EIR).  If we donât, it paves the way for the granting of their Conditional Use Permit (CUP) and simultaneously strips-away any of Ojaiâs legal rights to challenge them in the event that they âchange their mindsâ and hundreds of rock and gravel mine-transport trucks end-up careening through Ojai after all.  <br />

<p><em>(photo credit,  Rob Varela, Ventura County Star)</em></p>

<p>Below are some of the highlights from <em>Ventura County Star</em> reporter Tony Biasotti's article last week.</p>

<p>"Until last year, it was common for Bob Walker to wake up before dawn to the sound of grinding engine brakes, as a caravan of gravel trucks passed his house. 'When they're coming through at 2:30 or 3 a.m., and you're sleeping, it gets pretty loud,' Walker said during a recent interview at his home, just north of Ojai on Highway 33. 'At one point, it was an everyday thing.'"</p>

<p>â¦But many Ojai residents still chafe at what they see as enough truck traffic to turn their bucolic city into a loud, smoggy, congested mess. Ventura County (Planning Division), they say, has ignored their concerns. Walker filed three complaints against one mining company, starting in 2005, and said the county never acknowledged any of them until a few months ago.<br />

<p>âA broad coalition of Ojai residents, environmentalists, business owners, public officials and educators launched a blistering attack June 17 on county planners overseeing permits for mining operations.  </p>

<p>Ventura County Chief Executive Officer Marty Robinson confirmed county officials plan to discuss allegations in a letter sent by Stop the Trucks Coalition Vice-Chair Howard Smith about oversight of the controversial Ozena Valley Ranch mine.â</p>

<p>This song, <em>Quiet Inside</em>, was written and performed by a good buddy of mine, <a href="http://www.skinnytubs.com/" target="_blank">Andy Tubman</a> of <a href="http://www.janedoes.com/" target="_blank">The Jane Does</a>.   It was featured over the closing credits in the movie "The Jacket" featuring Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley.  A fan did the slideshow underneath the song.  Hope you enjoy.</p>

The <a href="http://www.azconsulatela.org/" target="_blank">Consul General of Azerbaijan</a>, Elin Suleymanov, has written a story that looks back upon their visit.

<p><strong>Bringing Azerbaijani Mugham to Ojai</strong><br />
By Elin Suleymanov</p>

<p>When I first visited Ojai it reminded me of the Caucasus Mountains of my home- Azerbaijan. Perhaps, this almost nostalgic feeling made coming back to Ojai inevitable. Moreover, when planning California concerts of Mugham, the most spiritual part of Azerbaijanâs musical heritage, a performance in Ojai seemed an obvious choice. After all, what could a better place for a concert of the music strongly influenced by Sufism than a community so familiar with spiritual teachings?</p>

Oregon woman plans to parade topless on July 4 <br />
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS<br />
Filed at 6:51 p.m. ET</p>

<p>ASHLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A woman seen frequently in Ashland riding topless on her bicycle says she plans to be in Ashland's Fourth of July parade free and independent of all clothing but a hemp G-string. The Chamber of Commerce says that's contrary to the rules for the family celebration. She says she'll sue if she can't parade as she wishes.</p>

<p>Jen Moss has been known as ''The Naked Lady'' since she moved to Ashland in May from Ojai, Calif., drawn by the town's nudity laws. They specify only that people must cover their genitalia in a city park or the downtown commercial district, which means Moss need not cover her breasts.</p>

<p>The police in California, she says, harassed her when she rode her bicycle wearing a G-string and pasties.</p>

<p>Moss applied for an entry for the parade, which draws thousands each year.</p>

<p>The Ashland Chamber of Commerce learned of her coverage plans from an online posting. She promised to lead in-line skaters ''wearing only a hemp G-string and blowing a conch shell.''</p>

<p>''We don't feel that someone in the parade who is topless or nearly naked is appropriate for a family audience,'' said parade chairman James Kidd.</p>

                              <p>The Ojai Music Festival is known for its adventurous spirit, for its lust for risk -- musically speaking. </p>

<p>In turn, Libbey Bowl audiences are known for their patience, and often they are rewarded with the&nbsp; unforgettable. When Steve Reich's difficult &quot;Four Organs&quot; was premiered in New York in the early l970's, a near-riot erupted. When played for the first time on the west coast In Ojai in the same era, the piece piqued interest and resulted in a recording (according to a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-ojai10-2008jun10,0,7294146.story">story</a> recounted by Mark Swed in today's <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.) </p>

<p>Last Saturday night at Libbey Bowl the festival broke away from its celebration of the hypnotic music of&nbsp; Reich for an exploration into the outer limits of voice and music today. The evening began with a baffling piece in which one woman alone sang wordlessly against an array of electronica without a beat. </p>

<p>But what followed was something else.</p>

<p>Mesmerizingly so. </p>

<p>Described as a &quot;spoken opera&quot; by composer Michael Jarrell, &quot;Cassandre&quot; is actually a monologue with orchestral support, but most of all it's a stunning piece of writing, drawn from the ancient myth of Cassandra, as written by one of the greatest of German writers today, the novelist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christa_Wolf">Christa Wolf</a>. </p>

<p>Barbara Sukowa, a compelling actress with a guttural voice, growled her way through an English translation of the monologue. This was the West Coast premiere of the piece. Here's how it begins: 

<p>Cassandra is a ruined woman. Once she was a princess, but now she has been brought low by a god.Because she refused Apollo, he spit into her mouth, and forever after she was cursed to speak the truth to all, but be believed by no one. <br /> </p></p>

<p>&quot;Sounds like the Al Gore story,&quot; said one fellow in my section.</p>

                              <p>Many of you may remember when i last attended the Memorial Day events here in the Ojai Valley in 2006, after which i wrote <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2006/05/my_memorial_day_in_ojai.shtml">this report</a> which brought up issues of patriotism, accountability, veteran-civilian relations, and the meaning of supporting the troops while opposing the war.</p>

<p>This year's Memorial Day was quite different for me, but not so much because of the local events.  i have made some significant personal strides relative to the above issues by listening to the testimony of warriors at the Winter Soldier 2008 event, responding to my brother's choice to join the Marine Corps Reserves, reading some of the local veterans' stories in their book "Ojai Valley's Veterans Stories", and connecting to local organizers of Iraq Veterans Against the War.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>At this time in 2006 i didn't have a nine-month-old daughter, so i was a little slower getting out the door this time.  i missed the pancake breakfast at the American Legion building in Oak View, but caught the last half of the parade, where i noted several violations of the <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/russki/infousa/facts/flag_code.htm">Federal Flag Code</a>.  After the parade a sizable crowd gathered at Longhorn's Feed & Supply to hear speakers and for the awarding of the parade trophies.   i approached as Ms. Shelley Rhoades was reading the same poem she read last time in Libbey Park, while Boy Scout Troop 503 did the same enigmatic flag-passing ceremony.  i began to wonder what was going to happen at the park.<br />
Some guy took the "stage" and led us all in prayer to a Christian God, thanking him for our community and lifestyle and for helping us preserve it, in Jesus' name.  Veteran Al Wescott sang his original song "Soldiers, Sailors, and Tired Old Men", just like he did in 2006.  The teen girls in their long satin dresses and label-sashes gave out awards to everything from a bagpiper to a llama (although i think it was an alpaca, technically) to "pooper scoopers".  People clapped and cheered, then left.  </p>

<p><strong>Gravel Haulers Prohibited Through Ojai, Los Padres<br />
Trucks Brake for Highway 33</strong></p>

<p><br />
"The main artery through Ojai, State Route 33 sits in western Ventura County, just a few miles from the Santa Barbara County border. Along Route 33 sit schools, hospitals, shopping malls, and Ojaiâs busiest intersection. What it will not accommodateâââto the relief of many Ojai residentsâââis the daily rumbling of hundreds of semi trucks carrying thousands of pounds of gravel to construction sites throughout Santa Barbara and Ventura counties..."</p>

<p>âThe Highway 33 corridor is not suitable for these big trucks,â said 1st District Planning Commissioner Michael Cooney..."  "...Michael Shapiro of the Stop the Trucks Coalition, citing the air quality impact on the health, safety, and welfare of those living or traveling near Route 33, said industrial traffic through Ojai would have had a palpable and âscaryâ impact on residents, creating an industrial feel that could potentially harm the valleyâs income from its reputation for arts and tourism. âIt [would have] totally, adversely affected the economy,â Shapiro said..."<br />

<p><strong>On involvement<br />
If you're going to complain, get involved </p>

<p>From Bill Lascher, Editor of the Ventura Reporter:</strong></p>

<p>"As has been groused about numerous times on these pages and society in general, too many people whine about the actions taken by government and other institutions without ever taking action to challenge those institutions. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Some lament in Ventura County that red tape and not-in-my-backyard-minded activists hinder progress. Yet, without a vigilant active community little would be done to help the vast majority of our citizens, many decisions would be taken with myopic profit motives and few socially minded initiatives would get off the ground...."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"...Now, the first signs are emerging of other successes by local activists, even as new fights take shape...."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"...Ojai residents concerned about mining truck traffic along Route 33 have scored something of a victory and will have a chance to ensure that victory holds May 14. That day, the Santa Barbara County Planning Commission will consider final action on the proposed Diamond Rock mine. After criticism of the mine's plans to use Highway 33 to transport material and other environmental concerns that might impact Ventura County more than Santa Barbara County, the plan was altered to prevent trucks from traveling south on 33, to reduce its production rates and truck trips to avoid situations where those truck trips might be necessary, and to address other environmental concerns. It is a testament to the continued involvement and dedication of Ojai and Cuyama Valley residents - as well as the mine owner's willingness to discuss community concerns - that such progress was made..."</p>

                              <p>The Ojai Music Festival is leading the way in a $3 million Libbey Bowl renovation.  Based on an <a href="http://ojaivalleynews.blogspot.com/2008/05/libbey-bowl-to-get-3m-makeover.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OVN article</a>, it appears that the bowl is a tear-down, with a working 2010 timeline.  </p>

<blockquote>Both [Ojai Music Festival executive director Jeff] Haydon and [architect and former mayor David] Bury expressed confidence in the 2010 time line for the project. "We are hoping the design process will take about a year," Bury said. The construction company Jones and Jones will be doing the dismantle and rebuild, which is expected to take from eight to 12 months after the bureaucratic process is complete.  "Culturally and historically, this is a really important project and some people want to be involved just because of that," said Bury, "so I think we will get a lot of advice from the experts."</blockquote>

<p>Mugham, the classical music of Azerbaijan, is usually a suite with poetry and instrumental interludes. The sung poetry sometimes includes tahrir segments, which use a form of throat singing similar to yodelling. The poetry is typically about divine love and is most often linked to Sufi Islam. In contrast to the mugham traditions of Central Asian countries, Azeri mugham is more free-form and less rigid; it is often compared to the improvised field of jazz.  </p>

<p>Take the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=BpFjn_2bN64FQ1bxo_2bV2DmkQ_3d_3d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Libbey Bowl Survey</a> here.</p>

<p>My fondest Libbey Bowl memory is actually from before we moved here.  We were camping in Wheeler Gorge for a couple nights, and came into town to watch a movie being shown in Libbey Bowl.  We sat on the benches, looking up through the magnificent oaks, where Mars was at is closest point to the earth and shone through, between the branches of the tree.  Magical moments like that make Ojai one of the greatest places in the world.</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon, April 8th, members of "Stop the Trucks" coalition successfully testified before the Ventura County Board of Supervisors at their regular weekly meeting after a presentation by consultant Tom Berg, who had been hired to assess issues and problems at the county's Resource Management Agency which includes the Planning Division.  </p>

<p>The Coalition stressed the need for monitoring and enforcement of permit conditions, particularly of gravel mine operations, a fact that was reflected back by four of the Supervisors to County staff at the end of the meeting.<br />
The Planning Division currently is responsible for oversight of the Conditional Use Permit (CUP) issued to the Ozena Mine and Gravel operation.</p>

<p>According to an article in the Ventura County Star by Tony Biasotti on Wednesday, April 9, 2008, Berg's noted <em>that there are there are many ways in which the county could be more "transparent, predictable and accountable."<br />
And, " the system has some problems."  </em></p>

<p><em>It was Spring, yet I had lost that in my step. In my driveway lay a blue dragonfly, motionless and rigid like the brown earthbound autumn leaves. I picked up the winged one and placed it in my palm. So light, it's weight imperceptible in my hand. It seemed strange to have one born of flight, of air and river life, leave it's remains on an asphalt grave. A metaphor, my life in my hands. Breathing three times, gentle, warm, across the cross that lay so still. Then, a tremble, a tickle, a straight vertical ascension, above the treetops and out of sight. This is where the miraculous meets the mundane, and the future moves beyond our imagination.</em></p>

<p>Congrats, Raymond.  Please stay on the line and our producer will get your info and send you a package.</p>

<p>From the Web site: <br />
"Bus Stop is the 1950s romantic comedy about a group of travelers tossed together during a Kansas snowstorm. The film, by Academy Award and Pulitzer Prize-winner William Inge, starred Marilyn Monroe and Don Murray. While exuberant and comical on the surface, at its core this play is a tenderhearted tale of love, loneliness and longing, revealing our deep hunger for companionship and understanding. Rubiconâs production stars Broadway and West End actress Angela Christian and regional theatre sensation Jason Chanos, with screen veteran and Ojai resident John Bennett Perry as Virgil. Let the warmth of this great American classic melt your winter blues!â<br />

I'm looking forward to attending this year - I've heard so many fun stories about it, but haven't made my way down to Libbey Bowl yet.  </p>

<p><strong>I have a pair of tickets to give away</strong> to the March 22nd Bill Harley and Niall de BÃºrca <a href="https://secure1.securewebexchange.com/webclassicsplus.com/ptgo/fresh.cfm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">benefit</a>, with proceeds to go to the Village of Tales Storytelling Festival.  Bill Harley is a nationally acclaimed storyteller and winner of a Grammy Award while Niall de Burca is considered one of Irelandâs treasures.</p>

<p>Let's try this for the giveaway.  In honor of The Ojai Post's upcoming ten thousandth comment (today or tomorrow), leave a story in this thread, 100 words or less.  I'll pick a couple impartial judges and the winner will get the tickets.</p>

<p>Some basic ground rules - the story must be yours.  It has to have happened in Ventura County.  No plagiarism, embellishment accepted.  Points for style, wit, humor and pathos.  Contest closes at the end of Monday, March 10.</p>

                              <p>I was lucky enough to catch local yoga teacher Amy Arani at the <a href="http://www.socalmusician.com">SoCal Musician</a> showcase at the Ventura Theater Friday night.  Amy plays piano and was backed by three Ojai musicians (Will Makiling on drums, <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/chrisfoley.shtml">Chris Foley</a> on guitar, Dave Anter on bass) for most of her set.  Amy's rich voice reminded me at times of Natalie Merchant, Cher, Sarah MacLachlan, Siouxie Sioux (remember the Banshees?) with a touch of Tori Amos.  </p>

<p>Comparisons aside, her voice is fantastic.  Amy will be graduating from UCSB in a couple of weeks and hopefully focusing more on her music.  Meantime you can visit her at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/amyarani ">http://www.myspace.com/amyarani </a>.  She's playing this Wednesday at the Experimental Cafe in Oxnard at 9:45pm.</p>

<p><strong>In this Sunday's edition of the Ventura County Star, we see barracades divert traffic around a section of Maricopa Highway - Route 33 - about 10 miles north of Ojai that has collapsed into the North Fork of Matilija Creek.</p>

<p>http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/feb/24/portion-of-hwy-33-still-closed-to-traffic/</p>

<p>Only residents and emergency personnnel are allowed to use northbound lanes.  For all other vehicles, the CHP expects a long-term closure of the highway between Lockwood Valley to the north, where most of the gravel mines in dispute are located, and Matilija Road and the Ojai Valley to the south.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bridge on Highway 33 Collapses: No One Hurt</strong></p>

<p>A bridge support beam failure caused 130 to 150 feet of embankment along south-bound Highway 33 above Ojai to slide into the North Fork of Matilija Creek on Friday evening, authorities said.</p>

<p>The roadway was empty at the time of the collapse and no one was hurt, California Highway Patrol officials sad.</p>

<p>The bridge, located 10 to 12 miles north of Ojai, reportedly gave way about 6:15 p.m., according to the CHP.</p>

<p>Only southbound lanes were affected, officials said and northbound lanes remained open to residents and emergency personnel.</p>

<p><strong>For all other vehicles, the CHP expects a long-term closure of the highway between Lockwood Valley Road to the north and Matilija Road to the south.</strong></p>

<p>Caltrans crews worked to repair the roadway Friday night, authorities said.</p>

<p>Christmas in Ojai from Daly Road Graphics </p>

<p><br />
<strong>On February 1, 2008 "Stop the Trucks," filed the following formal complaint against the Ozena Mine with the head of the Ventura County Planning Division, Kim Rodriguez:</strong></p>

<p>Please consider this letter on behalf of Ojai residents, John Broesamle, Howard Smith and the âStop the Trucksâ coalition a formal request to re-open the investigation of possible C.U.P violations on August 14, 2007 in the operation of gravel trucks in conjunction with the Ozena Valley Sand and Gravel Mine.</p>

<p>The Ojai âStop the Trucks Coalition is comprised of the City of Ojai; Forestwatch; the Ojai Valley Chamber of Commerce; the Ojai Valley School District; the Ojai Valley Board of Realtors; and many hundreds of private citizens.</p>

<p>In your  September 27, 2007 letter to Howard Smith (prepared by Pat Richards) and your January 8, 2008 letter to John Broesamle, the department denies both complaints of early morning and late afternoon CUP truck violations by citing the weigh tickets provided to the Planning Department by Ozena.  </p>

<p>After an extensive forensic study of the weigh tickets turned over to the Planning Division by the agent for Ozena, John Hecht of West Coast Environmental & Engineering, âStop the Trucks,â now firmly believes that the use of self-prepared weigh tickets, which appear to be the sole tool used by the division to monitor truck traffic, is not valid.  It is a method in which the results can seemingly be manipulated at will by the mine operator; and/or the weigh master; the trucking contractor; and/or their designated drivers; and may result in fraud or misrepresentation of the facts.  Clearly they fail the test as the evidentiary basis for any claims, pro or con.  </p>

<p>Details of our review are in the  âAnalysisâ provided both below and attached separately. <br />

I can't believe Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" didn't make the list.  And the one my husband and I love, The Smith's, "A Light That Never Goes Out," also didn't make the cut. What could be more romantic than these lyrics: "And if a double-decker bus/crashes in to us/to die by your side/is such a heavenly way to die./And if a ten-ton truck/kills the both of us/to die by your side/well, the pleasure, the privilege, is mine?"  Romantic, funny and sad all at once.</p>

<p>During the course of a typical day, most people spend 16 hours with the head above the heart and the legs and pelvic area below the heart. Because of this, one of the first poses I teach students of all ages,  is "Legs Up the Wall Pose." <br />
 <br />
Supported Legs Up the Wall Pose (Viparita Karani in Sanskrit), known as Yogaâs Great Rejuvenator, is a gentle, inverted pose that can be practiced by almost everyone. It is a safe position that most people can hold long enough so that gravity can return the blood from the extremities to the vital organs.</p>

<p>Jack's fourth studio album, <em>Sleep Through The Static</em>, comes with this description:<br />
<blockquote>My friends and I have just finished recording a new album called Sleep Through the Static. At this point in my life I weigh about 190 lbs and my ear hairs are getting longer. I also have a couple of kids. My wife popped them out, but I helped. Some of the songs on this album are about making babies. Some of the songs are about raising them. Some of the songs are about the world that these children will grow up in; a world of war and love, and hate, and time and space. Some of the songs are about saying goodbye to people I love and will miss. <br />

                              <p>Ojai's native daughter, singer/songwriter Rain Perry, will open a ground-breaking show this weekend at Theater 150, guided and supported by her many wonderful friends, including Kim Maxwell, JB White, Deb Norton, Peter Bellwood, and Guy Webster. Her show is about growing up as a "wild child" raised by a hippie dad, and the good and the bad of that. I hope all of Ojai comes out to see it, because it's both funny and thoughtful, in Rain's inimitable style. </p>

<p>For more, plus a taste of one of the songs she will sing, please see a fuller <a href="http://achangeinthewind.typepad.com/achangeinthewind/2008/02/growing-up-nake.html">post</a> at my site, a slightly modified version of the cover story in this week's <em>VC Reporter</em>. </p>

<p>For now, here's a picture from Guy. Emotionally speaking, Rain bares all in this show. That's part of what makes it so touching.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.ojaipost.com/images/SmallHangingDogPose.jpg" width="450" alt="SmallHangingDogPose.jpg"/></p>

<p>The Downward-Facing Dog Pose, known in Sanskrit as <em>Adho Mukha Svanasana,</em> is named for the way dogs and other animals naturally stretch their bodies several times a day.  The shape of the pose resembles a dog stretching, with the arms and hands stretched out like a dogâs forepaws; the shoulders, spine and chest stretching; and the pelvis and tail bone high up in the air, stretching as far back away from the hands as possible. </p>

<p>When dogs stretch, they do so with great enjoyment--with all their heart and soul and a smile on their face! </p>

<p>Stretching daily in Downward-Facing Dog removes a lifetime of stiffness from the body and develops spinal strength and agility.<br />

<p>This joyous, exhilarating pose is known in yoga as <em>Hanumanasana</em>, the Monkey Pose. When you practice this fabulous stretching pose, it feels--and looks like-- you are taking a giant leap!  This powerful stretch, with the arms reaching up toward the heavens represents a "leap in consciousness," a change from one stage of life to the next. The inspiring teacher demonstrating the pose is in her 70's. <em>Hanumanasana</em>  is a fun pose to practice at the end of your yoga session, when your body is nice and warmed up from practicing Standing Poses, Downward Facing Dog Pose, Lunges and other Yoga Basics. In the beginning, the pose can be practiced by placing a bolster and folded blankets under the hips and  pelvis. </p>

He is bringing them an opportunity to create.  And he is doing great things for art lovers.  He is bringing them art from an unlikely place: homeless shelters.  He is doing all of this because he wants to shift perceptions.</p>

<p>The story of Ballard's nonprofit, <a href="http://heartsoffire.tv/home.php">Hearts of Fire</a>, is in this weekâs <em>VC Reporter</em>.  Excerpt:</p>

<p><em>Hearts of Fire has become a burning passion for Ballard, who admits, âIâm not trying to solve any problems, not find them housing and food. Iâm just looking for a way for them to express themselves.â </p>

<p>His next project is to bring the art tour local and travel up and down the coast to the five counties suffering the brunt of homelessness. This year, he will focus on 25 shelters from Santa Barbara southward, with art workshops followed by local exhibits that can be attended by the artists themselves. </p>

<p>âWeâre just really excited about whatâs going to happen next,â he said. </em></p>

<p>Hollywood and fans the world over were shocked last week when Oscar-nominated actor Heath Ledger, gaining fame for challenging roles in films such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285742/">Monster's Ball</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/">Brokeback Mountain</a>, and this coming summer's <a href="http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/">The Dark Knight</a>, was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/22/heath.ledger.dead/index.html?eref=rss_topstories">found dead in his apartment</a> with sleeping pills nearby, at the age of 28.  </p>

<p>Lauded personally as a "down-to-earth, generous, kindhearted, life-loving, unselfish individual", his death prompted remarks from such Hollywood heavyweights as Mel Gibson and Ang Lee, both of whom mourned the "tragic loss" of a young life.</p>

<p>On the same day as Ledger's death, 20-year-old Army Sergeant Michael R. Sturdivant of Conway, Arkansas died in Kirkuk, Iraq "<a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11636">of injuries sustained in a vehicle accident during convoy operations</a>".  Those who knew him praise his service-oriented attitude, dedication, and volunteerism.  His life was marked by a good heart and kind words.  Needless to say, Sturdivant's untimely and tragic death received <a href="http://www.legacy.com/saltlaketribune/gb/GuestbookView.aspx?PersonID=101811840">only local attention</a>.  </p>

<p>And why is this?  Is an actor's life worth more than a soldier's?  Is a tuxedo more prized than camouflage?  Many will unhesitatingly (although with some disgust) answer "Yes!", and it would seem that the evidence is on your side.  i answer "Yes" also, but not because i believe that one life or vocation is worth more than another.  i believe that Mr. Ledger's tragedy is so because it was UNEXPECTED.  The difference for Mr. Sturdivant is that  death is one of the accepted risks of his job.  Rarely mentioned or stated explicitly, to be killed is one of the things a soldier - and those who send him or her into battle - can EXPECT.

                              <p><strong>A rainy day book review: Writing Begins with the Breath.</strong><br />
 <br />
These rainy days are great for writing! I've already gone through four pieces of Rudi's Organic Apple 'n Spice bread (not as good as Farmer and the Cook apple walnut muffins but good enough to fuel the brain) and, in between checking the Ojai Post, am actually getting some work done!<br />
 <br />
I am a self-taught writer. Almost forty years have flown by, but I still recall the day I triumphantly placed my first newspaper column, thick with white-out, on the desk of Fred Volz, the grand editor of the Ojai Valley News. Through sheer desperation and force of will, in the midst of taking care of my two-year old son Bo,  I managed to turn my messy pages into a sparkling published masterpiece --or so it looked to me! <br />
 <br />
A few weeks ago I found a book sitting on a chair near my front porch. When I saw the title, "Writing Begins with the Breath," for me, a yogi-writer, it was love at first sight! I thought to myself, "Wow! Just what I need!"  Destiny dropped this book in my lap just in the nick of time, as I am about to embark on a very personal writing adventure.<br />

<p>The rain continues steadily, with a forecast for continued sky-water through <a href="http://www.accuweather.com/forecast.asp?partner=accuweather&traveler=1&zipcode=93023&metric=0">Saturday night (AccuWeather)</a> or <a href="http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/USCA0799?from=search_10day">Monday (Weather Channel)</a>.  Our local Police and Highway Patrol are reporting no road closures or major accidents, but there are many flooded areas which are mostly marked with cones and/or signs.  As always in the rain, simply be cautious and aware, reduce your speed, and increase your stopping distance.</p>

                              <p>Change whatever plans you have for Saturday night and head down to the Village Jester to hear live original music performed by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/azuresol">Azure Sol.</a><br />
<img src="http://www.ojaipost.com/images/azure sol/azure%20sol.jpg" width="363" height="500" alt="azure sol.jpg"/><br />
A couple of weeks ago, Bill and I ended up at the Jester for a late lunch (mmm, sweet potato fries).  While we were there, Azure Sol auditioned for Nigel.  The lead singer, Jessica Standley, has a beautiful voice - bluesy and soulful.  The band is sort of folksy with contemporary beats blended in.  They will be really fun to dance to.  I just enjoyed listening, not only because it's so nice to hear original music, but because their music has a contemplative quality, too. </p>

<p>To hear their single, "Imaginary Friend," tune into <a href="http://radioojai.com/2008/01/17/azure-sol-imaginary-friend.aspx">Radio Ojai</a>.  Sounds a bit like Indigo Girls' "Closer to Fine."</p>

<p>Happening in the Valley today and into the weekend: "<a href="http://www.ojaievents.com/event-detail.aspx?ID=2031">Bringing Up Baby</a>" at the Nan Tolbert  Nurturing Center in Oak View begins today (which i can personally vouch for as an excellent parenting/partnering/caregiving experience with real benefit to our community and planet), followed by <a href="http://www.ojaievents.com/">music, cooking, peace, and theater</a> tomorrow.  Saturday sees the <a href="http://www.ojaievents.com/event-detail.aspx?ID=756">22nd Annual Peddler's Fair</a>, free chiropractic, and tequila tasting.  Sunday is all about more eating, more drinking...and <a href="http://www.ojaievents.com/event-detail.aspx?ID=2043">supporting Democratic presidential candidate and Ojai visitor Dennis Kucinich</a>.</p>

"I have a special interest in this year's program. As a veteran of Dr. King's SCOPE project I registered "Negro" voters in rural Virginia in 1965-66. Through my association with King's organization, the SCLC, I met Deric Gilliard who lives in Atlanta and is a former Communications Director of the SCLC. By piecing together sponsors and speaking engagements at local schools, we (the Ojai Valley Youth Foundation and I) managed to entice him to come out here for a few days to share his first-hand knowledge of the Movement and many of the activists who embodied it."</em></p>

Admission is free. </p>

<p>Two of my favorite talents are in the production. My son Eli as Barney a friendly fellow with a flask who appears for a few moments at the beginning of the single-act, one hour tragedy. Local blues singer April Hendrix, my other favorite local talent, sways and sings in back-lit silhouette as the ghost of Bessie Smith. John Diehl brilliantly plays the irascible father of Alexis Poole, a young nurse whose starched white uniform contrasts beautifully with her pitch black soul.</p>

<p>Great dialog and a minimal, fabric-screen and wood frame set allow for a fun use of back-lighting and shadow play. Under the spirited direction of Scott Campbell, even the newest actors to the stage shine with star quality. Ivan Matip and Nachelle Sodetani both give outstanding stage-debut performances.</p>

                              <p>Hope Frazier died Saturday night at her home in Ojai. She was 60. Hope was diagnosed in April with an aggressive form of colon cancer. Even though I live only a few blocks from her house and walk past it regularly, I was not aware that she was struggling for her life.</p>

<p> I have many memories of Hope, who I met at a community gathering held at her house some years ago. I remember how she led me into her very funky art/writing studio  where she explained, among other things, that she didn't waste a single piece of paper. Every scrap had some creative recycled use. I remember purchasing a wall hanging made of rice paper with a photograph of Grandmother Oak, taken at sunset the day before the tree was taken down. Underneath the  image of Grandmother Oak was a poem called "Grandmother Oaks Last Pink Moment." <br />
(<em>After I first wrote this I learned that Hope's Grandmother Oak's Last Pink Moment monoprint, from a photograph made in Libbey Park, was the signature image of the Ojai Poetry Festival</em>)<br />

<p>This morning I felt inspired to visit Hope Frazier's website, a place that reflects Hope's magic and her love of the natural environment and all living things. I discovered so many things about her, that I know will inspire my own Life and creativity in the coming New Year. I hope you too will visit her site, if you have not done so already. <a href="http://www.HopeFrazier.com ">www.HopeFrazier.com </a></p>

<p>This morning friends of Hope received  the following e-mail message from her husband, Doug Adrianson, in which he shared some links to her obituaries. He wrote:</p>

<p> "Below are links to what is appearing today in the Miami Herald and Pasadena Star-News.  I'm sure the OVN will run something,  but not  until tomorrow. Please share these with the circle -- they may learn a few things about the old gal that they didn't know!"</p>

<p>Two recent articles in the Ojai Valley News and the Los Angeles Times highlight the ongoing problems created by massive numbers of  gravel trucks coming through the Ojai Valley.</p>

<p>The first is from the November 21st edition of the OVN by Nao Braverman in which she reports:</p>

<p>"Traffic threat from Santa Barbara County mines remains..."</p>

<p>"...Two new gravel mine expansion applications have Ojai Valley advocates concerned about an increase in truck traffic. Those community members are fighting to protect the quality of local air, noise and safety, particularly because the valleyâs tourist-based economy depends on itâ¦"</p>

On Thursday evening, December 6 I attended the <a href="http://jvaff.org">15th Annual Jules Verne Adventure Film Festival</a> at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.  On assignment for the Ojai Post, I joined my colleagues Michael Kelly and John Anthony Miller as they escorted renowned author Ray Bradbury to honored with the Jules Verne Lifetime Achievement Award.  He joined fellow honorees Ted Turner, Jean-Michel Cousteau, Tippi Hedren, Tony Curtis and Buzz Aldrin.  Patrick Stewart was president of the jury and Malcolm McDowell was the master of ceremonies.  It was a night to remember.  To explain how I joined such an esteemed company it is necessary to fill you in on the back-storyâ¦</p>

I'll assume they did some serious saging of the property. Tonight is the gala opening of their new play, Inspecting Carol.  Tickets are $50 per person. Performance begins at 8:00 p.m.  Check it out and support local theater.</p>

<p><u>Inspecting Carol</u><br />
A Christmas Carol meets The Government Inspector meets Noises Off in this hilarious alternative Christmas offering. A non-profit theater company rehearses A Christmas Carol, having dusted off this cash cow every season for nearly a generation. This year, though, their Dickensian money-maker will be thwarted by a stranger who might have the power to close their coffers for good. Everything goes wrong with their production, and hilarity is piled upon hilarity.</p>

<p>FARM presents âSPIRITED CHRISTMASâ CONCERT<br />
featuring JIMMY CALIRE and APRIL HENDRIX<br />
DECEMBER 8, 2007</p>

<p>Foundation of American Roots Music (FARM), the non-profit organization behind Ojaiâs famed Bowlful of Blues, will host a fundraising concert in the Ojai Art Center gallery on Saturday, December 8th beginning at 8 p.m. The evening, entitled âSpirited Christmas,â will feature the Jimmy Calire Quartet playing jazz arrangements of Christmas standards from his album of the same name followed by a holiday-themed blues dance with special guest vocalist April Hendrix.</p>

<p>FARM, under the direction of blues impresario Michael Kaufer, hopes to bring back the Bowlful of Blues in the fall of â08. The group also plans to reinstate its Roots Music-in-the-Schools programs that have reached many Ventura County children over the 20-plus years of the festivalâs history. All proceeds from the December 8 event will be applied toward those goals.</p>

<p>Holiday appetizers and an open bar will be available. Admission is $20 per person. Tickets are now on sale at Cardinali Brothers Music, 139 W. El Roblar Dr., Meiners Oaks; Ojai Creates, 606 E. Ojai Ave.;  and Ojai House, 304 N. Montgomery St., Ojai. Any remaining tickets will be available at the door. <br />
  <br />
Businesses are encouraged to reserve blocks of seats early for holiday staff parties by calling FARMâs information line at 646-7230. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.bowlfulofblues.com">www.bowlfulofblues.com</a>.</p>

<p> Bowlful of Blues staff and supporters invite the community to bring in the holiday season in a swinging fashion while helping FARM bring back Ojaiâs own Bowlful of Blues!<br />

<strong><em>10 Questions for the Dalai Lama</em></strong></p>

<p>Saturday, November 3rd , 8:00pm, Sacred Space Studio, 410 Bryant Circle Suite A</p>

<p>Why do the poor often seem happier than the rich? Must a society lose its traditions in order to move into the future? How do you reconcile a commitment to non-violence when faced with violence? These are some of the questions posed to his holiness the Dalai Lama by filmmaker and explorer Rick Ray. Ray examines in this documentary film some of the fundamental questions of our time by weaving together observations from his own journeys throughout India and the Middle East, and the wisdom of an extraordinary spiritual leader.</p>

This morning on Fox News, hosts of the show Fox and Friends blamed the wildfires in California on a new culprit: al Qaeda. They pointed to a <strong>2003 FBI memo</strong>, which raised the possibility that al Qaeda may try to set wildfires around the western United States. They also noted that men in a âhovering helicopterâ saw âa guy starting one of these fires.â<br />
Later in the segment, host Steve Doocy acknowledged that in memo, al Qaeda <strong>didnât even mention California</strong>. âThey mention Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming,â he added.  (emphasis mine)</p>

<p>This past weekend, we were privileged to attend the <a href="http://www.ojaifilmfestival.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ojai Film Festival</a>. We are producers of the movie <a href="http://www.agendathemovie.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AGENDA</a> featuring John Bennett Perry. This festival stands above all festivals we have ever attended. It is not only a splendid area for such an occasion but the residents of Ojai really raise the festival to a level that no other festival could possibly obtain.<br />
 <br />
Congratulations to Executive Director Laurie Kirby on her outstanding work as well as the supporting staff and festival Boards. Laurie is a great representative and did a superb job in the short time she has been in Ojai.<br />
 <br />
We look forward to visiting your area again. Once again congratulations Ojai!<br />

<p>"<em>WW II veterans</em>", the letter accompanying the DVD tells me, "<em>are dying at a rate of over 2,000 every day, and we feel it is very important to get their personal stories before they are lost to us forever.</em>"  This film is one of those stories, and will be playing next friday as part of the Ojai Film Festival.</p>

<p>now, i'm not an objective reviewer...so i think it's important to describe the lens through which i'm seeing this: i'm 27 turns around the sun, and my Pearl Harbor was the World Trade Center.  i'm also a peace activist and i believe as Benjamin Franklin did: that there never was a good war (or a bad peace).  the whole "just" or "necessary" war thing is frankly lost on me.  when i read the film's description, which describes the "incredible journey" of the 18-year-old Parker who enlisted to "serve his country and fight the forces of evil" and shares his "hope, fear, and unrelenting courage", i became cynically prepared for a Sousa-march-littered tale of romanticized war.  Twenty-eight minutes later, i was teary-eyed.</p>

<p>The Ojai Valley News reports that a potentially <a href="http://ojaivalleynews.blogspot.com/2007/09/man-arrested-on-assault-charge.html">gang-related vandalism and assault incident</a> took place on Tuesday on Santa Ana Road in Oak View, resulting in one arrest.</p>

<p>This comes on the heels of the Ojai Valley community's first major <a href="http://internationaldayofpeace.org/">International Peace Day</a> celebration, convened by the Retreats of Ojai, the Ojai Peace Coalition, and the Ojai Interfaith Alliance and titled "<a href="http://www.livingpeaceinojai.com">Living Peace in Ojai</a>".  The weekend-long event included the awarding of the first-ever <em>Noble Peace Prize</em> to <a href="http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2007/sep/20/couple-to-be-honored-at-peace-rally/">local activists Clive and Marion Leeman</a>, performance of the nation-traveling play "The Gift of Peace" which explores and urges support for the creation of a U.S. Department of Peace, and a well-attended and inspirational <a href="http://ojaivalleynews.blogspot.com/2007/09/ojai-joins-pursuit-of-peace.html">interspiritual gathering</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thepeacealliance.org/">The Peace Alliance</a>'s campaign to establish a Cabinet-level Department of Peace - which holds "<em>Effectively treat and dismantle gang psychology</em>" as one of its foundational efforts - is led by Ohio Congressman and <a href="http://www.dennis4president.com/home/">Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich</a>, who was <a href="http://ojaivalleynews.blogspot.com/2007/09/kucinichs-presidential-quest-runs.html">in Ojai over the weekend</a> for two appearances.  <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2007/09/dennis_and_elizabeth_kucinich.shtml">At the Ojai Retreat</a> on Sunday afternoon, Dennis outlined his philosophy of "Strength Through Peace" to over 100 local supporters.  Later that evening at the Glen Muse estate on Libbey Ave, a more informal gathering left many feeling uplifted and hopeful for the Kucinich's new post-election home.</p>

                              <p>Good morning, and happy IPD!  Keeping an eye on the weather, here's what's in store:</p>

<p><strong>6-7pm</strong>: Vigil for Peace under the Pergola in front of Libbey Park.  Consider wearing white.</p>

<p><strong>7pm</strong>: Opening ceremony for the Living Peace in Ojai weekend, taking place in the fountain area of Libbey Park.  Music will gather and focus us, Judy Gabriel of Meditation Mount will welcome us, and Rae Hanstad of the Ojai City Council will read the Peace Day proclamation that the City issued last week.  Then the Ojai Peace Coalition will present its first-ever Noble Peace Prize to Clive and Marion Leeman of the peace vigil!  A prayer of Peace and some candle-lit silence will transition us to...<br />
<strong><br />
8:15pm</strong>: free screening of "Peace One Day" taking place on the patio at Ojai House, 304 N Montgomery St.  It's about four blocks from the Park, so as long as you're dressed warmly you're welcome and encouraged to create a candle-lit procession to get there.  The film is 80 minutes long.</p>

For those of you also suffering under the latest Time/Warner Cable TV failure, I thought I would share the new excuse I just heard over the phone from one of their Service Center staffers, Natasha:</p>

<p>"It's all because of Global Warming!"</p>

<p>Given the magnitude of the problem, Natasha was unable to tell me when cable service would be restored.  I am calling the United Nations next for their estimate of when the problem will be rectified.</p>

<p>ps: If you want to get credit on your Time/Warner bill for days without service, you must call in and tell them, as Natasha instructed me, "The minute your service comes back on!"  --  Even if it's at 3:00 am.</p>

<p>About this time last year, Jessie and i were grumbling all the way to Vegas.  We were on our way to celebrate the combined birthdays of some dear friends with some college-style shenanigans, drinking, costumed theme nights, and general foolishness in a neon-lit adult playground in the desert, but we were ALSO missing Jack Johnson playing literally down the street from our home at Locally Grown 1.  So this year, with the bill of Perla Batalla and Brett Dennen to lure us, we had our <a href="http://brownpapertickets.com/">brown paper tickets</a> nice and early.  Vegas can wait (and it helps to have a newborn).</p>

<p>We arrived just in time to hear MC Claud Mann welcoming everyone, and Battle-of-the-Bands fourth place winners The Imaginative Clams took the stage as we found a good spot to sit in the elite (as designated by the colored bracelets and plastic chains) "Front Lawn" section.  i gazed sadly backward at the row of faces that made up the front of the "Back Lawn" section with the <a href="http://www.fivemanelectricalband.ca/signslyrics.html">Five Man Electrical Band's "Signs"</a> playing in my head over whatever Avant Garage or The Philosophy were sharing from the stage.  And then it happened: Emy Reynolds began to play.<br />

                              <p>Ojai Post readers, there's a whole lot more going on here than the Zaca fire!  We've got a big event this weekend, the <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2007/06/food_for_thought_brings_locall.shtml">Locally Grown Concert</a>, and it is being touted as a green event.</p>

<p>"Ojai's Libbey Bowl is going substantially greener for Food For Thought's benefit concert featuring Perla Batalla and Brett Dennen," announced event coordinator, Marty Fujita. </p>

<p>The event, Locally Grown 2, which features not only Batalla and Dennen, but the winners of the August 4th Ojai -Ventura youth <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2007/08/food_for_thought_announces_bat.shtml">Battle of the Bands </a>competition, will benefit Food for Thought's farm-to-school program which educates children about healthy food choices and the importance of good environmental stewardship. Food For Thought's programs are in six of the seven schools of the Ojai Unified School District. The program also works with OUSD Food Service to introduce as much fresh, locally grown, seasonal produce into school meals as possible. </p>

<p>"We want this event not only to raise money for our program, but to be a model for how we can do large events, and keep our carbon footprint as small as possible. We may not be 100% green for this event, but we will be reaching for that standard," added Fujita.</p>

                              <p>I thought it would be nice to take a break from reality and listen to some local music.</p>

<p>Ojai's rock band, <a href="http://www.Myridian.net">Myridian</a>, is back in Ojai this Friday 8/24 at 6pm at the Ojai Athletic Club and again next Friday 8/31 at the Deer Lodge at 9pm.  I asked Scott Smith, the band's keyboardist, what they are looking forward to most with the Deer Lodge gig, and he said, "It's one of the few regular venues for a full rock band in Ojai, so weâre glad to be coming home after being on the road down in San Diego."  Myridian recently performed for the troops at Camp Pendleton.</p>

<p>They've always stayed true to their original music, but plan to surprise fans with some familiar sounds next week, "Weâve worked up a few covers for the Rolling Stones, Beatles, and Steely Dan fans, and Lady Sheila, our groovinâ bass goddess will be with us!"  </p>

<p>Since summer is just about over, and I would like it to linger on, I thought we should take a listen to the first track on their CD, Prime Myridian, aptly named, "Summer of My Mind."  Tune in at <a href="http://radioojai.com/2007/08/20/myridian-is-back-in-ojai-for-2-nights.aspx">Radio Ojai</a>.</p>

Food For Thought's Battle of the Bands for youth in Ojai and Ventura took place last weekend and resulted in the selection of four stand-outs who will open the Locally Grown fundraising concert on August 25 at Libbey Bowl. Following the winning openers will be featured headliners <a href="http://www.myspace.com/brettdennen">Brett Dennen</a> - currently touring with John Mayer - and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/perlabatalla">Perla Batalla </a>- Grammy nominated vocalist and Ojai resident. The event is a fundraiser for Food For Thought Ojai, a nonprofit organization that brings nutrition education, garden-based learning and environmental and agricultural awareness to students of Ojai's public schools. The first Locally Grown concert in 2005 featured singer/songwriter Jack Johnson.

The weekend of September 21-23 is a major opportunity to celebrate Peace in a public and audio/visual way that directly builds a culture of peace...it is a time to be the change we wish to see.  Please consider how you can help locally.</em></p>

<p>We have some major opportunities for building a local culture of Peace coming up, and the main purpose of this post is to solicit volunteers for a variety of roles within that effort.  September 21st is <a href="http://www.internationaldayofpeace.org">International Peace Day</a>, and the Peace Alliance â the folks behind the <a href="http://www.thepeacealliance.org/">campaign for a federal Department of Peace</a> â will be coming to Ojai on that weekend to perform their play âThe Gift of Peaceâ at our own Libbey Bowl.  There will also be an Interfaith peace-focused schedule of ceremony, prayer, and music on Sunday the 23rd.  The collective Retreats of Ojai are on board with this in a big way and are organizing events during the entire Peace Weekend, and the Ojai Peace Coalition is going to be a part of it!</p>

                              <p>Local writer and massage therapist <strong>Cynthia Waring Matthews</strong> tells her triumphant story. Based on her book, <em>Bodies Unbound</em>, tonight's performance features Cynthia in a one-woman theatre piece directed by <strong>Jill Andre. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Cynthia Waring Matthews</strong> first escaped the sorrow of her early days by retreating to a convent as a young woman. Emerging after a time to re-enter the world at large, she was looking for an occupation and found herself absorbed into the world of bodywork, where she became a licensed massage therapist and massaged over 20,000 people in 30 years, from the anonymous to the dazzlingly famous, from infants to the elderly, from those seeking healing to those seeking a bodily indulgence. In her practice, she made a unique discovery: That through her fingers, she was able to read bodies and into the histories of the people beneath her hands. She could unlock the experiences and traumas stored in their bodies through cellular memories. </p>

I wanted to get a chance to share with anyone who hasn't heard yet, that the Shakespeare festival is back in Ojai, at the Libbey Bowl this coming weekend, Thurs, Fri, Sat, and Sunday nights at 7:30pm.  </p>

<p>I've been running sound for the performances with my studio assistant, Kazdyn Nicholson, and this year's performance of Midsummer Night's Dream is delightful, and hilarious!</p>

<p>Please help out the Ojai Shakespeare festival by coming out to see a performance, you will not be disappointed.  Click on the extended entry for my review of this year's show.   Thanks much!  </p>

                              <p>The new owners of The Ojai Playhouse, Kathy and Mark Hartley, are also owners of Lavender Inn.  I've known Kathy for about two years, and have found her to be one of the most genuine, community-minded people I know.  She opens her doors for a variety of activities, from cooking classes, free computer consulting I participate in, weekly business lunches, philanthropic endeavors and more.   Their son, Jamie, is a recent business graduate of CSU Northridge, and will run the Playhouse day-to-day.</p>

<p>Glenn Emanuel's remembrance ceremony was yesterday at the gazebo in Libbey Park.  When i arrived at a few minutes before 4pm, there were but a handful of people gathered, most of whom were busily setting up easels of pictures and arranging chairs and sound equipment.  within minutes, the gathering swelled to a strong crowd that read like a who's-who of the Ojai Valley...i saw Sid and Sheila Cohn, the Al-Awars, Jim Calire, John Azevedo, Noel Douglas, Peggy La Cerra, and dozens of other very familiar faces that i personally dont even have names for.</p>

<p>we opened with music and prayer, and <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2007/07/in_remembrance_of_glenn_emmanu.shtml">elegant and heartfelt stories and reflections</a> were shared by friends and family.  as seems to be so often the case with those who leave us, these served to describe a person whom it feels beautiful to remember, but - as my wife observed as we solemnly left - whom we wish we'd known better while he was here.  it's clear that Glenn loved us all, and that we all loved him no matter how large or small our piece of his experience.</p>

<p>i believe that Cheri Mason-Emanuel's son said it best when he introspected that Glenn never seemed sad...always happy.  and so it hardly feels appropriate to be sad that he's gone; we can only be happy that he was here.  </p>

<p>"<em>Glenn was here</em>", etched with care into the picnic tables of our minds and hearts.  Ojai - and the world - are better for it.</p>

                              <p>This post is all over the place, but it's been a typical week in Ojai where I run into all sorts of interesting people and great food.  I found the perfect sandwich, enjoyed a great evening of side-splitting laughter and met an inspiring and courageous woman - all right here in our little valley.</p>

<p><strong>Dishing Ojai: Oak Tree CafÃ© and Bakery:</strong><br />
I have finally found the perfect sandwich in Ojai at the Oak Tree CafÃ© and Bakery at the corner of Fox and Ojai Avenue.  I had the broiled open-faced tomato and mozzarella sandwich with olive tapenade spread and Bill had the albacore tuna salad sandwich with pesto spread (he threatened to order it "Mikeâs Way," but I stopped him).  Both were accompanied by a terrific salad tossed with shredded carrots, parmesan, tomatoes, their homemade croutons (which they sell by the bag) and choice of honey lemon or balsamic vinaigrette.  We sat outside under a shady pepper tree sipping sun-brewed iced tea and devoured every bite.  Oak Tree started as a small bakery and coffee stop down on Hwy. 33 in a converted ATM drive-thru selling the most amazing pastries.  They still have the pastries, but youâve got to get there early to enjoy them.</p>

                              <p>Jessie and i walked down to the Ojai Playhouse last night (so grateful we live close enough to do that!), arriving a few minutes after 5:30 to deposit our $40 - two 20's marked with PEACE, LOVE, & HEALTH - into the full fishbowl of medical fund collections for Glenn Emmanuel.  Music was already floating out of the propped-open auditorium doors, where <a href="http://www.householdgods.com">The Household Gods</a> had already begun their benefit set with a beautifully-lyric'd song that i missed the  title of.</p>

<p>There were maybe 50 people in the theater - sitting in small groups or alone - of all ages, and all seemed to be enjoying the music by nodding, clapping, or singing along with the Gods' master-full set, punctuated by instrument-switching and playful banter between songs.  If you've never heard the Gods (this was my second time), you're missing an exceptional piece of cultural Ojai and uniquely arranged covers of songs you know and love, as well as exposure to new favorites you didn't know you had.</p>

                              <p>i gladly accepted the generous <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2007/06/magick_summer_in_mother_moon.shtml">invitation of Millennium and Megumi</a> to be with them at the Ojai Playhouseâs first screening of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_%28film%29">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a>, the fifth in the seven part super-series.  we got there early enough to enjoy the antics and energy of the thicket of teenagers and preteens in front of us as the theater filled quickly behind us.  after only one preview (for the fresh-, funny-, and clever-looking âFred Clausâ), our adventure began.<br />
 <br />
iâm not going to review the film in great detail.  iâm not going to summarize the story, or play the cynical judge (too much). but i do have some insights about the appeal:<br />
i believe that it lies in the globality of it.  much like a national protest or vigil, or a global moment of silence or large-scale tragedy or the Olympics, thereâs something powerful and attractive about sharing an experience â any experience â with millions of other people all over our planet.  not only were we all and each immersed in the energy of a full theater where we have the comfortable space to laugh, cry, sigh, and scream as one, but there are people all over the globe doing the same thing.  i think we like that, even if we donât all take the time to specifically think about it.</p>

<p><strong>Battle of the Bands deadline extended to 7/20!</strong><br />
As you already know from the press releases I have placed on these pages, Food For Thought is sponsoring a local Battle of the Bands for youth in Ojai and Ventura. The three winning bands will open the <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2007/06/food_for_thought_brings_locall.shtml">Locally Grown fundraising concert </a>on August 25 at Libbey Bowl featuring headliners <a href="http://www.myspace.com/brettdennen">Brett Dennen</a> - currently touring with John Mayer - and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/perlabatalla">Perla Batalla</a> â Grammy nominated vocalist and Ojai resident. The event will be the second Locally Grown fundraiser for Food For Thought Ojai; the first concert in 2005 featured singer/songwriter Jack Johnson.</p>

<p>The Battle of the Bands is open to youth ages 13-20 from Ojai and Ventura, and will take place August 4th and 5th at the Matilija Junior High School Auditorium from 10am â 5pm. Bands performing all varieties of music, from straight edge and punk to jazz and acoustic, are encouraged to enter. In addition to opening the Locally Grown 2 concert, the three winning bands will also be able to record their chosen song in a professional sound studio and receive free CD copies of the recording.</p>

<p>Entry forms and a sample recording must be submitted by July 20. Rules and other information can be found on the <a href="http://www.foodforthoughtojai.org/">Food For Thought Ojai Web site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New Content on Radio Ojai</strong><br />
Speaking of Food for Thought, at last weekendâs screening of <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2007/06/farmer_john_brings_the_real_di.shtml">The Real Dirt on Farmer John</a>, Lesley Littlefield performed her song, âOranginess,â which you can now listen to on <a href="http://www.RadioOjai.com">Radio Ojai</a>.</p>

<em>From a press release submitted by <a href="http://www.foodforthoughtojai.org/" rel="nofollow">Food for Thought Ojai</a>:</em></p>

<p>No, itâs not about the sausage company.</p>

<p><em>The Real Dirt on Farmer John</em> is a movie about Illinois farmer John Petersen and his decades-long struggle to wrest right livelihood from his familyâs farm. Winner of over 30 festival awards, this film has it all â life, death, sex, terrorism, art, failure, success. Helped along by the fact that his mom started taking 16 mm movies of the family when John was a child, and by the fact that John is an artist as well as a bred-in-the-bones farmer, this movie reaches far beyond any normal expectations of a documentary about a mid-western farmer.</p>

<p>Presented by Food for Thought Ojai, the Ojai Film Society, and Slow Food Ojai/Ventura. <em>The Real Dirt on Farmer John </em>will show Saturday and Sunday, June 30-July 1, at 4:30 pm at the Ojai Playhouse in downtown Ojai. Tickets are $8 for adults, and $5 for seniors and students at the door.</p>

<p>Farmer John Petersen will be at BOTH screenings for Q &amp; A.</p>

<p>June 1 was the 40th anniversary of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967).</p>

<p>When I first heard Sgt.Pepper's by the Beatles it was one of those albums that jump started my inspiration and interest in music. The orchestral arrangements, sound scapes and phenomenal melodies (not to mention the cool outfits of the Fab four) kept me transfixed. I must have listened to it at least 2-3 times a day for months. Few things in life have this kind of impact on us. This was one for me.</p>

<p><strong>What event or... captivated and inspired you as a child?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here's great article about the making of :</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.riprense.com/sgtpepper.htm">http://www.riprense.com/sgtpepper.htm</a></strong></p>

<p>It begins:   Many critics, I think, have forgotten that âPepperâ was a kind of pinnacle of genre, a new sort of music that had never exactly existed before. You no more dismiss its importance and achievement than you dismiss Beethovenâs Ninth Symphony because itâs 19th century orchestral music. Continuing that analogy, you donât evaluate the Ninth Symphony as a collection of movements that have no particular relationship to one another, and you do not evaluate âSgt. Pepperâ as a bunch of songs that happened to appear together on a vinyl disc. This album is a piece. Though not conceived as a whole, it was executed as one---the product of a single gigantic and intense series of recording sessions. It also bears remembering that there were no hits from âPepper,â no singles. The whole damn thing was a hit, and the biggest of its time, if not all time. In the summer of 1967, in many cities, you could not walk the length of a block without leaving earshot of this record. Humanityâs collective jaw was agape, its ears full of iridescent, irresistable sounds of a kind it had never heard before. </p>

Myridian, an Ojai-based fivesome of forty-somethings, proved earlier this year that itâs never too late to start rocking with the release of their first album, Prime Myridian. Working blue-collar day jobs as an electrician, farmer, equipment renter, pool technician and electronics installer, Myridianâs roster includes Scott Smith on keyboards, Richard Metcalfe on guitar, Kalvin Keller on lead vocals, Patrick Duffy on drums and Bud McCanless on bass. </p>

<p>he told me this himself, when i saw him recently at Rainbow Bridge.  it was the first thing he said, and he did it with a slight smile on his face.  not that it isnt serious, but i strongly suspect that Glenn's got a specific and philosophical constitution that isnt very friendly to depression or sympathy-gathering.  i'm told by his partner Cheri Mason that Glen has chosen to forego the traditional toxic therapies for cancer, and is instead focusing on "nutrition, yoga, magnets, and herbs", and in honorable form is treating his cancer in the same way he treats others and the world: peacefullly, with life-affirming practices and natural cures.</p>

<p><strong><em>come meet the man and enjoy some great music at a donation-driven benefit for him this Friday evening May 25th at the Ojai Playhouse at 10pm, featuring Jim Calire and friends, Brad Bueley, Julie Christensen, and more.</em></strong>  interested musicians are encouraged to <a href="mailto:cheriamor@sbcglobal.net">contact Cheri</a>.  there is also an account set up in Glenn's name at Ojai Community Bank.</p>

<p><strong>"Paper Tiger, Toothless Dragon"</strong><br />
 <br />
<strong>Contrary to recent press stories, there is NO deal in place between Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties regarding the ban of gravel truck traffic on Route 33 from the proposed Diamond Rock Mine in the Cuyama Valley and Ojai.</strong></p>

<p>This alleged deal is nothing more than an attempt to undercut our opposition.  What they seek to do is an example of the classic political maneuvers of the  âThree Dâs:â  âDelay,â âDistractâ and/or âDeny.â  Do not be misled!</p>

<p>They seek to pull attention away from their latest (and substandard) EIR of May 2007 which we will not even dignify by calling it a âFinal EIR.â  There are logical holes in this EIR that a blind man could drive a fleet of gravel trucks through at night.  </p>

<p>But more dangerously, the CUP that they dangle in front of us contains no verification of  truck traffic.  It is a âPaper Tiger, a Toothless Dragon.â</p>

<p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, âDo not pass any laws you can not enforce because it only breeds disrespect for the law.â</p>

<p>Allowing self-monitoring of truck loads and drivers has already proven to be a disaster in Ventura County where a total failure of our own Planning Department to create CUPâs in 2001 and 2003 that have any verification or  enforcement  has left us with the 24/7 nightmare we now experience.   </p>

<p>Do not be misled.  There is no deal.  The only way we will win this war is with your total support and dedication.</p>

I have been able to avoid caring about Sports for a long time now, but it's <a href="http://www.nba.com/playoffs2007/index.html"target="_blank">NBA Playoff Season</a>, and the games are Live in my living room. And when something comes this close, you have almost no choice but to allow a relationship to develop. The trick is to start to learn the details. Understanding the strengths of the individual players' games, knowing the strategies and preferences of the different coaches, and getting the scoop on the team's management turns Basketball into a dramatic and entertaining piece of theatre.</p>

<p>Yet I am noticing that it is much easier to be interested and engaged when you have a favorite player, coach or team. Otherwise there is no emotional juice to draw you towards it. Trying to stay an intellectual observer is too boring and does not imprint the experience in the mind. But as soon as you allow yourself preferences, the experience becomes personal and relevant and you literally See the Game differently.</p>

<p>Robert has a calm, focused and direct stage presence that captivated the standing room only crowd. I was thrilled to see so many people come out for poetry on a Tuesday night! And thrilled to be out on a Tuesday night since I'm usually at home with my family.</p>

<p>Robert read a bunch of poems ranging from a euology to poet, Stanford Lyne, to poems about the loss of his young son, to childhood memories growing up in the border town of El Centro, California, to a couple of his own translations of Neruda and Machado (brilliant!). To top it off he ended the night with some hilarious poems about a carrot and a turnip and their vegetable cohorts. Hope to see more of that series in readings to come.</p>

<p>Robert, maybe you could post a poem or two ?</p>

                              <p>Turn On. Tune In. Drop Out!<br />
I got a little jolt last night as I sat in Upavistha Konasana (Seated Wide Angle Pose) watching the PBS documentary on Hippies and the Summer of Love. It dawned on me that it was 40 years ago (1967)  that I took the Greyhound bus from Ventura to San Francisco and rented a room on the third story of a house on the Haight. For the first time in my life I was free to draw around the clock with Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkle in the background. I could sit for hours on the window ledge, in my painted jeans, watching the unfolding hippy invasion below. From my third story perch I could spot Janis Joplin in the crowd and hear Country Joe and the Fish playing nearby. Imagine growing up in Ojai and suddenly finding yourself transported  amongst 20,000 people dancing in Golden Gate Park! The documentary showed  the Human Be-In, a Gathering of the Tribes, and all the great counterculture gurus.  I remembered how I made money selling my art, babysitting the four poor children who lived in the basement below, and peddling the Berkeley Barb. You could buy a ten pound bag of brown-rice for $1 and get clothes at the Free Store. I don't remember ever eating the Free Food. When I ran out of rice I fasted to protest the Vietnam War. My AWOL boyfriend was picked up by the military police in the dead of night and locked up in the Presidio.  Did anyone else see the PBS special last night? Did you see yourself?  As I stretched forward in Upavisthakonasana I had this great cosmic insight that we're all still trying to turn on, tune in and drop out... Is that what growing older is all about?</p>

                              <p>Hope you are enjoying your gloomy Saturday in Ojai... There is a nice article in Canadian publication The Star Phoenix on the <a href="http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/weekend_extra/story.html?id=39c6263f-5db9-4958-9061-df82b9c104c5">Ojai Valley Inn & Spa</a>.  Money quote:</p>

<blockquote>With a 360-degree view of the dramatic mountain range, the 89-hectare Spanish colonial- style resort is nestled snugly within the valley.  The air is noticeably fresh -- if not sweet -- compared to L.A. several hundred metres below.

<p>With complimentary valet service, we leave our car behind and forget it exists until check-out two days later. The attention to detail is beyond expectation -- especially after having just disembarked an Air Canada flight where the menu selection is no longer chicken or beef, but water or orange juice, with the option to buy an overpriced, nearly naked, six-inch Subway sub.</blockquote></p>

<p>Get it?  <strong>Ojai is a place that people come to <em>from around the world</em> to get away from Subway.</strong>  By preventing the urgent moratorium and allowing the Subway franchisee to file for the necessary permits, Joe DeVito has single-handedly torpedoed the very perception of what Ojai is.</p>

<p>It's spring break.  Easter week.  And Passover.  I'm going to visit my family in Chicago but I feel like I should stay in Ojai and make  dent in the pile of work ahead of me.  I hate it when I leave the valley and can't wait to get back.  I"m already anxious for my plane to land next Wednesday.  Then I can go full-force in being obnoxiously over-exposed.  Here's what's happening.  If anyone sees anything interesting to take part in, please do contact me:<br />

<p>Although most people are terrified of change, there is no greater recipe for failure than inertia, doing things as they have always been done.  </p>

<p>Ellison S. Onizuka, one of our astronauts whose death in the 1987 crash of the  space shuttle Challenger illustrated the danger of risk taking, said it best in a speech he gave to students few years earlier.</p>

<p>âThe people who make this world run, whose lives can be termed successful, whose names will go down in history books, are not the cynics, the critics, or the armchair quarterbacks.  They are the adventurers, the explorers, and the doers of this world.  When they see a wrong or a problem, they do something about it...  Rather than leaning back and criticizing how things are, they work to make things the way they should be.  They are the aggressive, the self-starters, the innovative, and the imaginative of this worldâ¦.  â   <br />

                              <p>I recently had the pleasure of meeting Fred Schmitt, a prolific singer/songwriter and a musical genius, who lives right here in our little valley.  He's the real deal.  He's been writing music for 35 years and has traveled some million miles over 46 states playing to anyone who would listen.  He has written over 200 songs and finds it hard to keep the muse at bay.  And he doesn't have a recording contract.  Incredible.</p>

<p>I chatted him up over coffee this afternoon at Stir Crazy with my friend Matt and turned the mics on to capture a couple of his songs, too.  The interview and the music are on Radio Ojai.  <a href="http://radioojai.com/">Take a listen</a> - I think you'll feel like I do...like I've just gotten a sneak peak of someone on the verge of great success.  Any second now, he'll be in Nashville.</p>

a bright sliver of the moon hangs over<br />
the dark shadowy mountains of the <br />
valley of the moon<br />
i stand stone still <br />
watching the first glimmers of dawn<br />
the quarter moon so bright it <br />
almost looks full<br />
the valley below so silent<br />
like the beginning of time<br />
no busy minds...no cars...<br />
only the soft soft hooting of the owl</p>

<p>Elsewhere, a little Ojai Post administrative housekeeping - the list of <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/ojai-authors.shtml">Ojai Post authors</a> is now on its own page and won't be listed in the right column of the site.  We're just growing too darn big!  Also, welcome to our two latest authors: <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/suza.shtml">Suza Francina</a>, author, yoga instructor and former mayor of Ojai, and <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/kira.shtml">Kira Ryder</a>, owner of Lulu Bandha's Yoga.   </p>

<p>And if you are up for it, head on out to SOHO in Santa Barbara this evening for a night of music featuring <a href="http://www.janedoes.com/tour.shtml">The Jane Doe's</a>, sexy, sultry blue-eyed soul.  They're good friends of mine, but don't hold it against them.</p>

<blockquote>The Ojai Post is a community blog, featuring Ojai residents from all walks of life writing about the unique Ojai experience. Ojai is a special place, not just for its geography, flora and fauna, small-town architecture and rich native American history - its also because of the people - talented, creative souls who tend to walk to the beat of their own drummer and carve their own path through life. Check in for daily musings, rants, Ojai news and greater goings-on from the place some call Shangri-La.</blockquote>

<p>We've certainly had our share of musings, rants, news and greater goings-on - 425 posts and counting.  And we're just getting started.  My deep gratitude to twenty-two authors who have dipped in a toe or taken the plunge, and to our ever-increasing audience (over 1,500 visitors and 5,000 page views yesterday).   The Ojai Post is about community, one I'm proud to be a part of.   Hope you're enjoying the ride as much as I am.</p>

<p>I want to personally thank the hundreds of concerned citizens of the region who took the time to write letters to Gary Kaiser.  They have already had an impact!</p>

<p>According to a news story in the Pacific Coast Business Times, a final draft of the EIR will be completed by the end of the month.  Your letters will be included according to a conversation I've had with Gary Kaiser.  The Santa Barbara County Planning Comission will review and decide on the merits of the EIR at their April Meeting.  If approved there are a number of other, smaller regulatory issues that must be dealt with.  If everything passes approval, the whole issue is expected to go to the Santa Barbara County Supervisors in late summer or the fall.</p>

<p>Our "Stop the Trucks" committee, which has so far been an infomal collection of concerned citizens, will be meeting at the end of February for an open "brainstorming" meeting. <br />

Well, I didn't think there would be much worth mentioning except the fact that the little rodent would go back into his den and give us 6 more weeks of winter (although you wouldn't know it on a day like today).  But it was a little more exciting than that.  I had a face-to-face interview with Al Gore on the red carpet at his screening of <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.  Playing reporter was very different than the role I played as <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2007/01/the_price_of_paradise_screens.shtml">filmmaker</a> earlier in the week, but thrilling given who was answering my question.  Tune in for more after I decipher my notes!  Meanwhile, read evan's previous post about the movie <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2006/06/an_inconvenient_truth.shtml">here</a>.<br />

" style="float: right; border: 0px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" border="0" /></a>This year's annual Erotic Poetry & Spoken Word reading at the <a href="http://www.venturaartistsunion.org/" target="_blank">Artist's Union Gallery</a> in Ventura will be held on Saturday, Feb. 10th at 7:00 pm. This reading celebrates the erotic in the broadest sense - works that evoke yearning, longing, and loss, as well as the more traditional praises of desire and tributes to the beloved - and commemorates the opening of the Artistsâ Union Gallery's annual erotic art exhibition.</p>

<p>âEroticism,â says event-host Friday, âis most easily found in food, poetry, art and sex; three of the four items mentioned will be provided for you at the benefit.â  The line-up includes <a href="http://web.mac.com/r.w.b/iWeb/Site/Playa%20Poets%20Home.html" target="_blank">Richard Beban</a>, author of <i>What the Heart Weighs</i>, Bay Area author Adrienne Marcus, poet/publisher <a href="http://www.solopress.org/Solo%20Press%20Web/Glenna%20Luschei.html" target="_blank">Glenna Luschei</a>, and many others.  âWe are so lucky to have such an incredible assemblage of talent under the same roof.  We expect to hear poems from ardent to zany, and everything in-between.  All that energy should make for an intense reading,â says co-organizer Phil Taggart.</p>

<p>âAccording to Hesiod, Eros instills all notions of beauty and anguish within our souls,â says co-organizer and award-winning poet, Marsha de la O.  âBoth beauty and anguish are principal considerations of poetry.  We wanted to give a distinguished group of Southern Californian poets the opportunity to explore the nuances of eroticism in an environment where visual artists and sculptors have used other media to explore the same concept.â</p>

<p>Admission is $10 at the door.  The event is a benefit with all proceeds going to the Artistsâ Union Gallery.  The Artistsâ Union Gallery is located at 330 South California Street in Ventura.</p>

<p>Poets reading include: Joyce LaMers, Jackson Wheeler, Tim Tipton, Roe Estep, Shelley Savren, Elijah Imlay, Ryan Gillenwater, Richard Beban, Howard Billou, Carol Davis, Carlye Archibeque, Ellen Reich, Florence Weinberger, Adrianne Marcus, Doris Vernon, Glenna Luschei, Perie Longo, Virginia Mariposa, Robert Peake, Teka Lark-Lo, Laura Diamond, Mary Kay Rummel, Lee Rossi, Tim Pompey, Cathryn Andreson, Larry Colker, Patricia Lynn Belkovitz, Bob Sterling, Marsha de la O, Friday and Phil Taggart.<br />

<p>There has been a lot of talk on these pages about affordable housing.  What does that mean to you?  Who should have it?  What should it look like?  Where should it be built?  The documentary, <em>The Price of Paradise</em>, does not seek to answer these questions, but rather engage a dialog.</p>

<p>When our family moved to the United States in 1974, we stopped in Israel and 
  Jordan to visit some of the holy places. I remember visiting the wailing wall, 
  calvary, and the location of Christ's tomb. Though I was only 7, it left an 
  impression on me. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_nixon">Richard 
  Nixon</a> resigned a month after our arrival. I have vague memories of these 
  times but I can honestly say the first President I really remember is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_carter">Jimmy 
  Carter</a>. Carter has been a hero of mine for many years because of his honesty, 
  integrity, and his work for peace. In particular, the <a href="http://www.cartercenter.org/">Carter 
  Center</a>, founded by Carter, has the goal for advancing human rights and alleviating 
  suffering. Recently I read his new book <em><a href="http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&pid=522298">Palestine 
  Peace Not Apartheid</a></em> with great interest. I was curious to see what 
  this prominent Nobel Peace Prize winner had to say about the Middle East, especially 
  in using the word '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid">apartheid</a>' 
  in the title. </p>

A few examples from HuffPo:</p>

<p><em>Act honorably or be held accountable.<br />
I'm the Person of the Year.<br />
We are all in this together<br />
Seek peace. Give love. Bring joy.</em></p>

<p>So The Ojai Post is opening up the comments to six word entries with this theme:  "Ojai 2006 in Six Words."  Might I offer a handful:</p>

<p><em>Hot in February, hotter in July<br />
Joe in, David out, Olsen back<br />
Farewell Frostie - miss your turkey burgers<br />
Cathy Jones doesn't recognize Bruce Norris</em><br />

                              <p>My most recent post about poetry in this area was met with a spontaneous flurry of poems in the comment section. As a result, and at Tyler's prompting, I thought it might be fun to invite readers of The Ojai Post to submit Haiku. To submit a poem or read others already submitted, simply click the comment link right underneath this article. If you already know what Haiku is all about, you can skip down there now to read and write some Haiku.</p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with the form, English Haiku is loosely based on the Japanese form from which it gets the name. In English Haiku, the only constraint is that each line have a certain number of syllables. It is actually quite easy: the first line must have five syllables, the second line seven, and the third line five again. That's it. Three lines, twelve syllables total.</p>

<p>Traditional Japanese Haiku usually sprung from deep observation of nature. Often the first two lines are meditative and descriptive, and the third and final line of a Haiku presents some element of surprise or revelation, or perhaps a new angle on the subject. This is not always the case, but works well to delight the reader and hopefully leave them with a lasting impression. Here is probably the most famous of all Haiku by a seventeenth century poet named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsuo_Basho">BashÅ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The old pond<br />
frog jumps in -<br />
water's sound.</blockquote>

<p>(Note: because this was translated from Japanese, the English version does not conform to the 5, 7, and 5 syllables rule. But it gives you a flavor of traditional Haiku.)</p>

<p>If you are interested, you can read more about the Haiku form <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">here</a>.</p>

The evenings start at 7:30 PM. On alternate weeks, they also feature a poet or two to read at length. On January 16th, for example, they will feature the outstanding double-header of <a href="http://www.cac.ca.gov/243/">California State Poet Laureate</a> <a href="http://www.alyoung.org/">Al Young</a> and preeminent local poet and publisher <a href="http://www.solopress.org/Solo%20Press%20Web/Glenna%20Luschei%20Blog/Glenna%20Luschei%20Blog.html">Glenna Luschei</a>. Coffee and cookies were provided during the break tonight, with plenty of interesting conversation and unique pieces of modern art to peruse throughout the gallery. Come to read or just to listen, and leave, as I did, a little more full and happy.</p>

<p>Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, "Gravity's Rainbow," is still so frenetic, paranoid, preternaturally sharp, abrupt in its changes of subject and tone and relentless in its probing of the sinister connections among sex, high-tech polymers and the Blitz that a person would have to be slightly off to think he understands it enough to illustrate it.</p>

<p>Yet Zak Smith, with uninhibited bravado and exactly the right kind of insanity, has done something remarkable in "Gravity's Rainbow Illustrated": created a series of images that approach the richness of their source. He draws a lurid and intoxicating netherworld, complete in its own right and, at the same time, an illuminating companion to the novel. Since all editions of "Gravity's Rainbow" seem to be printed from the same plates, each one of Smith's illustrations will correspond to one page of the foxed copy you've been trucking around since college. </p>

<p>We were mentioned in the <a href="http://www.vcreporter.com/article.php?id=3997&IssueNum=98" target"_blank">VC Reporter this week</a>, but let me add that Cuppa Joe was first proposed by Todd Miller and championed by evan austin and a number of our readers.  It's a great idea.  See you there, hope you can make it.</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE: 6:47pm] </strong>Thanks to all fifteen individuals for coming on down to Stir Crazy and participating in the very first, but not last, Cuppa Joe.  It was great to see a bunch of familiar faces, meet a few new people and exchange some dialogue.  Consider this an open thread on the event and how you'd like to see it evolve.</p>

As far as I know, only one - and they meet the third Thursday of the month at Zoey's cafe on Main Street in Ventura. Sometimes student-centered open mics get a bad rap for laborious rough-draft poetry and undergraduate antics. Not this place. Tonight featured two top-notch local poets and a brief line up of quality open mic readers. </p>

<p><a href="http://academic.venturacollege.edu/galley/">Gwendolyn Alley</a> hosts the series and teaches the class, and thanks to her broad interests and teacherly charm, she gives the evening a casual, positive feel while promoting everything from slam to language poetry to narrative free verse. Literally, there's something for everyone here. If you want to hear some local talent (emphasis on the talent) or read some of your own work as well, be sure to check out Zoey's on the third Thursday of every month starting at 7:30 PM.</p>

                              <p>The Men of Ojai Calendar goes to print tomorrow.  About a dozen stores will be carrying the calendar in Ojai and Ventura, so there's a good chance we can sell all 2,000. But we can could use more community support with presales.  Remember, everyone who preorders a calendar will be entered into a drawing.  The winner will choose a copy of the 16x23 photo of their choice.  Those of you have seen them know that these photographs are  stunning.  So please go to www.majiquephoto.com to buy your 'Men of Ojai 2007 Calendar, The Fine Art Photography of Attasalina Dews.'  These first proceeds will go directly to printing costs.  </p>

A brief introduction: you probably haven't seen me around too much, though I've lived here for a couple of years. I tend to keep to myself. That said, I love community and this one in particular. And I love poetry. So please join me as I seek to uncover goings on in this area related to literature, writing, and the arts. So far the process has been a lot like flipping over stones after a rain and finding all sorts of interesting things wriggling underneath them.

<p>Here's one big stone: probably the best resource for poetry events in this area, and <a href="javascript:if(window.external) {window.external.AddFavorite('http://www.poetix.net/ventura.htm','Poetix.Net');}else{window.location = 'http://www.poetix.net/ventura.htm';}" onClick="if(window.external) {window.external.AddFavorite('http://www.poetix.net/ventura.htm','Poetix.Net');}else{window.location = 'http://www.poetix.net/ventura.htm';}">one I recommend you bookmark right now</a> is <a href="http://www.poetix.net/ventura.htm">Poetix.Net</a>. Phil Taggart does an excellent job of maintaining a fairly comprehensive listing of poetry goings on for Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</p>

<p>In the realm of poetry superstars, Lawrence Ferlenghetti (who was featured at last year's <a href="http://www.ovlff.com/poetryfestival/poetryfestival.htm">Ojai Poetry Festival</a>) will be <a href="http://www.sbpoetry.net/events.html">reading in Santa Barbara</a> this coming Thursday. And Pulitzer Prize winning poet Mary Oliver is coming to our area in January. Lots more poetic goodness on the horizon. Join me as I uncover more offerings, one stone at a time.</p>

<p>This is a photo of the mandala, which was painted in the intersection of Signal and Ojai Ave. by the community on Friday night before Ojai Day.  Local artist Ali-Sun painted the center.  Late Sunday night, they brought the firehoses and washed away the mandala, as if it were a Tibetan sand painting.  </p>

<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>As Shakespeare never said:</p>

<blockquote>Now is the summer of our discontent made glorious autumn . . .</blockquote>

<p>And a glorious autumn it is.</p>

<p>I've lived in Ojai for several years, sometimes making sojourns to distant lands like Poland (to teach English), Panama (to take photos), and Gettysburg -- where I recently wrote a play called "Christmas on the Mason-Dixon Line."</p>

<p>I'm hoping to produce the play at one of the theaters in Ojai.</p>

I knew that would get your attention!  I just thought I'd round things out and offer a bit of levity - I think we're ready.  All this politicking is getting me down, so I thought I would remind everyone to take advantage of the Ojai Film Festival, which opens this Thursday night.  A perfect opportunity to check-out, tune-in and suspend belief for awhile (that is unless you are taking in a documentary, so pace yourself).  I wrote an article about it, which is also now on newsstands in the <em>Ojai Visitors Guide</em>:</p>

<p><em>Photo from "The Cave of the Yellow Dog," courtesy of the Ojai Film Festival.</em></p>

<p>I will always say the best time to visit Ojai is during the autumnal equinox.  Whenever anyone quips that Californians donât have seasons, I simply retort, âSounds like you havenât been to Ojai in October.â  The liquid amber treesâ verdant leaves seem to turn to earth, rust and gold right before your eyes while an early morning light casts an umber glow across the valley that signals fallâs arrival.  Shadows lengthen and crisp sunny days yield bright blue skies that frame the Topa Topas in such a way that youâre sure you can reach out and grab Chief Peakâs nose.  And clear starry nights beckon you to a bench under a blanket in Libbey Bowl beneath 200-year-old oak trees to gaze up into a movie screen on the opening night of the Ojai Film Festival.  Itâs nothing short of magical.<br />

<p>From a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061004-7908.html">study</a> done by an assistant professor at Indiana University:</p>

<p>"The Daily Show is much funnier than traditional newscasts, but a new study from Indiana University says it has the same amount of meat on its bones when it comes to coverage of the news. The brand of news coverage Jon Stewart and the rest of The Daily Show's staff brings to the airwaves is just as substantive as traditional news programs like World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News, according to the study conducted by IU assistant professor of telecommunications Julia R. Fox and a couple of graduate students."</p>

The experiences of those workers and the impacts to families, community and employers provide insight and an understanding of the need for affordable workforce housing.

<p>The video beautifully articulates the disparity between the first world and the third world, and how modest amounts of well-intentioned money create great positive change, buoyed by optimism and hope.  I have tremendous admiration for Sarah, her management and her label, to make this elegant and effective statement.</p>

                              <p>Wall Street Journal reporter, Matt Phillips, contacted me recently about an entry made <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2006/04/ojaians_dvd_rental_habits_unco.shtml">here</a> on <em>Ojai Post</em>.  It was a quick post about the DVD's that our neighbors here in Ojai are renting.  I couldn't believe our little blog had been discovered by such a prestigious national publication.  It seems that Mr. Phillips has a knack for sleuthing out what's happening on the blogs, which gives him a good indication of what's going on with the Average Joe.  Often times when he's got an assignment, he will go online to see what people are talking about.  He plugged in "coffee table" and Netflix" into his search and, bam, <em>Ojai Post </em>came up.  </p>

<p>For several weeks since the June 6th Special Election in Californiaâs 50th Congressional District there have been reports of election irregularities. The DNC Voting Rights Institute (âVRIâ) has been monitoring the developments since Election Day and has raised a number of concerns regarding new and disturbing information. </p>

<p>First and foremost is the fact that any election where there are allegations of machine tampering, break downs in chain of custody, security breaches and other such irregularities must be taken seriously. There are several facts in this race that raise very deep concerns.</p>

<p>On the facts:</p>

<blockquote>LONDON - Syd Barrett, the troubled Pink Floyd co-founder who spent his last years in reclusive anonymity, has died, the band said Tuesday. He was 60.  A spokeswoman for the band said Barrett died several days ago, but she did not disclose the cause of death. Barrett had suffered from diabetes for years.

<p>The surviving members of Pink Floyd - David Gilmour, Nick Mason, Roger Waters and Richard Wright - said they were "very upset and sad to learn of Syd Barrett's death...Syd was the guiding light of the early band lineup and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire," they said in a statement.</blockquote></p>

<p><em>Allyson died Saturday at her home in Ojai, with her husband of nearly 30 years, David Ashrow, at her side, Powell said. She died of pulmonary respiratory failure and acute bronchitis after a long illness.</p>

<p>"I had the most wonderful last meeting with June at her house in Ojai. We had gotten lost in the car. She told me: `I could wait for you forever.' We were such dear friends. I will miss her," lifelong friend Esther Williams said.</em></p>

<p>Wasn't she the one who started the Hollywood-Ojai craze back in the day?  I know there is a significant historical connection here, but perhaps someone out there knows the particulars.</p>

Hundred degree days invite the emerald monster to creep in despite due diligence with chemicals and brushing.  </p>

<p>I wade in, brush in hand, ready to tackle the task at hand.  I scour, scrub and scrape, coaxing the grime away until my shoulders begin to strain.  Now and then the handle slips and I grate my knuckles on the side of the pool.  The scab from last week was just healing when I manage to grind it off again.  I wince just as a breeze kicks up, blowing more oak leaves in.  I had just scooped a net-full off.  I grab the net again, scooping more leaves and a drowning yellow jacket, too, who had no doubt just buzzed in for a drink.  A spider hangs off the coping and refuses to get into the net.  I grab the brush again and whisk it away.  A water bug swims around my waist.  Heâs swift and cunning, but I finally catch him and hoist him onto the deck.  Sydney, my yellow lab, sniffs at the hopping pest then quickly moves on to other smells in the yard.  I feel something crawling on my back. </p>

                              <p>I ran over to Bartâs Books Saturday afternoon to see if I could find a Ray Bradbury book.  I figured if I was going to a book signing, I ought to have a book for him to sign.  Iâm ashamed to say that I skimmed <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> in high school and spent more time with the Cliffâs Notes than the book itself, though it was practically beat into me how important this book was.  So, happy to have any excuse to venture into Bartâs Books, I willingly got lost between the stacks, meeting the torn and dusty likes of Joyce, Bronte, James and low and behold, nestled amongst the Sci-Fi section, Bradbury.  There was only one copy of <em>F. 451 </em>and I snatched it up like it was the last pixie tangerine of the season at the Farmers Market.  I read the inside cover: âFahrenheit 451 â the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and burnsâ¦â  An early eighties reprint, itâs in relatively good shape, with yellowing pages and notes in the margins that tell me this book was loved.  And at $7.50, a bargain find.</p>

<p>I sat side-by-side with aspiring authors at the <a href="http://www.ojaipost.com/2006/06/santa_barbara_writers_conferen.shtml">Santa Barbara Writers Conference</a>, waiting for Ray Bradbury to take the stage.  I eye the crowd, which was absolutely what you would expect of wannabe writers.  Not particularly well-dressed or even necessarily well-groomed, but certainly well-prepared and exceedingly punctual: a graying, balding, fifty-something bespectacled man with not three hairs on his head proudly collected into a pony tail; a tall, brooding, dark, big-haired woman with a fuzzy leopard print hat.  Nearly everyone had a writing implement, be it pen and paper or an IMac.  Geeks galore.  And I was one of them.  At least I tried to be.  Oh, hell, I desperately <em>yearned</em> to be!</p>

<p>Ray Bradbury, author of the <em>Martian Chronicles </em>and <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, is opening the conference tomorrow evening for the 34th year in a row.   He has held this tradition since the conference first started in 1972.  They say that if you have never heard him speak, you must.  I'm grabbing a ticket at the door for just $15.00.</p>

Make-shift tents covered the lawn area, keeping attendees dry, while the Corn Man sold the last of his barbecued cobs and the tie die and coconut jewelry vendors started to pack-up.</p>

I am going to go out on a limb here and make a confession.  Letâs just keep this between us, okay?  My musical roots lie somewhere between Wang Chung and whoever that guy was that did the Safety Dance.  Thatâs right, Iâm an 80âs girl and I still have the Footloose soundtrack cassette tape to prove it.  Sure, there was U2, Midnight Oil and Billy Idol â they rocked.  But mostly it was along the lines of the Go-Goâs, Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club and the Thompson Twins for me.  My mantras: <em>Papa Donât Preach</em>, <em>Girls Just Want to Have Fun</em>, <em>Everybody Wang Chung Tonight</em>.  I know, itâs a vast wasteland of a musical desert lacking substance and anything remotely considered to be talent.  So I knew when Tyler asked me to cover the <a href="http://www.ragejaxfoundation.com/">Global Groove Fest</a>, it would be a stretch for me.<br />

<a href="http://www.ragejaxfoundation.com/">The Global Groove Fest </a>is coming to Ojai next weekend and will feature nine bands over two days in Libbey Park, May 20-21.  In the line-up is the Los Angeles based fivesome, Particle.  Particle is a touring phenomenon, having played some 700 shows worldwide since 2000.  The band has been featured in Rolling Stone, CNN, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and now The Ojai Post.  </p>

<p>Eric Gould, bassist and founding member, told me in a recent interview that he and the band are looking forward to coming to Ojai, a place he visited once just a couple of years ago but has never played.  âWe love playing places for the first time.â  Having been on the road so much, being able to play just an hour and a half from Los Angeles feels like they are at home, particularly since they can just hop in a car and not have to drag out the tour bus.</p>

Itâs springtime in the park.  Birds are singing, flowers are blooming, children are laughing, sage is burning and hippies are drumming.</p>

<p>Iâm in Libbey Park on a Sunday afternoon and completely out of my elementâ¦and Iâm swooning.  Iâm swooning because I have found myself smack dab in the middle of Ojaiâs inner circle; that elusive place that we hear of in whispers, witness from the fringes and rarely get to experience ourselves.  Yet itâs what makes this quirky little town so endearing.</p>

                              <p>I just got DSL and Iâm a little loopy.  Until just a few days ago, I was on dial-up.  Not as horrifying an admission as the fact that I only wash my gym clothes once a week, but startling nonetheless.  It seems that in my little corner of the Ojai Valley, high-speed internet is pretty hard to come by.  Iâm on Earthlink now, and the experience thus far has been trying.  Sitting at my computer in robe and slippers on Sunday morning, on hold for an eternity with someone Iâm sure is on the other side of the planet trying to tell me just what buttons to push on my magic little box while watching Tim Russert put the hurt on Al Franken is not my idea of fun.  Iâm not blown away by the speed, either, as I had expected I would be (imagining wind blowing through my hair with each click of the mouse).  Maybe a visit to Tylerâs Tuesday computer clinic is in order.  But it has led me to explore this alternate reality we live in.  And Iâm not talking about Ojai, no, I mean the Internet.</p>

We all know of his work from his book, âColor of Ojai,â and of course, his calendars, which I buy every year.  So when I contacted him, he did not disappoint and offered up three amazing scenes.  I asked if I could share these images on Ojai Post, and he said it would be fine as long as they donât get used anywhere else without his permission (thereâs the disclaimer). </p>

I'm happy to announce that I've been dating a very lovely blues singer for one year now. Her name is April Hendrix. You can hear her sing at <a href="http://www.movinowinebar.com">Movino's</a> in the Ojai Arcade on Friday evening, March 31st from 8:30 till the wee hours. So anyway, to celebrate our anniversary, we cruised down the PCH through Malibu to see this wonderful art show <a href="http://www.ashesandsnow.org/">Ashes and Snow</a> adjacent to the Santa Monica Pier. This is a fabulous show, spiritually moving, sensual and powerful. Highly recommended, check it out. After a lovely dinner with April's godmother in Malibu, we drove back to Ojai and went to Joan Kemper's pad up on Saddle Mountain where a handful of Ojai moguls met to discuss this new pageant play "Ojai Rising" that Scott Campbell is putting together. More on that later. Here's to love and art. Peace.</p>

I donât sew, I donât cook, I donât clean and I donât scrapbook (yes, itâs apparently now a verb).  âItâs a good thing,â is not an abiding mantra for me.  But for some inexplicable reason, I do knit.  Not well, I might add, but Iâm getting along just fine with long rectangular projects, which despite the holes and bulges get passed off at Christmastime as presents for friends and family, much to their dismay.</p>

<p>Could be any day that I hop on the bike for a breakfasty ride up the path toward Starr Market. Crossing Montgomery I here a soft guitar and the soulful chirp of late boyhood. I briefly forget the grocery mission and turn to hear more. I pull up to a small gathering with familiar faces, a friendly enough bunch welcoming Charlie "Chaz" Benton's Gallery, <a href="http://www.brettdennen.com">Brett Dennen</a> is making sweet crushed velvet folk music. Charlie says "hello" and welcomes me inside for sparkling bevarage and baked goods.  I like Chaz' paintings, beautifully folky with vibrant colors and vintage frames. And I like his gallery: A little bit of pottery and a few other artists, not much more than a shoe box in the <a href="http://www.firehouse-pottery.com/">Firehouse</a> next door to the Art Center. </p>

<p>Where's your website Charlie?</p>

<p>And after a rich, buttery cookie, I duck back outside and continue on my way, rolling down the back pathway and over the Art Center bridge. I sidle through Libbey Park thinking about how lucky I am to be a human in this fine spot on the planet. </p>

<p>That's a rainy Monday Ojai memory.</p>
