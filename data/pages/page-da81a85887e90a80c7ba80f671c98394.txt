Here you will find step-by-step instructions on how to repair all kind of paint scratches and chips. I will also tell you what tools and products you need to make your car look like new again.</p>
<p>We all know that a small scratch can detract from a beautiful paint job, just as much as a bigger scratch. Paint scratches and dents are inevitable over the course of life of a car. Even if you bought a brand new vehicle and took good care of it, after a while it will get scratched from road debris, branches or little stones from the gravel driveway. If you’ve noticed new scratches or chips on your car, it is recommended to fix them right away. After some time, depending on how deep the scratch is, rust can set in, causing permanent damage.</p>
