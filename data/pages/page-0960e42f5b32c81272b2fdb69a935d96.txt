<div id="Quick-Cash-Auto-FAQ" class="tab_content">
<h2>How does Quick Cash Auto pay  more?</h2>
<p>Most car buyers will purchase your vehicle to then quickly sell  it at auction. This means the price theyâll be shooting for to resell it will  be considerably less than market price. This wrecks of disaster for you, the  seller, as the price those dealers will be looking to pay must be low to yield a  profit. Quick Cash Auto can sell your vehicle at retail, which means we can pay  you must closer to market price.</p>
<h2>How are  leased or financed vehicles handled?</h2>
<p>When a vehicle is leased or financed it doesnât mean it canât  be sold. It means only that the vehicle balance must be paid to release the  title. Depending on how much you, Quick Cash Auto can negotiate a pay-off  amount for early termination of the loan and get you out of that agreement with  any balance from the sale of your vehicle paid to you. We do the work of handling  the negotiation and payment of the amount owed to the bank to release the  title.</p>
<h2>Will I lose money if I do not sell privately?</h2>
<p>This depends greatly on how you look at it. Generally it  will take you time and money to list and successfully sell your car to a private  buyer. It takes time to meet the buyer and weed out those who will either not  show up, or are just window shopping (looking around). When you do find a  qualified buyer who has the cash, most times the time it took and the negotiated  price will be close to what it would have been to simply sell it fast with us.  Remember, many used car shoppers wind up at a dealership after they have  shopped around.</p>
<h2>An Internet site has appraised my car higher?</h2>
<p>The Internet is a great place to find deals on cars but donât  believe everything you read when it comes to selling. Few will pay the Kelly Blue Book price or some similar price from an online car  valuation service. Even private sellers will rarely pay a price equal to what  you may find online for a used private party sale. These tools are based on computerized  valuations and not actual sales. Although you can use these tools  for a basic idea of a vehicles value, you should expect 10% to 20% less than published prices. These web sites will not write a check nor will they offer any guarantee towards these quotes.</p>
<h2>What is the most accurate guide to price a used car?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.galves.com/" target="_blank">Galves Auto Price List</a> is the most accurate and timely guide to car values on the web. At Quick Cash Auto, we use Galves
 because it offers the most up-to-date vehicle prices on the market. Galves publishes values weekly and they are focused solely on car and small truck values. Galves is used by most dealers  throughout the United States. If you intend to sell your vehicle, it is important to obtain the most 
precise value, and Galves is much more accurate.</p>
