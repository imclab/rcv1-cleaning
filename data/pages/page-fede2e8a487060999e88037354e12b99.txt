<h2>Events 1970's</h2>
<ul>

<li>The <strong>oil crisis</strong> in 1973 was caused when Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), during the Yom Kippur War, announced that they would no longer ship petroleum to nations that had supported Israel in its conflict with Syria and Egypt , to the United States and its allies in Western Europe. It was also announced that the price for Oil would increase drastically. The west was by now dependent on oil and together with prices quadrupling and measures for rationing the western world went into recession and suffered massive inflationary pressure. At that time the United States did have their own oil reserves and although they were affected the biggest impact was on European Economies .</li> 
<li>After nearly 10 years of war in <strong>Vietnam</strong> 1973 was also the year that allied forces pulled out of Vietnam </li> 
<li>Another significant factor in the 70's was the growth in <strong>women's rights</strong> and women's role in society including the ability to decide when where and if they wished to have children ( partly through the availably of the contraceptive pill ) </li>  
<li>President <strong>Richard Nixon</strong> was forced to resign on <small><a href="http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/august8th.html"> 8th August</a> </small> as president of the United States due to imminent impeachment related to the <strong>Watergate</strong> scandal.</li>  
<li>With the continuing Cold War between the East and West the arms race continued  with each side trying to find the ultimate weapon </li>  </ul>

<h2>Technology </h2>
<ul><li>The 70's were the start in many ways of the Electronics and <strong>digital revolution</strong>, with the invention of transistors and Integrated Circuits in the late 60's, companies now found ways to use the technology which caused the phenomenal growth in smaller more powerful and cheaper products ranging from Calculators to Televisions. </li>  
<li>The decade also saw the beginning of the <strong>Home Computer</strong> due to Intel creating the first cheap microprocessor - the Intel 4004, and other integrated circuits. In the beginning the computers were mainly for the hobbyists and included the  Apple II, the TRS-80, the Commodore PET, and Atari 400/800 and with the growth of these home computers Bulletin Boards became a popular way for people to find others with similar interests    </li>  
<li>The first use of card access Electronic Locks appear  </li>  
<li>As people realized the power of these new home computers a new use was found and that was the beginning of the <strong>video game</strong> . When we look at those games now we see how basic they were but the technology available and the understanding of what could be done limited those early games.    </li>  
<li>With the invention earlier of the microwave oven and now the capability to manufacturer and sell cheaply many homes adopted the technology in their kitchens   </li>  
<li>Due in part to the increased use of the 747 a Jumbo Jet able to carry large numbers of passengers across continents air travel booms and causes new problems with pollution, delays and air traffic control  </li>  </ul>
