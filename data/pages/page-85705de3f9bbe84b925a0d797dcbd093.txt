He was known as a tough guy, and almost every character that he played worked on that persona in some fashion. A Charles Bronson quiz will show that he was born in 1921 and was actually born as Charles Dennis Buchinsky. 				</div>

					When setting up the main entertainment system in a home, it's important to take a number of factors into account. For example, will the room serve more as a meeting place for the guys on game night, or a quiet spot for the family to watch movies together? Each of these choices will lead the homeowner down different paths. The same goes for the key components of the room: the couches, the stereo, the television, and the stands that house the electronic equipment. Each can have a dramatic effect on a room and should be considered as an integral part of the decision-making process.				</div>
