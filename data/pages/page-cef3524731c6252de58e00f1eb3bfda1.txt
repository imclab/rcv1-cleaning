  <h2>Our Program</h2>
  <p><strong>One-Year Certificate Program </strong></p><p>
This one-year Ontario College Certificate program is designed for students interested in exploring fine art and art related careers. Students experience hands-on training in painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture and digital media. Students explore the role of artists in society and investigate career paths including the following: professional artist, gallery and museum programming, arts administration and art education. This program is ideal for students who want to prepare a portfolio for applications to university studies in a Bachelor of Fine Art (BFA). Students use skills acquired from the Introduction to Fine Art program to prepare for related fields of study in Applied Museum Studies, Interior Design, Photography and Arts Administration. </p><p>
Graduates are eligible to receive an Ontario College Certificate in General Arts and Science - One Year, with concentration in Introduction to Fine Art. </p><p>
