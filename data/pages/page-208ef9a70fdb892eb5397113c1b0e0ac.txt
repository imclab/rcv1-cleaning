      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color: windowtext;">The little known surviving
treatises and guidebooks of fighting skills produced by European
authors are numerous and diverse.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Books and manuscripts on personal combat skills
flourished in the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup>
centuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
oldest known European fighting text is an anonymous German sword and
buckler manual (MS I.33) produced around c. 1295. Its watercolor pages
feature a series of images of a monk and his partner performing various
attacks and counter attacks and has recently come to be more
appreciated as a source for study of historical European martial arts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The writings of the great
Swabian master Johannes Liechtenauer in the 1380s were highly
influential among German masters for the next two centuries. His
teachings, as chronicled by by the priest and master-at-arms, Hanko
Doebringer, were expanded and written on by many others throughout the
1400s and early 1500s including Paulus Kal, Peter Falkner, Hans von
Speyer, Ludwig Von Eyb, Gregor Erhart, Sigmund Schining, Andre
Pauernfeindt, and others. A major one of these commentators was that of
Sigmund Ringeck in the 1450s and Peter Von Danzig in the 1450s. Among
their teachings, these Fechtbuchs (&#8220;fight books&#8221; or &#8220;fencing books&#8221;)
present a consistent emphasis on unarmored foot-combat with long-swords
that incorporate grappling techniques.<span style="">&nbsp;

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color: windowtext;"><o:p>With the development
of printmaking in Europe during the 1400s, there also came a revival of
science and classical humanism. Both prints and drawings were integral

            1410 the Bolognese master Fiore dei Liberi produced a systematic work, 
            <i>Flos Duellatorium in Armis</i>, which represents the major Italian 
            contribution to 15<sup>th</sup> century martial arts literature. Three 
            different editions of Fiore&#8217;s work survive and have become major 
            resources for modern students.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Fechtbuch 
            of Hans Talhoffer covering among other things, swordplay, judicial 
            combat, dagger fighting and wrestling was also influential. It was 
            produced in several versions from the 1440s to 1460s. Other important 
            fighting texts surviving from the 15<sup>th</sup> century include 
            works such as the <i>Codex Wallerstein</i>, the anonymous &#8220;Gladiatorie&#8221; 
            and &#8220;Goliath&#8221; manuscripts, as well as the <i>Solothurner 
            Fechtbuch</i>. There is also an anonymous 15th century work on the 
            use of the medieval pole-axe, <i>Le Jeu de la Hache.</i> </span><span style="color: windowtext;" lang="EN-GB">The 
            King of Portugal, </span><span style="color: windowtext;">Dom Duarte,

            </span>While two obscure 15<sup>th</sup> century works on swordplay 
            from England also survive (the MS 3542 and MS 39564 documents).</span><span style="color: windowtext;"> 
            Fabian von Auerswald also produced a detailed wrestling manuscript 
            about 1462, of which a well-illustrated later edition still exists.<o:p></o:p></span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

            Vadi in the 1480s produced another major Italian work on fighting 
            from the period, which was highly influenced by Fiore&#8217;s. The 
            Hispano-Italian knight Pietro Monte produced several tittles on fighting 
            and combat skills during the 1480s and &#8216;90s, including the first 
            <i>published</i> wrestling book. Hans Czynner produced an illustrated 
            color work of armored combat on the techniques of &#8220;half-swording&#8221; 
            and dagger fighting in armor. Hanns Wurm&#8217;s colorfully inked 
            manual, <i>Das Ringersbuch</i>, of c. 1500 features a range of illustrated 
            wrestling moves and is characteristic of unarmed texts of the period.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            </span>Around 1512 the artist Albrecht D&#376;rer produced a beautifully 
            and realistically drawn work illustrating sword and wrestling techniques.<span style="">&nbsp; 
            </span>Several versions of J&#353;rg Wilhalm&#8217;s work survive 
            including a large hand-written color 1523 edition featuring an array 
            of unarmored and armored long sword techniques.<span style="">&nbsp; 
            </span>About 1540 Paulus Hector Mair compiled an immense and a well-illustrated 
            tome on weapon arts including swords, staffs, daggers, and other weapons.

            </span></span>Camillo Agrippa&#8217;s treatise on the science of arms 
            from&nbsp;1553 was one of the first to focus on use of the thrust 
            over the cut in civilian swordplay. Considered another one of the 
            more significant Italian fencing works of the 1500s, Agrippa&#8217;s 
            treatise also represents the transition from military to civilian 
            swordplay and the use of even more narrow swords. <o:p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></o:p></span></p>

            Dutch artist Martinus Heemskreck in 1552 illustrated a text, <i>Fechten 
            &amp; Ringen</i>, with several woodcuts of short sword, two-handed 
            sword, and wrestling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="color: windowtext;">The 
            German master Joachim Meyer in 1570 produced a large and extremely 
            well illustrated training manual that represents one of the high points 
            of 16<sup>th</sup> century works.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 
            work covered a host of assorted swords and weapons and combined some 
            Italian and German elements. Meyer included material on classroom 
            play as well as earnest self-defence.<span style=""> &nbsp; </span>Jacob 
            Sutor later produced a fighting manual in 1612 that was mostly an 
            updated version of Meyer&#8217;s earlier work. <o:p></o:p></span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">In 1570, Giacomo Di Grassi
produced, <i>His True Arte of Defense</i>, a major work on
fencing from the period that reveals elements of the changing nature of
civilian self-defense concerns and the development of slender duelling
swords. An English version was first translated in 1594.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Italian Girolamo
Cavalcabo&#8217;s work of c.1580, concerned primarily with sword and dagger,
was translated into German and French several times over the coming
decades.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1595
Vincentio Saviolo produced, <i>His Practice in Two Books</i>,
one of the more influential (and today popular) of late Renaissance
manuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Saviolo&#8217;s
method reflects the changing form of civilian blade in use.<span style=""> &nbsp; </span>An English version of the
text was influential at the time.<i> </i></p>

            Antonio Lovino in 1580 produced a large and elaborate fencing treatise 
            on rapier as well as other swords and weapons. Until recently, only 
            limited portions of Lovino&#8217;s work were previously known.<span style="">&nbsp; 
            </span>Other important Italian fencing works of the late Renaissance 
            include those by the masters Giovanni Dell&#8217;Agochie in 1572, 
            Camillo Palladini from c. 1580, Alfonso Fallopia in 1584, Nicoletto 
            Giganti in 1606, Salvator Fabris also in 1606, and later Francesco 
            Alfieri in 1640.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nearly all these works 
            reflect the transition from military swords to the civilian duelling 
            rapiers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1610, the Ridolfo Capo Ferro&#8217;s, 
            <i>Gran Simulacro</i>, was first published.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considered 
            the great Italian master of the rapier and father of modern fencing, 
            his work codified much of civilian foyning fence for the duel. These 
            Italian fencing texts offer some of the best of illustrated examples 
            of rapier fencing.<i> <o:p></o:p></i><span style="">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            master Jeronimo De Carranza wrote his influential tome on Spanish 
            fencing, </span>De La Philosophia de las Armas<span style="font-style: normal;">, 
            in 1569. It was to become one of two major Spanish fencing manuals 
            that formed the heart of the Spanish school for later centuries.<span style="">&nbsp; 
            </span>The other great Spanish master of the age was Don Luis P. de 
            Narvaez, who&#8217;s 1599, </span><i>Libro de las Grandezas de la 
            Espada<span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></i><span style="font-style: normal;">(&#8220;Book 
            of the Grandeur of the Sword&#8221;) presented rapier material somewhat 
            different than his master Carranza's. Narvaez&#8217;s book is the 
            other of only two major Spanish fencing manuals from the time. Several 
            Spanish masters during the 1600s produced fencing books rewriting 
            the teachings of Carranza or Narvaez and favouring one or the other.<span style="">&nbsp;

            </span><span style="font-style: normal;">a fencing master from Seville,</span><span style="font-style: normal;">

            young Italian soldier and swordsman, Frederico Ghisliero, in 1587 
            produced an unpublished work, the </span><i>Regole</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, 
            revealing connections to Spanish styles. About 1600 Don Pedro de Heredia 
            produced his, </span><i>Trait&#381; des Arme</i>s<span style="font-style: normal;">, 
            an illustrated color manuscript on rapier that included grappling 
            techniques. Heredia was a master-of-arms, cavalry captain and member 
            of the war council of the king of Spain. His work represents a pragmatic 
            Spanish style not wrapped in the geometrical ideas of Carranza and 
            Narvaez. Heredia&#8217;s manual is evidence the Spanish school was 
            neither uniform nor monolithic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mendes 
            de Carmona&#8217;s</span><span style="font-style: normal;">, <i>Libro 
            de la destreza berdadera de las armas</i>, an unpublished manuscript 
            of 1640 has also recently been rediscovered. </span><span style="font-style: normal;">Carmona 
            was a fencing master in Seville, who previously wrote a work on Carranza&#8217;s 
            method. </span><span style="font-style: normal;">His previously unknown 
            work is a substantial manuscript covering the principles and fundamentals 
            of fencing and tactics to use in specific situations. </span><span style="font-style: normal;">The 
            most elaborate and lavishly illustrated Renaissance fencing text was 
            that of Girard Thibault d&#8217;Anvers', <i>Academie De L'Espee</i> 
            (c. 1630), written in French by a Flemish master teaching a version 
            of the Spanish rapier.</span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="">&nbsp; 
            </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">The only truly French 
            fencing texts known from the Renaissance are that of Henry de Sainct 
            Didier in 1573, </span><i>Tracicte&#8217; contenan les ecrets du premier 
            livre de l&#8217;espee seule</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, 
            and Francois Dancie wrote his </span><i>L&#8217;esp&#381;e de Combat</i><span style="font-style: normal;">,</span> 
            <span style="font-style: normal;">in Tulle, in 1623.<span style="">&nbsp; 
            </span>The next known is Charles Besnard&#8217;s later, </span><i>Le 
            Maitre d&#8217;arme Liberal</i><span style="font-style: normal;">, 
            of 1653. <o:p></o:p></span><span style="">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            master George Silver published his <i>Paradoxes of Defense</i> defending 
            traditional English swordplay in 1599. He wrote his, <i>Brief Instructions</i> 
            <i>Upon my Paradoxes of Defence</i>, a year later. His work is the 
            primary source for information on English methods of martial arts 
            from the Renaissance and is a favorite study source for modern students 
            of historical fencing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Silver, a critic 
            of the rapier, pragmatically described the use of short sword or back-sword, 
            buckler, staff, and dagger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1614, George 
            Hale wrote,<i> The Private Schoole of Defence</i>, commenting on English 
            fighting schools of the day as well as recommendations on the rapier 
            method.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1617 Joseph Swetnam wrote a 
            rapier and back sword treatise entitled, <i>The Schoole of the Noble 
            and Worthy Science of Defence</i> and in 1639 one &#8220;G. A.&#8221; 
            published a book on swordsmanship, <i>Pallas Armata</i> <i>- The Gentleman's 
            Armory</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been suggested that 
            the author was one, Gideon Ashwell. By 1650 the Marquise of Newcastle 
            wrote his own short treatise, <i>The Truthe off the Sorde</i>, a little-known 
            work based on the Spanish School.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span><span style="">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            description of Renaissance martial arts literature is far from complete. 
            Many other fighting manuals were certainly produced in the 16<sup>th</sup> 
            and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries by a host of other masters and writers.<span style="">&nbsp; 
            </span>In 1620 for example, Hans Wilhelm Sch&#353;ffer fashioned an 
            enormous work, <i>Fechtkunst</i>, that contained 672 crude rapier 
            illustrations each one fully described and annotated.<span style=""> 
            &nbsp; </span>Other German fencing teachers in the early 1600s were 
            rewriting Italian texts. <span style=""><o:p></o:p></span><span style="">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            Dutchman, Johannes Georgius Pascha, in 1657 offered a rapier text 
            that included substantial material on the pike and unarmed combat.<span style="">&nbsp; 
            </span>Fencing works besides those focused on swords or wrestling 
            were also written during the Renaissance. For example, <span style="" lang="EN-GB">Andres 
            Legnitzer wrote on the spear in the early 1400s, while Ott Jud did 
            the same on wrestling and Hans Leck&#376;chner also made a treatise 
            on the <i>Langen</i> <i>Messer</i> (&#8220;large-knife&#8221;).<span style="">&nbsp; 
            </span></span>I<span style="">n 1603, the Italian, Lelio de Tedeschi, 
            produced a manual on the art of disarming while in 1616 the Spaniard 
            Atanasio de Ayala wrote a short text dealing with staff weapons</span> 
            and <span style="">Bonaventura Pistofilo&#8217;s <i>Il Torneo</i>, 
            Bologna 1627, was on the use of the polaxe.</span><span style=""> 
            Antonio Quintino&#8217;s 1613, </span>&#8220;Jewels of Wisdom.&#8221; 
            included 16 pages of grappling and wrestling in swordplay as well 
            as material on animal fighting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before 
            1620 Giovan' Battista Gaiani had also written two books on swordsmanship

      <p class="MsoNormal">The teachings of these masters
do not appear to reflect a set "style" or a "Way" so much as a
systematic tradition of using proven and efficient techniques within a
sophisticated understanding of general fighting principles. Much of
what we know of these many guidebooks and fighting treatises is
changing and expanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
just beginning, serious modern study and interpretation of Renaissance
martial arts literature is now well underway.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>In addition to those described here, many other
martial arts manuals were known to have been produced, but existing
copies have yet to be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Previously
unexamined collections that have recently become available and should
soon open up will inevitably bring to light even more source manuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an exciting time for
research as the hunt for further Renaissance martial arts literature
continues. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
