<p class="releaseDateline">Severna Park, MD (PRWEB) August 27, 2013 </p>
<p> Dr. Jennifer Levitsky, a practicing veterinarian in the Severna Park and Annapolis areas for over 13 years, recently opened Healing Paws Veterinary Wellness Center on Ritchie Highway just across the street from St John Catholic Church.  “This area is my home and my patients and their parents are like family to me.  I wanted to create a place where I could provide what I think is the very best in veterinary care.” Dr. Levitsky shared.  Healing Paws is a well-equipped, modern veterinary hospital offering general medicine, surgery, dental and preventative health services, but also provides holistic care including acupuncture, herbal therapy and homeopathy.  Dr. Levitsky wanted to offer something more.  “The missing component, in my opinion, was attention to the experience for both patient and their human companions.  From the moment you enter Healing Paws Wellness Center my highest priority is the comfort and well-being for both patient and owner.”   </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>At Healing Paws pets don’t have to deal with slippery floors, strange smells or sterile exam rooms.  Instead, you and your pet are greeted by a water wall, soothing music, rubber non-slip flooring and custom exam rooms with fluffy dog beds and plush window seats for the kitties.  The entire Healing Paws team is dedicated to ensuring each patient has a calm and positive experience.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Healing Paws focuses on your pets’ wellness and quality of life regardless of their age. Focus is put on client education so that every owner feels confident about caring for their pet through all of life’s stages. Our wellness visits include getting to know you and your pet, a complete physical exam and review of all health and nutritional issues.  We wrap up our wellness visits with a comprehensive plan to improve your pets overall health and well-being. </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Healing Paws Veterinary Wellness Center is open Monday – Friday 8:30am – 6:00pm and Saturday 9:00am – 1:00pm.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>About Jennifer Levitsky, DVM, CVA: &#13;<br />
<br />Dr. Levitsky received her Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine from Tufts University.  She is also certified through the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society (IVAS).  She has taken advanced courses in alternative therapies, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and herbal therapy at IVAS and the Chi Institute.  She has trained with Dr. Richard Pitcairn, founder of the Animal Natural Health Center in Eugene, OR.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center; ; overflow: hidden; color: #999999;">Myx TV premieres it first original reality series, Starcamp</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
                  &#13;</p>
<p class="releaseDateline">Los Angeles, CA (PRWEB) August 21, 2013 </p>
<p> As the old adage goes, there’s no business like show business. While the world is familiar with celebrity glitz and glam, actor and entertainer hopefuls understand the intensity of pressure and heartbreak that often comes with trying to break into the industry. Myx TV gives you a front row seat to follow a group of Filipino Americans in the quest for their ultimate dream as it launches its first and all-new reality series, Starcamp. Created by Grand Slam Productions, Inc., Starcamp premieres on Wednesday, September 4th at 8/7c.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The challenges will not be easy as candidates get the best yet most stringent training from vocal, acting, and modeling coaches and legends before they are put to the test. And as if competing against massive talent wasn’t difficult enough, watch them navigate through culture shock, language barriers and the nerve-wracking fear of performing on the big stage and on TV. With interesting personalities, the dramatic makings of primetime reality shows, and the mind-blowing talent and music of today’s biggest competitions, it is a must-see series where it all comes down to who will shine and who can survive.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>California auditions brought together singer Jaron Liclican of Milpitas, model Tommy Esguerra of Long Beach, Jemimah Garcia of Avondale, Arizona, California State University Carson graduate Matthew Wong, model Rhobbyn Concepcion of Chula Vista, advance theater and TV hosting-trained Allen Mendoza from Vallejo, multi-awarded saxophonist, singer and composer Nathan Concepcion, singer and dancer Ian Baclig of La Puente, Australian-born Karen Cabrera, and aspiring actress Jennifer Habana from Garden Grove. Together, they leave the comforts of home for a shot at show business on the other side of the globe. An exciting twist also brings Renzo Vergara of Antique, Philippines into the mix.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The 13-episode series traces the stories of each contestant, their auditions, and their adventurous travel back to the Philippines, where they will immerse in rigorous training offshore, working hard to become Philippine entertainment’s next big stars. Starcamp is hosted by Filipino American entertainer Amber Davis.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>“There is so much undiscovered talent in the U.S and showing how they get their first big break is a compelling story,&#8221; said Miguel Santos, General Manager for Myx TV. “Taking Filipino Americans to the Philippines to make it in show business there makes it all the more interesting. Starcamp broadens our programming line-up as our first original reality show.”</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Get ready for a one-of-a-kind reality series this fall. Catch the premiere of Starcamp, where entertainment isn’t just the destination, but one big adventure. </p>

<p>&#13;<br />
                  &#13;</p>
<p class="releaseDateline">Hollywood, CA (PRWEB) August 18, 2013 </p>
<p> This ain&#8217;t your mother’s book release party! Jon Morgan Woodward, Author/Actor/Writer/Producer, and Director John Carl Beuchler have created a mind-blowing party to go along with the release of the book, ‘Hidden Valley: The Awakening,’ the first of five adapted thriller screenplays from The Hidden Valley Saga Series, published by The Red Carpet Connection Publishing, Publicity, and Talent Agency.  The affair will take place at the Hayworth Theater, 2511 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90057, from 7:00-11:00 p.m. Tickets can be purchased from Eventbrite at  http://hiddenvalleybookrelease.eventbrite.com/.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>‘Hidden Valley: The Awakening’ was voted the most anticipated movie to be released in 2014 on IMDb. The release party, hosted by Actor/Comedian Brett Hunt, will feature the band, ROCKERO5, and songs performed by Hovhannes Babakhanyan, Donovan Dustin and Matthew Parry-Jones. Throughout the red carpet event, passed hors d&#8217;oeuvres will be offered, along with complimentary wine, and a cash bar with inexpensive drinks for purchase.  All ages are welcome.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>In Woodward’s novel, when three high school kids are attacked by a vicious werewolf, a chilling story unfolds about love, life and what lengths a small community goes through to try and win a high school championship. As the sun sets and the full moon rises, all hell breaks loose. Everyone has to fight to save their lives during a night of murder and uncontrollable slaughter in Hidden Valley.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The full moon arrives at 5:45pm PST August 20, 2013. Make sure you make it to the Red Carpet by 7:00 p.m., where your thirst for werewolves will be quenched when you get your personally autographed book by actors and producers associated with the movie to be released in 2014, Hidden Valley: The Awakening. Described as ‘addictive as crack cocaine,’ 200 limited edition copies of the book will be available in paperback at the release party.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>The weekend prior to July 2013’s full moon revealed a limited pre-release edition of Hidden Valley: The Awakening. Coinciding with the annual Comic Con International Convention in San Diego, CA., copies of the pre-release limited edition were distributed to a select group of fans, contributors, reviewers, and investors who love horror, thriller, and mystery featuring love, lust, blood, and werewolves. The book is receiving rave reviews.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>”One of the most entertaining books that I have read in this genre. It is a coming of age story filled with laughter and tears, violent and brutal murders, unbridled sex, and of course, werewolves,” commented John Carl Beuchler, Director of the planned movie. Beuchler signed on for the direction of Hidden Valley after reading just a few pages of the screenplay and the book adaption, which he described as “…so right from a cinematic stand point…viscerally and dynamically to the page as it would play on the screen.” </p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Beuchler is most noted for his Direction on Paramount Pictures’ Friday the 13 Part VII: The New Blood (1988) and his design as Director of Special Effects for Troll (1986). Buechler’s work in cinematic monster-making is legendary and some of his creative monster work will be featured in a special theatrical show at the book release party August 20th.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Woodward, an accomplished director, producer, screenwriter, and actor with a PhD in Naturopathy with specialization in Forensic Profiling, and a man who singlehandedly raised 5 children, brings a wealth of knowledge, experience, talent, and intrigue into this storyline that fascinates both young and mature adults as it delves into the mystery of this small town and its secrets.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Having been on stage since he was a child, Woodward is listed on IMBd for numerous accomplishments over the last 30 years, including the psychological thriller One Hour Fantasy Girl, and others, including Chances, The Day the Music Died, and IJE the Journey. Additionally, he has other major accomplishments including his involvement with the ‘Just Say No to Drugs’ Campaign with the White House Conference for a Drug-Free America under the Reagan Administration.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Adding to the music mix at the Red Carpet Book Release Party will be music composed by Andrew Lane, a Producer/Writer with Drew Right Music who has sold over 50 Million Records.  Lane and his team have been responsible for 11 American Idol top 6 finalists, signing 12 artists to major record deals in the US, Japan, and Europe, six series regulars on Disney/Nick/ABC Family/Major Motion Pictures with Tom Hanks Hugh Grant Act/ HBO/Showtime, The Voice, and many others.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Lane  is a pop/hip-hop/R&amp;B songwriter and record producer who has worked with artists such as the Backstreet Boys, Irene Cara, Toni Braxton, O-town, Snoop Dog, Britney Spears, Annemarie, Cash Money (Nicki Minaj, Drake, Lil Wayne) and Selena Gomez. Receiving gold and platinum accreditations for his work with R&amp;B artists Speech, Keith Sweat, and Alsou, Lane also worked on the platinum-accredited records High School Musical, Hannah Montana, Disneymania 4, Princess Diaries and Manny Fresh. The dance party August 20th will include the premiere of new music, as well songs from a variety of talented local Hollywood artists.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Actors slated to be in the movie version of the book Hidden Valley: The Awakening include actor Booboo Stewart,  who played the role of Seth Clearwater in the Twilight Saga Eclipse and reprised the role in both Breaking Dawn 1 and 2, Reatha Grey, one of the hip senior pranksters starring on the NBC hit series Betty White&#8217;s Off Their Rockers, actor/comedian/rapper Brett Hunt, actor James Cavlo, actress Kayla Tabish, actor Carlos Ramirez, actors Hector David Jr. and Najee De-Tiege from the hit tv series Power Rangers Samurai, actor Brandon Tyler Russell, actor Connor Mulqueeney,and actor Hassan Mahmoud are confirmed to be at the release party.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>States Mahmoud, also a writer, about the book, Hidden Valley: The Awakening: “Hidden Valley: The Awakening is fresh! It’s more than your average horror/love story. Woodward hits audiences on all levels of life and makes the story relatable to anyone who reads it, from teens to adults. This is going to be the next best-selling book series with a great new flavor!”</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>“Riveting!!! Hidden Valley: The Awakening is a rage of teenage passion bringing American folklore to life with horror in the modern era. A macabre of wicked truths revealed about the generation of our time.  I am engulfed by anxiety and despair by the curiosity of what is to become of the remaining characters,” remarks Carlos Ramirez slated to play a werewolf in the movie.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ; overflow: hidden; color: #999999;">Tim Urban</p>
<p>&#13;<br />
                  &#13;</p>
<p class="releaseDateline">Atlanta, GA (PRWEB) August 17, 2013 </p>
<p> Actors, Models and Talent for Christ (AMTC) has been the starting point for hundreds of successful artists and grads like Tim Urban, singer-songwriter with latest YouTube hit TEARS FOR HALLELUJAH, Maria Bradley, international fashion model, listed as one of the top 10 newcomers from this season now signed with DNA in NY and VIVA in Paris, Caitlinn Kinney, choreographer for dance film PLATINUM and stunt double for Bette Midler in PARENTAL GUIDANCE (2013), Josh Murray, actor, THE MAN IN THE CAVE (2013), National Geographic Channel’s production of KILLING LINCOLN  and most recently cast in the film FOR THE LOVE OF FISH, Charles Michael Davis commercial model for NIKE, actor in SWITCHED AT BIRTH and soon to be released motion picture ANOTHER STATESIDE, Stephen “tWitch” Boss from STEP IT UP REVOLUTION and SYTYCD judge.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>“Bad is bold in the entertainment industry, so good must be BOLDER.  It’s time for God’s stars to stand up on the stages of film, fashion, music and theater,” says Adam She, AMTC’s Executive Director.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Non-profit Christian ministry Actors, Models and Talent for Christ has been scouting the country, searching for actors, models, singers, dancers and comedians who are called to become positive role models in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Founded in 1982, by supermodel Millie Lewis and her daughter Carey Lewis, AMTC is a mission and a movement that provides aspiring performers with professional direction, industry introductions and spiritual preparation so they can shine for Christ in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>This anticipated Winston-Salem event will be hosted by Carey Lewis, Chief Serving Officer for AMTC. Carey says, ‘In our first 24 years, AMTC became a power player, launching stars in film, fashion, music and theater, but something was missing.’ She discovered the ‘It’ was God. Lewis had a ‘come-to-Jesus’ meeting in 2006. She felt called to bring AMTC along. ‘People thought I was crazy, that AMTC could not exist as a boldly Christian company, but they were wrong,’ laughs Lewis. ‘When God appoints a person or a company to a mission, He will see it done and nothing on earth can stop it.’</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Carey is thankful that AMTC has become a shepherd of God’s movement into media: the most influential mission field on earth. ‘God is preparing an army of performers.’ She says, ‘AMTC’s job is to find them and guide them up the mountains of arts and entertainment.’</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>AMTC teaches talented people what they need to know and connects them with an array of talent agents, managers and casting directors as the &#8220;go-to” source who can create larger opportunities, as confirmed by corporate representatives.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Actors, Models and Talent for Christ Winston-Salem auditions are being held at the Winston-Salem Marriott/425 North Cherry Street /Winston-Salem, NC 27101/phone: 336.725.3500.</p>

<p class="releaseDateline">Miami, FL (PRWEB) August 16, 2013 </p>
<p> Humanitarian activist Karuṇā Devī offers free, live meditation sessions on GammaGenius.com. She is also offering a helpful meditations book with various techniques on Indiegogo.com—in efforts to fund and expand her site. The site’s purpose is to bring together both scientific and spiritual aspects of meditation, inspire others to meditate, and examine it as a potential root solution to our planet’s most pressing issues.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>GammaGenius is committed to exploring meditation’s wide array of effects at the individual and collective level. It also seeks to present how the brain is affected by different factors, such as music and the environment. Essays and accompanying videos are meant to present concepts in a creative way. The site also offers free meditation sessions on its live page, and there are hopeful plans to expand it to include other live meditators.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Karuṇā believes meditation has unbounded potential in education. GammaGenius will also explore how this simple daily practice can positively affect education. She also wishes to look into the role it plays in enhancing creativity.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>In her live sessions, she emphasizes two techniques: Breath Awareness and Clear Mind. These two methods in combination, proved effective after one month of three daily thirty-minute sessions. By anchoring her focus on her breath and then going into Clear Mind, she overcame harmful and stagnating effects of stress and ADD to promote mental clarity, creativity, productivity, and well-being.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>She has observed people inspired to make positive changes from watching a documentary, reading a book, or listening to a talk—but sometimes revert. She shares that the way to create permanent change is by restructuring your own brain through daily meditation.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>There is a sea of information regarding this subject that Karuṇā wishes to disseminate through GammaGenius—from the scientific to the mystical. The funding she seeks is to provide this information to the public in a creative way. To visit GammaGenius, please go to: http://www.gammagenius.com.

<p class="releaseDateline">Plainfield, IL (PRWEB) August 15, 2013 </p>
<p> SharePoint® Server 2013 debuted in November of 2012. This computing platform incorporated some sweeping changes from its predecessors, including new systems architecture for Search, and Workflows, a re-designed branding methodology, and a new “App” model for developing processes. Rehmani Consulting, Inc. announces the immediate availability of sets of video training, each authored by an acknowledged subject matter expert, on SharePoint® 2013 Branding, Project Management, Development, Workflow, Search, and JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Asif Rehmani, company President, and, himself, a SharePoint MVP, remarks, “the SharePoint administrators, developers, architects and stakeholders, who are our customers, had a serious need for each of these training sets. I’m proud to report we successfully responded to their requests in record time. Any organization with a serious interest in any, or all of these topics, can obtain definitive industry best practices from the courses presented in these sets by our instructors who are, themselves, published authors and respected subject matter experts in their fields. Our customers can then implement the correct techniques to successfully achieve their objectives.”</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>These specialized training sets complement a core collection of video tutorials designed for a different audience, the end users who need to successfully accomplish daily computing tasks in a SharePoint® 2013 computing environment. When the company’s help system for SharePoint®, VisualSP™ is added to the training content mix represented by these video tutorial products, a highly compelling solution is available for any organization in need of a method to implement and support SharePoint® Server 2013 in a highly efficient manner. Asif Rehmani succinctly sums up the Company’s offers: “Our video tutorial content products can be bolted onto the backbone of VisualSPtm to create a highly capable system any organization can use, as required, to collect and expose the training content needed architect, build, administer, and support SharePoint® 2013 over its lifecycle.” </p>
