       Welcome to my Mercedes S500 Coupe auto page. The info here will assist you in troubleshooting the electrical 
       systems.<br><br>
       <FONT COLOR="BLUE">
       The info here is organized into "menus" consisting of all of the main ECU (Electrical Control Units) for the W140. 
       These ECUs all interact with each other via the CAN (Controller Area Network), so during an electrical problem
       it's difficult to conclude that just one ECU may be the cause because of the CAN interaction.  It's best to read
       <B>each</B> menu item after studying MENU#1's Engine Management Schematic showing how the ECUs are interconnected. 
       Menu#2 shows how to read DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Codes) from the car. </FONT> <br><br>

   <P ALIGN=LEFT>
   
   The 2012 California smog test for my Mercedes S500 was completed recently. I've kept the previous test results so I decided to see 
   what, if any, the results might show. The table below summarizes the <B>2000 to 2012</B> smog tests run every two (2) years.<br><br>
   
   The car passed with flying colors and looking back, has done well over the years. The catalytic convertor is orginal as is the
   "plumbing". Prior to the 2006 smog test, the O2 sensor, MAF sensor and <B>K&N Air Filter</B> were all replaced!  [Click 
   <a href="http://www.k6jrf.com/MB_MAF.html">here</a> to see the contamination from K&N filter]. <br><br>

   It's interesting to note that the readings have improved since then, especially the HC at highway speed. The pre 2004 
   results are much higher than the 2006 thru 2012 results. Significant change!

Similar to my Mercedes, I've kept the Smog Test results for my '90 Honda Accord LX. Since the car is <B>22 years old</B> and has original
smog accessories, it is time to replace/clean so that it will pass the 2012 smog tests.  As you can see, the 2010 results were very shakey.
I had a 2012 "pre-test" done to see how bad it is and it was bad! Although it did pass, it was just under the NOx and HC limits.<br><br>

The Honda's smog accessories were in bad condition; they were ALL original parts . . . with <B>148,000 miles</B>! The PCV long since 
ceased to perform and was now a "bi-lateral" valve.  The air-filter was plugged solid and finally, the EGR valve was badly carboned. In addition, 
the O2 sensor was also original as was the catalytic converter.  Note the readings were progressively getting worse with the years and the
"red" values show the 2012 PRE_SMOG TEST to see how bad it is. The results of the 2012 with the replaced smog elements are shown
in "blue".  Look at the change in the HC, CO and Nox results . . ie, Nox from 536 to 5 . . big difference!  <br><br>

So for about $500 total (including labor), 02 sensor, catalytic converter, PCV valve, air filter and spark plugs were replaced. The 
EGR valve was cleaned and is as good as new.  All in all, the CA smog Test results show it to be as good as a new Honda! <br><br> 

<FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="BLUE">Test Only Smog Stations</FONT><br> 
As you with older cars know, you MUST take it to a "test-only" smog center. I use and recommend Gary's test center. He's the owner/tech of 
<a href="http://www.15minsmogcheck.com/"><B>15 Minute Smog</B></a>. He stated that the "state" has forbid car warmup period. He used to rev the
engine and hold it at 2000+ rpm to ensure that it would have a "chance" to pass smog.  Now they want to start the car, idle it for 2 
minutes and go into the test. If the car was parked and shut off (as is the norm), the cat will be cold meaning that it could fail smog 
testing. Best to keep the car idling to ensure that the cat is hot. <br><br>
 
He said that the smog test software can't be re-run as could the older versions. If there was an "error" the test director could 
abort and restart the test. Not so today, so there's no room for an "oops"! <br><br>
 
It should be obvious that they want to remove the older cars from operation so you make sure  that the car is thoroughly warmed 
and has been taken on the freeway to fully heat the catalytic converter.  A word to the wise! <br><br>
 
Starting in Jan 2013, all 2000 or newer cars will be tested using their ON-BOARD systems; no interconnection to the smog stations
equipment.  I anxious to see how that is going to work out?? Older cars will still be tested as they are now. <br><br>

If you want to translate your smog parameters into Air-Fuel-Ratio (AFR), then download the 
<a href="http://www.jaysautoservice.com/Software.htm">Lambda Calculator Pro</a> program and
see how well your vehicle is "tuned".  Very simple and straightforward program to install and use.  My S500 cpe's AFR is "1"; ie
Lambda = 1 at both 15 and 25MPH.  Can't be better than that! <br><br> 

<FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="BLUE">Honda Lambda Calculation</FONT><br>
To plot the results of the CA Smog tests for my Honda, simply enter the numbers from the summary sheet into the program and it will
show how it's performing.  After entering the numbers for "25MPH", you see that Lambda = 1.008 meaning that the Air/Fuel (A/F) ratio 
is 14.82 yielding fuel mixture at <B>0.8% Lean</B>.<br>

   Get a cooler running Mercedes in 5 minutes! That's how easy it is to install either version of my 
   <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="RED"><b>Cool Harness</b></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">(c)</FONT> into your Mercedes Benz. Simply unplug
   the existing harness and install it into the <FONT COLOR="RED"><b>CH</b></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">(c)</FONT> and your MB will 
   reward you with a cooler operating engine.<br><br>
   
   Ever happen to you: <FONT COLOR="RED">While sitting in traffic after exiting the freeway, your TEMP gauge goes past 105C! So
   you shut off the A/C to cool the engine.</FONT><br><br>

   Well, you don't need to do that anymore!&nbsp; My <FONT COLOR="RED"><b>CH</b></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">(c)</FONT> tells the 
   auxiliary fan(s) to turn on at a lower engine temperature so it will keep you engine around 8-10 deg C cooler than before. 
   Either unit is foolproof, so you can't make a mistake and it only takes a short time to install. Simply unplug the car's 
   harness and plug it into the Cool Harness and you're all done.<br><br>
    
   Since the engine runs cooler, you'll have more usable horsepower available, so it's a good investment for your MB. <br><br>

   Both models of the <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="RED"><b>Cool Harness</b></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">(c)</FONT> are constructed from the 
   finest Mercedes - VDO - Xicon parts. The CH pins are all silver plated so they will not develop an intermittent connection.

     Over the past five years, I received many requests for a Cool Harness that will work in '95 and on Mercedes but 
     sadly there is no mating connector that will fit the new style four (4) pin sensor. So I've struggled with what could be
     done to accomplish this. But as many attempts where made to solve this problem, I couldn't come up with a clean packaged
     solution. One that an owner could 'drop-in' to their car <b>and</b> could be produced without excessive cost. <br><br>
     
     I considered such methods as having an injection molded assembly made that could fit inside the present sensor/connector
     combination but the expense was just too great. I finally got a 'workable' idea that I had originally considered some time
     ago but dismissed as being to difficult to construct. But after finding a source for sensors and needed parts, it appears 
     this <i>is</i> a viable solution for the late model Mercedes owner. The Cool Harness-V2 operates under the principles as the
     older version so electrically, they are both the same in terms of 'how-it-operates'.  The CH-V2 gives your car 'Cool Harness'
     action and, in addition, it gets a factory spec sensor ensuring that its performance will be what it was at delivery time.

   The <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="RED"><b>Cool Harness-V2</b></FONT><FONT SIZE="1">(c)</FONT> fills the void for the late model 
   Mercedes owner who wanted a Cool Harness. Now it's here after long last!<br><br>

   All of the comments for the original version Cool Harness apply to this version. The Cool Harness-V2 temperature cut-in 
   point has been set to 94 deg C. So only ONE (1) version of the CH-V2 is needed.<br><br> 
     
   The CH-V2 has two (2) separate sensors within the package. Mercedes changed to this combo sensor starting with '95 model
   year cars. It combines the original CTS (B10/8) and ECT (B11/2) sensors into one housing. In the CH-V2, the ECT sensor is
   'stock'. Also the modification to the CTS portion does <b>NOT</b> affect the ECT portion. Each sensor operates independently.

        want to thank you for such a cool (no pun intended) and clever device. The instructions provided with the harness could

        was complete. I installed the harness the moment I got home from work, a 90min commute in 85 degree weather today so 
        needless to say the engine was hot and the aux fans were running when I turned the car <b>['94 E420]</b> off. After the

   I recently ordered the <FONT COLOR="RED">CH-92</FONT> and I just wanted to get back to you on it, and tell you that this Cool 
   Harness is an outstanding buy!  I installed it in less than two minutes and from the very next day the car runs extremely cooler.
   I use to read the temp gauge before at 100 degrees and above, but now it reads just at or above 80 degrees constantly. I recently
   drove my S-class <b>['94 S500 coupe]</b> on a road trip from Tampa Bay to Orlando Florida and it was about 98 degrees outside.

   I received the Cool Harness yesterday and installed it immediately <b>['94 E420]</b>.  What a difference it makes. Heat index 
   today in Georgia was between 105 and 110.  Drove approx 35 miles this afternoon and temperature ran around 85 on the hwy.  
   Sitting at lights it may have gotten to 100 but dropped down quickly.  Thanks again! &nbsp;&nbsp; = BT =

   You can add me to your list of satisfied customers! I installed the <FONT COLOR="RED">CH-92</FONT> in my <b>'92 500E</b> in May 
   and it has kept the car cooler, even in the summer heat of Dallas! If you even need a referral, let me know. I'll be glad 
   to tell your prospective customers. &nbsp;&nbsp; = DH =

   This <FONT COLOR="RED">CH-92</FONT> is great. It fit my <b>'92 600SEL</b> V12 just fine.  On the V12s, the 'blue based' 
   temperature sending unit is in the very front of the car, next to the power steering reservoir, under a plastic cover with 
   MB emblem. About 10 min job, and most of that was getting the original connector off. So far it seems to keep temp right at 
   the low to mid 90's 'C on the dash temp gauge. &nbsp;&nbsp;  = BM = 
   <hr size=2 width="95%" noshade>

   I installed it right away and just came back from the test drive. Great product indeed, congratulations... 
   It really took me only 3 minutes to install<b>['93 600SEL]</b> it, including two to find out how to take of the plastic cover 
   on the engine. It's the <FONT COLOR="RED">CH-98</FONT>, and the fans cut in exactly at the 100C and shut off at 90C.  That 
   is exactly what I wanted!! Cheers from a satisfied customer. &nbsp;&nbsp;  = MM=

   Got the cool harness today, its awesome. Works like a charm, engine stays cool. Had a little trouble at first finding the

   The Cool Harness is absolutely awesome, it keeps the temp steady around 95 <b>['92 500E]</b>. I always thought that the engine 
   was like a CPU, keeping it cooler means it runs smoother. Very excited to see that it works as advertised. &nbsp;&nbsp; = GN =

   I received the <FONT COLOR="RED">CH-92</FONT> and installed it today.  Works great! The fans kicked on immediately because

   Got the part, the direction are very clear and the fan works very well <b>['94 C280]</b>. Here in South Texas is way to hot
   for not using this option.  It is a quality product you have built it looks very professional and unless anyone knows what to
   look for I doubt even the MB technician would spot it!  Thanks again. &nbsp;&nbsp; = LH =

   I installed the Cool Harness, <FONT COLOR="RED">CH-92</FONT> I got from you and my car <b>['89 190E]</b> never saw 100C again!
   Very neat, looks like OEM and it works! &nbsp;&nbsp; = MA =

   I just wanted to say thank you.  I received the part [<FONT COLOR="RED">CH-92</FONT>] today and installed <b>['88 300SE]</b> 
   it in less than a minute.  Now I can drive with piece of mind despite all the traffic and warm days here in Atlanta.

   I got a cool harness, <FONT COLOR="RED">CH-92</FONT> from you about a month ago and put it on my <b>'94 C280</b> here in 
   Tucson, AZ. I think it is a great part and I am sorry I didnt order it sooner.&nbsp;&nbsp; = MK =

   The <FONT COLOR="RED">CH-95s</FONT> both work as advertised.  Combined with the lower coolant ratios using WaterWetter in my 
   <b>'89 300TE</b>, I definitely see cooler engine temps.  My 420SEL was already running well within the 85-95 range. 
   Whatever the reason, the M103 engine tends to run hotter than my 420SEL. &nbsp;&nbsp; = EA =</FONT>

   <P ALIGN=LEFT>
       <Font Size="4">     
       This is one of the Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) that occurs in the Diag Module (Menu#6) which states: 
       <b> Fuel injectors open/short or self-adaptation in LH-SFI control module (N3/1) at limit</b>. This code lights the
       Check Engine Lamp (CEL) because it directly affects engine emissions.  It's not a 'nice' code as you will see!<br><br>

       <IMG SRC="DTC_LH_cmp.jpg" WIDTH="401" HEIGHT="350" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Closeup of LH-SFI Fuel Computer"> 
    
        The DTC_19 problem can happen in any fuel system. When it occurs, it means you have reached the limit of electronic
        adaptation correction. This problem originally started in hot humid climates and it caused the air/fuel mixture to get
        richer with great regularity. When the partial adaptation number reaches 0.85, the limit is reached and the CEL cames on!
        <br><br>
        
        So just erase and forget it. Sorry, this DTC is different from other codes. When you reset it, it will come back 
        within a few miles of driving b/c the self-adaptation (S/A) is at the limit value. When you reset this code, you are
        just resetting the CEL light in the Diagnostic Module (Menu#6) but you can't change the S/A value itself. If you think 
        you can get the car to pass a smog test, you are mistaken.<br><br> 

        1990 thru 1994 W124s and W140s had only +/-15% correction built into the fuel computer's firmware. MBs solution is to 
        sell you new firmware encased in new hardware at the cost of over $3000!  The firmware resides in an eprom that can be 
        easily replaced. A number of companies have issued updated firmware by replacing the eproms. Some examples are BMW, 
        Volvo and GM.<br><br>  

        When dealing with this issue, the amount of correction is one consideration, but solving the deviation is another. If 
        the mix has gone rich due to pressure changes or vacuum leaks, then fixing that is the correct solution. Many times it
        is due to a cracked/broken vacuum line, so that should be your first check point. <br><br>
        
        If nothing abnormal is found and if the car runs great, has no vacuum leaks, fuel pressure is within spec but still the
        CE lights showing DTC_19 meaning that the fuel computer is running "rich" and if it still has closed loop control of 
        Lambda then updated firmware (new eprom) will solve the problem.  New firmware allows that old limit of 0.85 to be 
        increased to 0.68.  In oher words, the limits have been increased to +/-32%.  MB found that the system will still have
        closed loop control, thus the new limits.<br><br> 
        
        The 119 LH cars seem to settle out with its long-term correction at or around 0.82.  When this occurred in my 
        '94 S500, it stayed at 0.82. It's now over 5+ years since the eprom was replaced, it's running fine and passing CA smog
        tests with no problem. After two years with the new eprom, the S/A was 0.85. I decided to replace the MAF and O2 sensor 
        since those are the two main sensors that determine S/A. Today, the S/A is 0.93 with the new eprom, MAF and
        O2 sensor.<br><br>

       <IMG SRC="DTC_detail1.jpg" WIDTH="511" HEIGHT="350" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Detail of Replacement Eprom"> 
 
        The new eprom has fixed <B>every</B> instance of the problem, <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">83</FONT></B> MBs (as of 7/29/13)! 
		It's a very cost effective way to permanently solve this problem. It can't be ignored if you live in a SMOG state since
	    even if the car's emissions are within limits (and many times they are!), it will not be allowed to pass since the fuel 
		computer has an "emissions fault".<br><br>

        The replacement eprom comes with a detailed installation instructions including the TSB info on the problem. You can 
        replace the present eprom with a newly programmed unit with the new firmware as described above. The picture shows a 
        closeup of the replacement eprom with the fuel computer open. It's a simple task to open the computer and replace the 
        eprom. The instructions cover all details of this task. <br><br>

       <FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE="3">Beside Ham Radio, I have another avocation, Mercedes
       Benz automobiles. Here's my story to date.<br><br>
	   
	   The 1994 through 1996 Mercedes Benz 'S' Series coupes were truly unique automobiles.  From the front end styling, similar 
	   to the 'SL' but unique with its all anodized aluminum grill complete with MB star, made this car a &quot;Teutonic&quot; 
	   presentation that's not been equaled since. <br><br>

       I first bought a MB in 1995, a little 190E with a 4 cylinder 2.3L engine. It was nice but a little small and it lacked
	   horsepower.  It, surprisingly, did not get very good gas mileage, around 19 mpg. I next purchased a 1993 E300 4 door sedan. 
	   It was a rare &quot;Sportline&quot; model. The 3.2L, 6 cylinder engine was more responsive but lacked the ride quality. The 
	   Sportline chassis is tuned very tightly and road a little too 'bumpy' for my taste.<br><br>

       Next I purchased a 1994 E320 Coupe. This was a unique auto, because 1995 was the last of that model forever! This is MB's 
	   mid size coupe. The color was midnight black with grey trim. The 3.2L, 6 cylinder engine was responsive and the ride was
       very nice. On the road, it got 24 mpg! An Alpine GPS system was installed and it made driving a pleasure, since one only 
	   needed to give me their address and it would take me there.<br><br>
 
       I have been looking for a clean S500 Coupe for about two years and it appeared a few months ago! Being a little fussy, 
	   there's some things that it had to have! First, the interior has to be 'black' with a dark color exterior. Of course, 
	   low mileage was desirable but what's more important is how was the car was cared for.<br><br>
       The service history was very good and it was garaged, another very important point. That's why the exterior looks so good. 
	   Of course, yours truly, did some refinishing to bring out that luster you see. Also had to do some minor engine work. Now 
	   you know what's been keeping me from the airwaves for the past two months! The only 'bad' feature is its 15.5 mpg city 
	   and 20mpg highway when you consider todays high gasoline prices.<br><br>
     
       The information on the following pages has been organized by major subsystems present in the car. After owning the car for
	   about 4 months, the infamous 'Check Engine' light illuminated and that started me on a major task to find what caused it. 
	   Suffice to say that this was the impetus for the following diagnostic data pages. The good part was that I <B><I>was</I></B> 
	   able to fix the problem! The bad part was that it probably cost me about the same amount had the car been repaired by MB 
	   (because I had to get some test/diagnostic equipment) but, now, I can fix any problem that occurs!<br><br>
	   
	   I sincerely hope that the data supplied here will give the DIY mechanic the required information in order to properly 
	   troubleshoot and fix the complex engine management systems in the vehicle.<br>

   We trend to forget about the car's motor support, the infamous motor mounts! Well, you shouldn't! When the MMs collapse, crack
   and split as shown, the engine effectively sits on the frame. All engine vibrations, and torque are transmitted into the 
   frame. <br><br>
   

   This may not be disastrous but when you change them, you'll be pleasantly surprised. So do it if your car has 90K or better
   miles on it! Found a new pair for (you better sit down), $50 on Ebay. Sometimes you get lucky!

	 The gasoline-powered 5 liter engine uses four valves per cylinder to increase the engine's capacity to 'breathe'.  The faster

	 The Navigon GPS Car Navigation, Model 7100 guides you turn by turn to your destination with high accuracy. It provides voice guidance
     prompts so you can keep your eyes on the road, while having the visual monitor for reference.  It has been rated as very user 
     friendly due to its ease of use and many options available for choosing your destination. <br>
  
     The Navigon uses colorful map displays as well as "3D" projection to show road geometries and upcoming intersections. Simple arrow guidance
     displays make navigation an effortless task. All information is thoughtfully laid out to minimize distraction and maximize 
     safety.<br>
     
     The previous system employed a "commputer" that was housed in the trunk where the CD-ROM master 'map' were read and then displayed on the
     high-precision monitor. It was very "slow"!! The Navigon unit holds the complete US and Canada map system in 2GB of flash memory chip. 
     The nice feature is its 'speed' at both calculating the route but also re-calculating a change in the route. The previous roof top GPS
     antenna is not needed since this unit has a built-in antenna. One great feature is the TMC mode where all local traffic conditions can be
     displayed and can form the basis of route modification.

     Rudy contacted me regarding purchasing a Cool Harness and after one email lead to another, I found this talented man's 
     'real' talent, rebuilding junked Mercedes-Benz cars. Look at these photos and see if you don't agree!   Here's what 
     Rudy wrote to me. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JimF</FONT>

     I basically repaired this sad C280 into an AMG C36. Tried to come as close as possible to the specs of the C36.  The project 
     took me 4 months and I spent a lot of time on the web looking for junk yards to locate all the necessary hardware. The hardest
     part of the project was letting go of this beauty. The new owners reside in the Riverside, CA area.  
     They previously lived in Connecticut.<br><br>

     I started about 4 years ago when a friend of mine in the insurance business told me about purchasing cars directly from him.
     At that time I didn't think much about it but now every 3 months I purchase a Benz, rebuild and sell it.  Funny cause it's 
     not for the money but rather a hobby. Besides nothing like seeing the end results of these beautiful cars!<br><br>

    I don't do this full time. I'm a Systems Administrator (MCSE) during the day and rebuilding cars is my hobby.  The only thing
    I don't do on these cars is the welding, painting and well, now I will be able to reset codes thanks to your scanner.  All 
    else is done by me and sometimes with my wife's help!  I don't have a web site but you are welcome to show off these pictures 
    on your site.  I'll send you pictures of the '89 190E 2.6 that I restored for my wife in the near future.<br><br>
