The Aurora History Museum is puny compared to the gleaming History Colorado, set to open in Denver this spring. But what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for in honesty &mdash; and accessibility. Not only is the museum free to visit, it's also very free with the facts.

A grawlix is a sequence of typographical symbols used to represent a non-specific profane word or phrase, like this: #@$%*! But there's nothing that coy about Grawlix, the monthly alternative-comedy night formerly known as Los Comicos Super-Hilariosos that features Ben Roy, 2012 MasterMind Andrew Orvedahl and former Westword staffer Adam Cayton-Holland, with frequent special-guest comedians from across the country.

If you're itching to sound off, the best karaoke nights in town are at a spot hidden away on a Westminster building's backside (thus the moniker, we presume).

Looking through your old journals can be fun, but reading from them while you're on stage in front of a room full of strangers somehow makes the experience incredibly awesome. From first-period nightmares to tales of selling kids fake LSD, the true stories keep spilling out during the monthly My Teenage Angst, each one more painfully true than the next.&hellip; <a class='more' href='/bestof/2012/award/best-way-to-publicly-embarrass-yourself-and-still-have-fun-2117982/'>More >></a>

<h4>Best Theater Season</h4>
<h3><a href='/bestof/2012/award/best-theater-season-2118152/'>Curious Theatre Company</a></h3>
If Curious Theatre Company had only brought us Clybourne Park &mdash; Bruce Norris's witty and insightful update of Lorraine Hansberry's famed A Raisin in the Sun &mdash; this season, well, dayenu, as we say at Passover: It would have been enough. If artistic director Chip Walton had seized only on Tony Kushner's Homebody/Kabul to introduce to Denver audiences, that might&hellip; <a class='more' href='/bestof/2012/award/best-theater-season-2118152/'>More >></a>

<h4>Best Annual Festival</h4>
<h3><a href='/bestof/2012/award/best-annual-festival-2118153/'>Denver County Fair</a></h3>
Last summer's inaugural Denver County Fair, which took shape in the fertile, never-say-never imaginations of event promoter/dreamer Dana Cain and artist/gardener/doer Tracy Weil (not to mention pie-making artist Chandler Romeo, who came up with the original concept), cut through every cultural cross-section you could think of. There was fashion. There was urban commerce. There were pancakes, chickens, a freak show,&hellip; <a class='more' href='/bestof/2012/award/best-annual-festival-2118153/'>More >></a>

<h4>Best Museum Exhibit</h4>

In the spring of 2011, Jill Desmond, then a young curatorial assistant at the Denver Art Museum, looked at the contents of the permanent collection in the Modern and Contemporary department and realized there were a lot of high-tech pieces. Enough, it turns out, to pull off the blockbuster Blink!

<h4>Best Risk-Taking Evening of Theater</h4>

Entering the Aurora Fox's black-box theater for K2, audience members were confronted by a steep cliff (a miraculous piece of design by Charles Packard), where two men were sitting on a ledge. Pakistan's K2 is the second-highest mountain in the world, and it kills climbers; these two men are stranded there.

Okay, the Clyfford Still Museum has only had one show, but it's so incredible, it deserves its own award. The spectacular Inaugural Exhibition was organized by Dean Sobel, the museum's founding director. Five years ago, Sobel was one of only a handful of people who had actually seen Still's work, since the artist was a major recluse.

The opening of the Clyfford Still Museum inspired several other Denver venues to present shows tied to the momentous event, and several of these displays set a very high standard. The most gorgeous example was AB EX, at the museum-sized Robischon Gallery. Designed by Jennifer Doran, who owns the flagship space with her husband, Jim Robischon, AB EX covered a&hellip; <a class='more' href='/bestof/2012/award/best-show-saluting-clyfford-still-2118157/'>More >></a>

That Mythica von Griffyn is a colorful character goes without saying once you've met her. That's partly because she holds down some of the rarest jobs on earth: She turns models into exotic birds, sidewalks into masterpieces and actors into the walking dead. And sometimes she simply is the walking dead, as a character herself in haunted houses.

People still flip out when they learn they can check out a pigeon at the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver &mdash; and we don't mean that they can just see one; we mean they can check one out like a library book, then take it home &mdash; with the stipulation that they then let it loose.

<h4>Best Historic Show &mdash; Solo</h4>
<h3><a href='/bestof/2012/award/best-historic-show-andmdash-solo-2118160/'>Sandzen in Colorado</a></h3>
For decades during the first half of the twentieth century, Birger Sandz&eacute;n, a Swedish painter based in Kansas, spent his summers in Colorado recording the celebrity scenery in photos, drawings and, most famously, paintings. His signature style &mdash; characterized by wild flourishes of brushwork carried out in cotton-candy shades of thick paint &mdash; created a bridge linking post-impressionism to abstract&hellip; <a class='more' href='/bestof/2012/award/best-historic-show-andmdash-solo-2118160/'>More >></a>

Denver not only boasts the 2011 national champion slam-poetry team, Slam Nuba, but in March the city hosted its largest poetry event to date: the Women of the World Poetry Slam.

The trend in central Denver galleries, especially in RiNo, is to tout exhibit spaces as extensions of someone's home, as found at places like Hinterland and Pattern Shop Studio. But when Tran and Josh Wills rolled up the garage door on Super Ordinary last year, they inaugurated a new underground house-gallery: In the same space where their kids like to&hellip; <a class='more' href='/bestof/2012/award/best-gallery-in-a-garage-2118162/'>More >></a>

The late Vance Kirkland is unquestionably the most famous abstract painter in the history of Colorado art, making the Kirkland Museum the perfect place to mount a show about abstraction in this state. The four-part show, which is still on view, was conceived by museum director Hugh Grant, using his usual more-is-more style.

The art scene we have today in Denver is rooted in the late '70s and early '80s. That's when the first co-ops were founded and a generation of galleries began coming on line, with a crowd of artists emerging to fill those places; the first First Friday celebrations even date to that era.

Colorado Springs artist Sean O'Meallie managed to change deep-seated ideas about chairs in a single day. But it really took many months of hard work &mdash; planning, fundraising and chair-collecting &mdash; to bring the Manitou Chair Project to fruition.

The University of Denver has featured important artists on its faculty since Vance Kirkland founded the department in the 1920s. Dan Jacobs, director of the Victoria H.

It's not that easy to put together a coherent show with the works of two artists with distinct sensibilities, but Space Gallery definitely hit the mark with Dissection &amp; Deregulation: Michael Burnett and Lewis McInnis.

The hippie movement of the '60s and '70s played an important part in Colorado history. Like other spots in the American West, this state was invaded by hordes of young free-thinkers in VW buses; they camped out in Capitol Hill, Boulder, Nederland and Manitou Springs, as well as more isolated spots.

Except for the fact that they are both well-established artists, the two men featured in I Gotcha Covered: Roland Bernier and Bill Vielehr have nothing in common. Roland Bernier's visual language is actually language &mdash; in this show, giant letters in alphabetical order &mdash; which he uses as found compositions for his conceptual pieces.

A magnificent traveling show at the Denver Art Museum, Robert Adams: The Place We Live provided an in-depth look at one of the most important artists associated with Colorado.

For Bradley Borthwick: Not All Borthwicks Were Noblemen, artist Bradley Borthwick constructed an elaborate installation, staged a performance with deadly weapons, and acted nude in a film with an alternately pounding and haunting soundtrack meant to document a ritual he'd created. As it turned out, many of Borthwick's Scottish ancestors, all noblemen, had been slaughtered by the English using longbows,&hellip; <a class='more' href='/bestof/2012/award/best-multimedia-show-2118177/'>More >></a>

For MCA Denver's Another Victory Over the Sun, put together by museum director Adam Lerner and assistant curator Nora Burnett Abrams, all of the exterior light sources were blocked, making the interior fairly dark, with the works only minimally lighted.

Many of these artists were riffing off toys or the idea of play, as indicated by the show's title, Toy Stories.
