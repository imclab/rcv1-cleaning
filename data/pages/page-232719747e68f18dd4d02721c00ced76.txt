        an art form practised mainly for its aesthetic value and its beauty (&quot;art

        in <a href="../drawing.htm">drawing</a> and design-based works such as 
        <a href="../fine-art-painting.htm">painting</a>, printmaking, and <a href="../sculpture.htm">sculpture</a>. 
        It is often contrasted with &quot;<a href="applied-art.htm">applied art</a>&quot; 
        and &quot;crafts&quot; which are both traditionally seen as utilitarian 
        activities. Other non-design-based activities regarded as fine arts, include

        an applied art.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This type of art dates back to the Acheulian 
        period of <a href="../prehistoric-art.htm">prehistoric art</a>: to proto-sculptures 
        such as the Venus of Berekhat Ram (a basaltic figurine, 230,000-700,000 
        BCE) and the Venus of Tan-Tan (quartzite figurine, 200,000-500,000 BCE); 
        and to <a href="../prehistoric/cave-painting.htm">cave paintings</a> from 
        Chauvet Cave (c.30,000 BCE), Lascaux, Altamira, Pech-Merle, and Cosquer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the era of ancient Mediterranean 
        civilizations, including those of later Greek, Roman and Byzantine culture, 
        as well as medieval Carolingian, Ottonian, Romanesque and Gothic art, 
        fine artists were regarded as mere skilled-workers - like skilled interior 
        decorators or carvers. It wasn't until the Renaissance, that the profession 
        of &quot;artist&quot; was raised to a new higher level, reflecting the 
        newly perceived importance of the &quot;design&quot; element - or &quot;<a href="../drawing/disegno.htm">disegno</a>&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Fine Arts Academies</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the 16th century onwards, students 
        who wished to enter the new profession of artist were trained in special 
        academies, set up across Europe. The two earliest were the Academy of 
        the Art of Design in Florence (<i>Accademia dell'Arte del Disegno</i>) 
        and the Fine Art Academy of Rome (<i>Accademia di San Luca</i>). These 
        educational institutions taught a highly traditional type of &quot;<a href="../history-of-art/academic-art.htm">academic 
        art</a>&quot;, founded on the principles of <a href="../renaissance-art.htm">Renaissance 
        art</a>, which regulated things like subject matter, form, message, composition, 
        colour and so on. [See: <a href="../drawing/renaissance-drawings.htm">Best 
        Renaissance Drawings</a>. See also our list of the <a href="../history-of-art/renaissance-paintings.htm">Greatest 
        Renaissance Paintings</a>.] They also laid down a strict <a href="../history-of-art/hierarchy-of-genres.htm">Hierarchy 
        of the Genres</a>, which ranked the <a href="../painting-genres.htm">painting 
        genres</a> in the following order of importance: (1) History painting 
        (2) Portraiture (3) Genre-paintings (4) Landscape (5) Still Life. Thus 
        a history painting (meaning a picture with an uplifting &quot;<i>istoria</i>&quot; 
        or narrative) was rated as more edifying than a landscape, devoid of any 
        human content, or moral. Academies remained the bastions of traditional 
        fine art until the 20th century, when Cubism, Dada and Surrealism swept 
        away their neat set of rules.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Modern/Contemporary Fine Art</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Contemporary artists have further extended 
        the boundaries of fine art. The <a href="plastic-art.htm">plastic art</a> 
        of sculpture now employs a range of new materials, as well as new forms 
        (assemblage, land art etc). Printmaking has taken advantage of new commercial 
        printing processes, like silkscreen printing and giclee prints. It surely 
        won't be long before installations are regarded as fine art.</font></p>

        fine art, particularly if its <a href="aesthetics.htm">aesthetics</a>

        Chartres Cathedral, the Taj Mahal and the Eiffel Tower, are important 
        cultural symbols and works of art, symbolizing their historical civilization. 
        Even so, architecture shares little with other fine art disciplines, and 
        may rightly be regarded as more of an applied art.</font></p>
