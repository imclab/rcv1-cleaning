<P>Several Italians recorded designs for wind driven vehicles. The first
was Guido da Vigevano in 1335. It was a windmill type drive to gears and
thus to wheels. Vaturio designed a similar vehicle which was also never
built. Later Leonardo da Vinci designed a clockwork driven tricycle with
tiller steering and a differential mechanism between the rear wheels.</P>

<P>A Catholic priest named Father Ferdinand Verbiest has been said to have
built a steam powered vehicle for the Chinese Emperor Chien Lung in about
1678. There is no information about the vehicle, only the event. Since <A
HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/newcomen_thomas.shtml">Thomas
Newcomen</A> didn't build his first steam engine until 1712 we can guess
that this was possibly a model vehicle powered by a mechanism like Hero's
steam engine, a spinning wheel with jets on the periphery. Newcomen's engine
had a cylinder and a piston and was the first of this kind, and it used
steam as a condensing agent to form a vacuum and with an overhead walking
beam, pull on a rod to lift water. It was an enormous thing and was strictly
stationary. The steam was not under pressure, just an open boiler piped
to the cylinder. It used the same vacuum principle that <A HREF="http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blsavery1.htm">Thomas
Savery</A> had patented to lift water directly with the vacuum, which would
have limited his pump to less than 32 feet of lift. Newcomen's lift would
have only been limited by the length of the rod and the strength of the
valve at the bottom. Somehow Newcomen was not able to separate his invention
from that of Savery and had to pay for Savery's rights. In 1765 <A HREF=
"http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/watt.htm">James Watt</A> developed
the first pressurized steam engine which proved to be much more efficient
and compact that the Newcomen engine.</P>

<P>The first vehicle to move under its own power for which there is a record
was designed by Nicholas Joseph Cugnot and constructed by M. Brezin in 1769.
A replica of this vehicle is on display at the <CITE>Conservatoire des Arts
et Metiers</CITE>, in Paris. I believe that the Smithsonian Museum in Washington
D. C. also has a large (half size ?) scale model. A second unit was built
in 1770 which weighed 8000 pounds and had a top speed on 2 miles per hour
and on the cobble stone streets of Paris this was probably as fast as anyone
wanted to go it. The picture shows the first model on its first drive around
Paris were it hit and knocked down a stone wall. It also had a tendency
to tip over frontward unless it was counterweighted with a canon in the
rear. the purpose of the vehicle was to haul canons around town.</P>

<P>The early steam powered vehicles were so heavy that they were only practical
on a perfectly flat surface as strong as iron. A road thus made out of iron
rails became the norm for the next hundred and twenty five years. The vehicles
got bigger and heavier and more powerful and as such they were eventually
capable of pulling a train of many cars filled with freight and passengers.</P>

<P><A HREF="carrace.jpg"><IMG SRC="Carraces.jpg" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="106"
ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>As the picture at the right shows,
many attempts were being made in England by the 1830's to develop a practical
vehicle that didn't need rails. A series of accidents and propaganda from
the established railroads caused a flurry of restrictive legislation to
be passed and the development of the automobile bypassed England. Several
commercial vehicles were built but they were more like trains without tracks.</P>

<P>The development of the internal combustion engine had to wait until a
fuel was available to combust internally. Gunpowder was tried but didn't
work out. Gunpowder carburetors are still hard to find. The first gas really
did use gas. They used coal gas generated by heating coal in a pressure
vessel or boiler. A Frenchman named Etienne Lenoir patented the first practical
gas engine in Paris in 1860 and drove a car based on the design from Paris
to Joinville in 1862. His one-half horse power engine had a bore of 5 inches
and a 24 inch stroke. It was big and heavy and turned 100 rpm. Lenoir died
broke in 1900.</P>

<P>Lenoir had a separate mechanism to compress the gas before combustion.
In 1862, Alphonse Bear de Rochas figured out how to compress the gas in
the same cylinder in which it was to burn, which is the way we still do
it. This process of bringing the gas into the cylinder, compressing it,
combusting the compressed mixture, then exhausting it is know as the Otto
cycle, or four cycle engine. Lenoir claimed to have run the car on benzene
and his drawings show an electric spark ignition. If so, then his vehicle
was the first to run on petroleum based fuel, or petrol, or what we call
gas, short for gasoline.</P>

<P>Siegfried Marcus, of Mecklenburg, built a can in 1868 and showed one
at the Vienna Exhibition of 1873. His later car was called the <CITE>Strassenwagen
</CITE>had about 3/4 horse power at 500 rpm. It ran on crude wooden wheels
with iron rims and stopped by pressing wooden blocks against the iron rims,
but it had a clutch, a differential and a magneto ignition. One of the four
cars which Marcus built is in the Vienna Technical Museum and can still
be driven under its own power.</P>

<P>In 1876, Nokolaus Otto patented the Otto cycle engine, de Rochas had
neglected to do so, and this later became the basis for Daimler and Benz
breaking the Otto patent by claiming prior art from de Rochas.</P>

<P><A HREF="benzbike.jpg"><IMG SRC="Benzbiks.jpg" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="122"
ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>The picture to the left, taken in 1885,
is of Gottllieb Daimler's workshop in Bad Cannstatt where he built the wooden
motorcycle shown. Daimler's son Paul rode this motorcycle from Cannstatt
to Unterturkheim and back on November 10, 1885. Daimler used a hot tube
ignition system to get his engine speed up to 1000 rpm</P>

<P>The previous August, Karl Benz had already driven his light, tubular
framed tricycle around the Neckar valley, only 60 miles from where Daimler
lived and worked. They never met. Frau Berta Benz took Karl's car one night
and made the first long car trip to see her mother, traveling 62 miles from
Mannheim to Pforzheim in 1888.</P>

<P>Also in August 1888, William Steinway, owner of Steinway &amp; Sons piano
factory, talked to Daimler about US manufacturing right and by September
had a deal. By 1891 the Daimler Motor Company, owned by Steinway, was producing
petrol engines for tramway cars, carriages, quadricycles, fire engines and
boats in a plant in Hartford, CT.</P>

<P>Steam cars had been built in America since before the Civil War but the
early one were like miniature locomotives. In 1871, Dr. J. W. Carhart, professor
of physics at Wisconsin State University, and the J. I. Case Company built
a working steam car. It was practical enough to inspire the State of Wisconsin
to offer a $10,000 prize to the winner of a 200 mile race in 1878.&gt;(see more 
on <a href="JWCarhart.htm">J. W. Carhart story from Fredric Dennis Williams</a>)</P>

<P>The 200 mile race had seven entries, or which two showed up for the race.
One car was sponsored by the city of Green Bay and the other by the city
of Oshkosh. The Green Bay car was the fastest but broke down and the Oshkosh
car finished with an average speed of 6 mph.</P>

<P><A HREF="oldsteam.jpg"><IMG SRC="Oldsteas.jpg" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="178"
ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>From this time until the end of the
century, nearly every community in America had a mad scientist working on
a steam car. Many old news papers tell stories about the trials and failures
of these would be inventors.</P>

<P>By 1890 Ransom E. Olds had built his second steam powered car, pictured
at left. One was sold to a buyer in India, but the ship it was on was lost
at sea.</P>

<P><A HREF="duryea1.jpg"><IMG SRC="Duryes1.jpg" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="166"
ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Running by February, 1893 and ready
for road trials by September, 1893 the car built by Charles and Frank Duryea,
brothers, was the first gasoline powered car in America. The first run on
public roads was made on September 21, 1893 in Springfield, MA. They had
purchased a used horse drawn buggy for $70 and installed a 4 HP, single
cylinder gasoline engine. The car (buggy) had a friction transmission, spray
carburetor and low tension ignition. It must not have run very well because
Frank didn't drive it again until November 10 when it was reported by the
<CITE>Springfield Morning Union</CITE> newspaper. This car was put into
storage in 1894 and stayed there until 1920 when it was rescued by Inglis
M. Uppercu and presented to the United States National Museum.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A HREF="fordfst.jpg"><IMG SRC="Fordfsts.jpg" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="118"
ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Henry Ford had an engine running by
1893 but it was 1896 before he built his first car. By the end of the year
Ford had sold his first car, which he called a Quadracycle, for $200 and
used the money to build another one. With the financial backing of the Mayor
of Detroit, William C. Maybury and other wealthy Detroiters, Ford formed
the Detroit Automobile Company in 1899. A few prototypes were built but
no production cars were ever made by this company. It was dissolved in January
1901. Ford would not offer a car for sale until 1903.</P>

<P><A HREF="fstcirct.jpg"><IMG SRC="Fstcircs.jpg" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="80"

race held at Narragansett Park, Rhode Island, in September 1896. All four
cars to the left are Duryeas, on the right is a Morris &amp; Salom Electrobat.
Thirteen Duryeas of the same design were produced in 1896, making it the
first production car.</P>

ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>At left is pictured the factory with
produced the 13 Duryeas. In 1898 the brothers went their separate ways and
the Duryea Motor Wagon Company was closed. Charles, who was born in 1861
and was eight years older than Frank had taken advantage of Frank in publicity
and patents. Frank went out on his own and eventually joined with Stevens
Arms and Tool Company to form the Stevens-Duryea Company which was sold
to Westinghouse in 1915. Charles tried to produce some of his own hare-brained
ideas with various companies until 1916. Thereafter he limited himself to
writing technical book and articles. He died in 1938. Frank got a half a
million dollars for the Westinghouse deal and lived in comfort until his
death in 1967, just seven months from his 98th birthday.</P>

HEIGHT="125" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>In this engraving Ransom Eli Olds is
at the tiller of his first petrol powered car. Riding beside him is Frank
G. Clark, who built the body and in the back are their wives. This car was
running by 1896 but production of the Olds Motor Vehicle Company of Detroit
did not begin until 1899. After an early failure with luxury vehicles they
established the first really successful production with the classic Curved
Dash Oldsmobile.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A HREF="oldolds.jpg"><IMG SRC="Oldoldss.jpg" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="136"
ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>The Curved Dash Oldsmobile had a single
cylinder engine, tiller steering and chain drive. It sold for $650. In 1901
600 were sold and the next years were 1902 - 2,500, 1903 - 4,000, 1904 -
5,000. In August 1904 Ransom Olds left the company to form Reo (for Ransom
Eli Olds). <B>Ransom E. Olds was the first mass producer of gasoline powered
automobiles in the United States</B>, even though Duryea was the first auto
manufacturer with their 13 cars.</P>

Lutzmann. This is typical of American design in the mid 1890's. It was truly
a horseless carriage. Tiller steering, engine under the floorboards, very
high center of gravity, not designed for road travel. Imagine climbing into
one of these and trying to drive across town and around a few corners. Kind
of scary, huh?</P>

<P><A HREF="daimlr99.jpg"><IMG SRC="Daimlr9s.jpg" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="75"
ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>This Daimler of 1899 was owned by Lionel
Rothchild. The European design is much advanced of the American designs
of the same time. Gottlieb Daimler took part in the London-to-Brighton run
in 1896 but died in 1900 at the age of 66 without ever meeting Benz. His
German engines powered the automobile industries of Britain and France.</P>

Tarus and the 14 year old 1984 Tarus. Some difference. Old man Haynes claimed
to have build the 1894 car in 1893 but had no proof.</P>

was a six cylinder car that stayed in production until 1925. It represented
the best engineering and technology available at the time and these cars
still run smoothly and silently today. This period marked the end of the
beginning of the automobile.</P>

<H1>How The Car Changed The County, Town by Town</H1>

<P><A HREF="../2-e/2e2764.htm"><IMG SRC="../2-e/2e2764s.jpg" WIDTH="98"
HEIGHT="80" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>In 1903, in Winfield, Kansas
Mr. H. T. Trice is seen standing in from of the first car in town. Acutally
it was more like a truck and was used to haul customers out to see land.
The <A HREF="../winrr/trains.htm">railroads</A> brought potential customers
to town and Mr. Trice picked them up at the <A HREF="../winrr/depots.htm">depot</A>
and took them out to his new developments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A HREF="../3-b/3b1436.htm"><IMG SRC="../3-b/3b1436s.JPG" WIDTH="119"
HEIGHT="80" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Steam power was widely
used in the 1880's and 1890's on the farms of America. Cowley County had
its share of these behemoths and had a large group of people with the ability
to use, and the skill to fix and repair them. The smaller, less expensive
automobile, with an internal combustion engine provided a new avenue of
interest that was much more personal than the steam engine with its team
of attendants.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A HREF="../wortman/mbcar1.jpg"><IMG SRC="../wortman/mbcar1s.JPG" WIDTH=
"143" HEIGHT="80" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Mr. Martin Baden
of Winfield, Kansas and his new eight-cylinder Cadillac roadster. This car
was especially built for <A HREF="../wortman/badenjp1.htm">Mr. Baden</A>,
and was equipped with all modern appliances. Driving an automobile required
a high degree to technical dexterity, mechanical skill, special clothing
including hat, gloves, duster coat, goggles and boots. Tires were notoriously
unreliable and changing one was an excruciating experience. Fuel was a problem,
since gasoline was in short supply. Mr. Baden became interested enough to
become a self-taught geologist and eventually discover major oil deposits
in Cowley County, Kansas, and surrounding area.</P>

<P><A HREF="../winrr/warmrf.htm"><IMG SRC="../winrr/Wamrfzs.JPG" WIDTH=
"124" HEIGHT="80" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>The drivers of the
day were an adventurous lot, going out in every kind of weather, unprotected
by an enclosed body, or even a convertible top. Everyone in town knew who
owned what car and the cars were soon to become each individuals token of
identity. Notice the guy at the far right fixing his flat time. The dirt
roads were a challenge in any weather. By 1910 Winfield paved the downtown
streets with brick, horses were no longer welcome. The mule drawn trolleys
were upgraded to electric streetcars.</P>

<P><A HREF="../winrr/w15fga.htm"><IMG SRC="../winrr/w15fgds.jpg" WIDTH=
"117" HEIGHT="80" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>By 1915 racing had
become a passion all over the United States. A typical local race track
was at the Cowley County Fairgrounds in Winfield, Kansas. The local obsession
with horse racing, started by the earliest settlers in 1870, turned to the
new technology of auto racing. Local farm boys who were familiar with motors
and equipment used their talents on cars and motorcycles to go faster than
anyone in the county.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A HREF="../bl/Racers.htm"><IMG SRC="../bl/Racerss.jpg" WIDTH="155" 
HEIGHT="80" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>The horse racing facilities
were quickly converted to the new, faster, more dangerous, and thus more
exciting, motor racing. See <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/burbaman/main_page.html">Bob
Lawrence's Home Page</A> for new sections on both Auto Racing and Motorcycle
Racing in Cowley County, Kansas</P>

ALIGN="LEFT"></A>Eventually the automobile change the face of small town
America. The <A HREF="../cchm/2b/2b969.jpg.html">town gentry bought cars</A>,
albiet fashoned to match their station in life. In Winfield, Kansas, <A
HREF="../winrr/mainst.htm">Main Street</A> went from a gathering place for
people and horses and wagons to a parking place for the ubiquitous automobile.
The <A HREF="../winrr/trollys.htm">Trolley Car</A>s were displaced to make
room for more cars. The <A HREF="../buffum/w000930/Sat1.html">brick streets</A>
were covered with asphalt to provide a smoother ride for the automobile.
The <A HREF="../winfield/citymaps/byyear/index.html">old fire maps of Winfield</A>
show the inexorable spread of the automobile and all of the supporting businesses.
Filling stations, <A HREF="../cchm/2e/2e154.jpg.html">auto dealers,</A>
battery stations, <A HREF="../cchm/2e/2e237.jpg.html">oil depots</A> all
grew and expanded to displace to older technologies of the day. R. B. Sandford's
<A HREF="../cchm/2e/2e1391.jpg.html">Winfield Carriage Works</A> appears
on the fire-map of <A HREF="../winfield/citymaps/byyear/127-18.htm">Block
127 in 1918</A>. But on the same spot on <A HREF="../winfield/citymaps/byyear/127-25.htm">Block

facility.</P>

WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="120" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Midway through
the century, cars had become a central feature of life for young people.
The <A HREF="../whviking/vikecars/vcars50.htm">cars owned</A> by the students
of Winfield High School in the fifties are typical of every where in America
at that time. It was mobility, status, challenge, and social freedom. It
certainly hurt our football team at the time. A typical excuse for not playing
on the <A HREF="../whviking/vindex.htm">football team</A> was that a student
had to work to earn money to pay for their car. When asked why they needed
a car, the answer was invariably: to get to work!</P>

<P>After a century of the automobile, we can begin to assess the effects
of long term transport by internal combustion. Nearly every aspect of our
lives has developed around this technology. Only now, are we seeing new
digital communications technologies, of the internet and beyond, that may
eventually displace some of the functions of the automobile and replace
our current problems with a new set that you, our grandchildren, will be
charged with solving. Ask your grandparents about their first car. I'm sure
you will get to hear a great story.</P>
