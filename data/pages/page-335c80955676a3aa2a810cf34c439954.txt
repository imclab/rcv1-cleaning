					* Towing capacities shown are maximums and must be reduced by the weight of any passengers, cargo, hitch or optional equipment in the towing vehicle. The following equipment may also be required: load-carrying hitch for trailers under 2000 lb and load-equalizing hitch for trailers over 2000 lb. Towing a trailer will have an effect on the vehicle's handling, braking, durability, performance and driving economy. For specific information on recommended or required equipment, see your Mazda dealer. Hitches are available through manufacturers other than Mazda.<br/>
					
					&#8224; The Bluetooth&#174; system functions only with select manufactured phones. Please consult www.MazdaUSA.com/bluetooth for device compatibility. <br/>
					
					&#8225 EPA-estimated mileage. Actual results may vary.<br/>
					
					
					** Government star rating is based on model year 2010 and is part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA's) New Car Assessment Program (www.safercar.gov). Vehicle tested with standard side-impact air bags (SABs).<br/>
					&#8224;&#8224; Always wear your seat belt and secure children in the rear seats in appropriate child restraints.<br/>
					&#8225&#8225 Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is an electronic system to help the driver maintain control under adverse conditions. It is not a substitute for safe driving practices. Factors including speed, road conditions and driver steering input can all affect whether DSC will be effective in preventing loss of control. Please see the Owner's Manual for further details.<br/>
					
					*** Do not rely completely on the BSM system and be sure to look over your shoulder before changing lanes. The BSM system can assist the driver in confirming the safety of the surrounding but is not a complete substitute. The driver is responsible for assuring lane changes and other maneuvers. Always pay attention to the direction in which the vehicle is traveling and the vehicle's surroundings. The BSM system does not operate when the vehicle speed is lower than about 20 mph (32 km/h).
