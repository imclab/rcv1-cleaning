This car has given me nothing but pleasure since I bought it in 1999, still under warranty, with 55,000 miles on it.  It is in great mechanical condition; I have meticulously maintained and serviced it, and have all receipts/records. No major mechanical or bodywork has been done and it has been garaged off and on since I have owned it.  I am selling because I am getting married; under the condition that I share a newer, bigger car with contemporary safety features (dual airbags, better blind spot visibility, room for enormous dog).  I love this car and it has been my daily drive, but more importantly, my weekend getaway car and good friend for over fourteen years: it loves the highway and still gets 29/MPG there (I replaced the oxygen sensor and pressure sensor last year). As you all know, 1994 was the last year for the convertible in this body style.  The VIN number for the car ends in 000002 ; this is the second one off the line in 1994.  The first one was kept by SAAB in Trollhattan.  Priced to sell.

With 35k+ original miles, there are probably only a handful classic Saab 900 Turbo convertibles in the county with the miles of this one.  Add the more desirable manual transmission/stick and you have a truly incredible classic. It has never seen winter and has no rust. I checked the Carfax when I purchased the car three years ago and everything checked out. It was owned by three owners in two families before I purchased it.  I had the thrust bearing replaced two years ago and I decided to have them replace the whole clutch since it was only $300 more, so it has a new clutch. You can see from the picts that it's in really nice shape. The seats are clean with no cracks. It has Pirellis with low miles. Top is in good shape with no leaks. It includes the convertible top boots. The dash has a few small cracks--maybe 1/2&quot; max and has a bubble in the inset part. Fog lights were broken when shipped on a car transporter.  I have new ones, but haven't installed them. The dash is aftermarket burl wood. There are a few cracks in it. If I were a collector, I would probably replace with the original black vinyl. The weather stripping on the passenger side window could also be replaced. I'm selling because I'm just not using it much--only went through one tank of gas all of last year. It is currently garaged in Lake Geneva, WI (an hour and a half northwest of Chicago). Price is firm and reasonable based on recent eBay and Saabnet sales.  Serious inquires only PLEASE! Feel free to email with questions.

<b>Color:</b> Black <b>Trans:</b> Manual <b>Mileage:</b> 90,300 <b>Price:</b> $9,500<br>
For sale is my 1988 Saab 900 Turbo convertible, “Springtime in Sweden” special edition.  I’ve owned this car for most of its life, driving mostly summer months here in Colorado.  In its first two years the car was owned by a doctor in Arizona.  This is a rust free car.  There have been no accidents, and the car has always been maintained by Saab specialists here in Denver.
The car is all original except for a replacement radio/CD player and a leatherette insert between the rear seat cushions.  A special twin exhaust was installed when the car was sold from the original dealership, providing a fantastic purring sound.  All receipts, records, manuals go with the car.  The 90,000 mile major service appointment was performed at 87,000 miles, with the lubricants changed and belts replaced as needed. Four new Michelin performance tires installed at 83,000 miles.  Front brake pads were just replaced July, 2013. As I was undecided whether to keep my car or to sell, I have just invested in a major repair of the A/C.  I had allowed this repair to be put off for years figuring I always put the top down in summers anyway, but summer temperatures just seem to have climbed over the years and it has become too hot for me to go without A/C any longer.  Thus the repair (July,2013), and now the car is cold in the summer and warm in the winter! See additional photos at https://picasaweb.google.com/117025860910425962180/1988SaabTurboConvertible

<b>Color:</b> Black <b>Trans:</b> Manual <b>Mileage:</b> 162,000 <b>Price:</b> $5000<br>
This car is a 5-speed with 162k miles. Sold new in St.Louis, MO, it lived there until 2008 when I bought it. Since I have owned it, its been stored from October until May and driven on sunny days only. I have the original dash badge, and paperwork from the day of sale in 1988 indicating the model of &quot;900 SPG Convt.&quot;. This car is 100% legit. NOT a copy. The top is perfect, and operates as it should. Leather seats are very nice with no major wear or popped seams. The engine is tight and runs great. The dash has typical small cracks by the speakers and around the recess. This car has factory hi-fi front tweeter speakers, a rare textured hood protection strip, SAAB rubber floor mats, and a VERY rare underseat trashcan that was unavailable in the US, and equally rare Momo 4-spoke steering wheel. Included are 16&quot; Super Aero wheels with very good Nokian NRV 205/50/16 tires, and the original 3-piece hard tonneau cover, in its leather carrying bag. I have driven the car without issue for 4+ summers and it is a pleasure to drive. Issues with the car are below, and should be no major concern for a 900 owner. A/C is not operational. I have replaced every o-ring on all lines, and replaced the A/C dryer, which is still sealed. It is ready to have the dryer opened, the lines connected, a leak test done, and the system charged. Cruise does not work. I have never bothered to chase it. I rarely drive highway. In several spots on the exterior, a poor detailing was done, which burned the paint off several ridges. Below the rear quarter windows on each side are 3-4 SMALL dents. These are pictured and would be fast and easy to repair with a Painless Dent Repair person. Like all 900's, it marks its spot in the garage with a drip or two of oil. The car will need a steering rack eventually; it leaks out the pinion seal. See the below slideshow for 60+ photos. http://s563.photobucket.com/user/parts092405/slideshow/Springtime%20In%20Sweden%20Convt

1991 Saab 900 Turbo Convertible for sale by second female owner and non-smoker car.  The car is the very unusal Eucalyptus Green with Grey leather interior, black top, ABS, airbag, heated power seats and power mirrors.  It has 116k, it's mechanically in very good condition, new battery last summer, four new tires last summer.  I have owned it for almost 10 years and have only put on about 2,000 miles if that much.  Only been used in summer on nice days.  It has been garaged kept most of the time or covered outside  It has been maintained with proper oil changes, wiper blades and fluid and brake checks.  The paint is gorgeous, the top is in very good condition as well as the interior in very good condition.  The driver seat has a little bit of wear but no tears.  The top is automatic and is working, the back window is glass.  The A/C worked last season but needs charging.  The turbo is very strong on it.  Back in 2007 I had the transmission and differential rebuilt.  The dash has a few cracks which were there when I purchases it.  It has its original black plastic boot.  This car has never been in an accident since I've owned it and I just got it inspected.  This car has been really taken care of and I'm selling it as I have no space for the proper storage of it and don't want it to get ruined.  Any questions, please contact me and for additional pics.

Enjoy the rest of the summer in this very nice, low mileage 94 turbo convertible - the last of the &quot;classic&quot; body style. Green with tan interior, including original Clarion stereo and separate CD player/equalizer. Body is very clean, with no rust and only 2 very minor dings. Interior is very clean too, with leather in excellent shape, original plastic parade boot, and only minor cracks in dash. Second owner, with all records since 98. New convertible top and head gasket last year, and only 18K miles on tires. Brakes and clutch have been replaced too (all work done by Swedish Auto Factory), so car should have years of good, reliable, and most importantly fun tops down, daily driving left!<br clear="left">

Up for sale is a well kept, rust free, Southern Californian 1988 Saab SPG
Convertible / Black on Black w/ 162,000 original miles.  3rd owner. First
100,000 miles owned by Saab Dealer in Los Angeles.  Have owned the vehicle for
13 years, and have, over that time, nurtured it back to original running status.
 But alas, there's a new love in my life; a 2007 Saab Aero convertible, and
unfortunately, have to part ways. A partial list of some of those most recent
items are as follows:  New Michelin Primacy MXV4 tires, New Bosch Battery, New
Starter Motor, Rear Bike Rack Hitch, Wind Screen, New Windshield, New Muffler,
Tailpipe & Catalytic Converter. In addition, over the last 8 years, I have had
the Transmission completely overhauled, replaced all the carpets, new Saab Floor
Mats, and  replaced the top. Had a new Dash Board installed, ( with no cracks),
along with a new speedometer.    A Blaupunkt Heidelberg CD player with iPod
adaptor, along with a Kenwood 150 watt amp with Boston Acoustic Speaker System
where added.  The Turbo was replaced at 88,000 miles, by the original owner. 
And Oil and Filter where religiously changed every 2,000 miles. One great
running, daily driver, that still turns heads.  A beautiful example of a Saab
SPG 900 Convertible.  A complete PDF file of all repairs and service records is
available.

This is the 3RD S.P.G I've owned. Love them. I'm the second owner of this
vehicle, owned for the last 6 years adding approx. 21k miles, only driven
seasonally. Have receipts from previous owner dating back to 1991 and for the
last 6years. All the essential things done by either myself or by Mecca Motors
of Boston, a Known Saab repair shop. They just replaced the rear calipers
3-19-2013...getting it back on the road for 2013. No known mechanical issues.
Garaged or covered during the winter. Original paint, a little fade on the front
hood. Upgraded radio with usb &amp; ipod connection(have original). No accident
history. Car in good shape.....Dash has cracks(bought a dash cover 4yrs ago
never installed) Minor fender rust (I slightly rolled fender) and some at the
bottom of the door, but overall great car.

<font size="+2"><B>The Vehicle..........1994 Saab 900S Convertible in green metallic with a tan leather interior and 144K miles. This is a SOLID CAR and RUNS VERY WELL. It has a CLEAN CARFAX report. Features include the 2 liter non-turbocharged 4 cylinder engine, automatic transmission, power convertible top, power steering and brakes, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, power seats, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, delay wipers, aftermarket am-fm-CD stereo, and much more. This is a solid PROJECT car. You can drive it home, but it is not ready for daily use. It's Condition..........PROJECT CAR! This car was traded to the Village Auto Group on a new car. It starts, runs very well, drives around the parking lot (that’s as far as I tested it), and looks very good for its age. The engine runs smoothly with no skips, noises, or vibrations. The transmission shifts slowly but it does shift. I think it needs fluid, but I can’t get the hood open to check. The hood latch is disconnected from the cable. All the other mechanical systems seem fine. The convertible top is in EXCELLENT condition and goes up and down perfectly in less than 10 seconds! The interior needs work on the seat recline motors. It has power everything, but the seat recline motors don’t work properly. There are no other significant problems with the interior. The paint and body are very good for a 94 Saab. There are no dents, rotted areas, or serious scratches anywhere on the body. The paint appears all original and is faded is some areas. This is a PROJECT car that will need work to be safe, dependable and comfortable. But it is a very solid car that can be brought back to excellent condition without too much work. If you love these 1st generation Saab convertibles and want to restore one, this is a GREAT car to start with.</B></font>

Purchased last February with 197k. Starts up great every time. Battery doesn't drain, no issues there. Gets about 25 mpg average. I shortened the front springs to level car out, but I went a tad far. I might correct this before the car is sold. Very little rust on the car. Has a tiny patch of bubbling between the hood and windshield but that's it. I haven't had it on a lift to do a full inspection, but when I worked on the front suspension/brakes everything looked fairly solid. Top is newer and works great. New parts since I bought it - Outer axles, upper &amp; lower control arm ball joints, front rotors &amp; pads, ignition coil, distributor cap &amp; rotor, spark plug wires, FPR, fuel pump, fuel filter. Main issue with the car is it needs inner axles. More info here http://www.saabcentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=257425

One owner, garaged entire life, limited winter driving, meticulously cared for,
new tires, original paint, 2nd top, convertible boot. Car's shifting, steering,
braking, turbo, clutch and transmission as good as it gets for a '94. Car's
"bells and whistles" still perform at 100%; for example: cruise control, remote
electric door locks, stainless steel exhaust. Serviced meticulously by mechanics
of Charles River Saab in Watertown, Massachusetts and by only one mechanic since
their doors closed. Pre-sale inspection by reputable mechanic not a problem.
Price just reduced by $1,250. This is a GREAT CAR and hate to say good-bye to a
trusted friend! We have decided to sell upon just inheriting my son's family's
cars upon their decision to move to Europe for longterm work.

1989 Saab 900 Turbo convertible in Beryl Green with almost flawless
interior. She's a gem; I'm selling her because I just bought the same car in
grey and I drive so little, I can't have two! Mileage 101k. Manual transmission,
power windows & mirrors, external SPG 'kit'.  Comes with the convertible boot.
Maintained for past 5 years by my EOS Motorsports in Boulder since 2008 when I
bought her at 80k miles from a friend. No rust. CD/radio stereo, new windshield
with no cracks; driver's side seat heater works! Exterior in excellent
condition, just a few little dings. Newish (6 yrs old) black top works great (no

Classic first model ever produced and a nice bait car for you know who, yes you. You can't find it in this color anymore and it has a silver plated catalytic converter and an oven. Can be converted to camper or storage unit. Has wifi. It should not be obvious that this is scammer bait.

Been looking for that perfect true collectible edition classic 900 turbo? Up for your consideration is my 1988 900 Springtime in Sweden turbo convertible with only 21,800 miles. Saab produced just 288 of these limited edition turbo convertibles, one for each dealer in the US market at that time. Vehicle has not been restored or had any paint or bodywork. I have really enjoyed this collectible 900 over the last six years of ownership, I am the second owner. The only reason for sale is a business transition from exclusively Saab to include Porsche service and repair. Please request additional photos and a copy of an Autocheck report. I can be reached at the number below or via email to answer any questions you have about this truly exceptional classic 900. Thank you.

California car, low miles.  Only two owners, I bought it in '98 have had it ever since.  The top has been retro fitted with the stiffer bracket, and has worked flawlessly since, for years.  Just treated the top for waterproofing last fall.  Runs great, strong, have CARFAX report.  Have additional pictures if interested.  I swore I'd keep this one until I kick the bucket, but kids in college shifted my priorities.  Will you be #3?

For Sale: My Stage 3 Tuned Saab 900 SE Turbo Convertible.
VIN ys3df75n7s7020617. This is a great car to drive (about 240 BHP with the upgrades) but I have a new car on the way and no space to keep this one. I bought this in 2005 with 50,000 miles on the clock. I have detailed below everything I can think of but please feel free to ask me specific questions and I will gladly answer them. I have nothing to hide here! Ideally a Saab enthusiast will take this car and finish what I started with the upgrades. Upgrades: Trionic 5 ECU Tuning Stage 3, Taliaferro 3in downpipe. Full stainless Tig welded with Metallic Race Catalyst. $457 new, BSR 2.5in Catback exhaust. Stainless and chrome Steel construction. $383 new, K&amp;N air filter, Taliaferro short shifter; throw is reduced from 5in to 3-3/8 inches. $140 new
Taliaferro Rear Anti-Roll (anti Sway) Bar. $90 new. The car is nearly 20 years old so paint is showing signs of age, driver's seat is worn, dome light is loose, there is a rattle from the roof frame when open, one fog lamp is broken. I had a new roof fitted within the last 4 years (can't remember the exact date) and it is immaculate. Also it goes up and down smoothly.
