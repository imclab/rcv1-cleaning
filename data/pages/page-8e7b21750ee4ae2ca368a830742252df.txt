very young</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding Picture Book
Language</span></big></p>

      <big>There
has been a great debate within the realm of children's literature as to
the
function of picture books, for although many presume that the function
of
picture in picture books is to help children to read this is not a
proper
function. There is after all some evidence that pictures only distract
a child
from the words, making it harder for them to learn how to read. To
further
complicate things pictures are themselves complicated and multilayer in
meaning. Nodleman in his book "Words About Pictures" pointed out that
not only do the meanings of pictures change but the ability to see them
varies from
culture to culture. It <span style="">&nbsp;</span>has
long been
known by those who study cultures, that those pictures which seems
clear to one
group may be confusing to another. </big>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>Goodnew
and Levine (1973) for example found that composition and the way
composition is
seen varies from culture to culture. Much of the way pictures are seen
depends
on the way in which the people of a culture read and write. Children
however
are unable to read or write so how they view pictures would be vastly
different
from the way the most skilled artists create them. Further many of the
illusions we see are a result of learning and education. Deregowski
(1972)
found that people without formal schooling where often unable to see
the
illusionary and perspective effects within pictures. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>For
all these reasons it is presumed then that seeing pictures is a learned
ability
and so what they do for children is minimal. However Jon M Kennedy in A
Psychology of Picture Perception showed that even animals can recognize
various
pictures, and they did not learn such traits such things where inborn
into
them. Deregowski (1972) found in studies that people from any culture
could
interpret many pictures with enough thought, again showing that this
ability is
at least inborn in us. So why is it people from different cultures have
trouble
understanding pictures?&nbsp;</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>In
psycholinguistics researchers have found that many of the aspects which
allow
us to speak all languages are wired into our brains from birth. However
was we
never hear the phonemes from a language these are lost as the ones from
the
languages we do hear grow larger.&nbsp;Like language the ability to
understand
visual stimulus such as the pictures within a picture book is partly in
born,
however like the phonemes of a language never heard this understanding
can be
lost or altered. For example in other studies psychologists found that
if a kitten
was prevented from seeing vertical lines it would loose the ability to
see
these (Blakemore and Cooper 1970) The kittens who never saw vertical
lines then
would run into vertical objects such as bars, as they could not see
these.</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>So it is with pictures, when
a persons brain
is exposed to pictures they develop the ability to see such pictures
properly.
Picture books in this way can be though of as a language, a means by
which to
teach children to be able to see pictures, and to expand their ability
to do
so.&nbsp;The function of picture books for this reason can be
thought of as a
way to teach children the language of art, and illustration. In many
ways our
society uses this language as extensively as verbal languages, from
instructional video&rsquo;s to magazine layouts and the internet,
we utilize visual
cues in order to gain a better understanding of things faster, and to
help make
life more enjoyable. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>Of
course much of the understanding of pictures does come fairly quickly,
like
sign language children can learn visual languages faster then spoken or
written
languages. After all larger portions of our brain are devoted to
interpreting
visual stimulus and so we can come to interpret these more quickly. For
this
reason children respond almost instantly to picture books, because as
visual
creatures picture books speak to us on a very basic level. Further for
very
young children picture books can offer new tactile sensations, as will
as the opportunity
to have their parents discuss pictures with them. Such discussions are
helpful
to the young child&rsquo;s development as it has been found that
children who where
read to more have better language skills on entering preschool. Picture
books
therefore are a means by which parents can discuss visuals with a child
in a
meaningful and easy to understand way, even as the child learns both
story
elements and the visual language of art.</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>This
is important because much a persons intelligence is developed before
the age of
8, and even the youngest children's brains are growing and making
determinations about the world around them. One should therefore very
the
child's experiences while also giving them lots of social and
discussion time.</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>It
can be said the function of pictures in picture books are much the same
as the
function of text, to provide the child an opportunity to learn the
visual
language. Also pictures provide parents a point of interesting
discussion with
the child, what is often forgotten with picture books is that before
the child
can read they are not the reader of the picture book or the primary
interpreter, their parents, teachers, older siblings, etc are the
primary
readers. These people discuss the pictures in a picture book with the
child and
so the child is able to understand the pictures better then one would<span style="">&nbsp; </span>think they should.</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>One
thing that keeps children from developing an interest in picture books
is that
for many adults picture books can be boring despite the fact that they
provide
social time with their child, after all children are amused by some of
the
strangest things in the books, and love the repetitions in the book, or
in
reading a book over and over again. Parents however should keep in mind
that it
is repetitiveness and interest which help to drive a child&rsquo;s
learning. Such
potential boredom with picture books helps to bring up another
important point
about them, this is that high quality picture books should also provide
some
interest for those who are older then children as will. After all much
of the
greatest entertainment for children is actually family entertainment.
Movies
have already discovered this, and so many of these such as "Finding
Nemo" have many variables in meaning, as while as artwork which would
appeal to anyone. So although picture books need to appeal to children,
having
story points they can understand and pictures they would love, they
should also
be geared towards others, with story points for older people and
pictures
nearly anyone would like. For picture books are read to children, and
so these
stories impact and are impacted by older brothers reading to little
sisters,
aunts reading to nephews, fathers reading to sons, and preschool
teachers
reading to a dozen children.&nbsp;</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>This
understanding that picture books are often read to children brings up
another
reason that children&rsquo;s literature is so often picture books.
This is that those
reading picture books often do not like to read long stories, however
the story
has to be full in order to capture and keep their attention and build
the
literary intelligence of the child. A picture provides a means to add
more
information with out having to add a lot of text, because once a child
learns
to understand the visual language they will be able to see
descriptions,
events, ideas, emotions, and more in the illustrations of the picture
book.</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>Great
picture books are those which speak to both parents and children. This
is
because one of the main reasons children don&rsquo;t learn to love
literature is that
a parent might get bored reading a picture books. Picture books then
are not
for young children so much as they are for people within groups. The
great
movies for children have discovered this as will, thus the reason for
companies
like Pixar&rsquo;s great success. Many picture books have learned
to tell stories to
adults as well, through their imagery and their beautiful interplay of
text and
pictures these stories have become fun for adults as well. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>Picture
books speak to the audience very differently for other literature, for
while
most literature is limited to only words to tell stories, picture book
utilize images.
In our society pictures, and visual cues have become another language,
one
which we all know surprisingly well, even when we aren&rsquo;t
thinking about it.
This is the interesting thing about illustrations, that often times
they tell a
story without the person reading them knowing it. Some have presumed
that the
fact that they are not aware of what critics and visual theorists say
makes
these things unimportant, or untrue. However the difference between a
good
picture book and a poor one often hinges on the way the pictures tell a
story
many people are not overtly aware of.</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>The
illustrations in picture books have many methods of telling stories, a
good
example<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of how
picture books tell
stories is found in the Wiesner&rsquo;s 2007 Caldecott winner
&ldquo;Floatsom.&rdquo; Wiesner has
won three Caldecotts, two for wordless picture books. Having no text in
the
picture book makes it much easier to see and understand the way in
which the
illustrations are communicating to the readers, and with a master like
Wiesner
one sees how this is done well. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>In
Floatsom Wiesner tells much of the story through sequence, within the
picture
book sequence is very important to meaning, because as humans we are
skilled at
watching visual events unfold in order to understand a story. As the
protagonist
of the picture book becomes excited to get pictures developed the
number of
pictures in the sequence increases to build energy. The hand off of the
film to
the girl working at the counter requires two pictures, by showing her
less
interested in the second picture Wiesner<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>has given the viewer the opportunity to contrast the
two character, his
interest, passion, and excitement, verse her more jaded outlook on
life. As
this story is about discovering wonder this contrast is important to
the
overall message and theme of the picture book. Then as the main
character waits
for film to be developed Wiesner uses multiple pictures of the same
shot,
letting the viewers see the passage of time.</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>In
&ldquo;Blue Berries for Sal&rdquo; McCloskey illustrates a
sequence of events regarding the
human mother and her daughter Sal. McCloskey then illustrates the same
sequence
of events with the bears. Textually what each says is fairly different,
though
both are coming to gather blue berries for the winter, the bears and
humans
have drastically different thoughts about how to go about this. The
text in
this case supports and divides the illustrations, allowing the
viewers/readers
of the picture book to see the connection between the characters
quickly. While
allowing for a more direct understanding of the contrast between and
relationship
between their lives and ideas. The matched sequence in
McCloskey&rsquo;s story also
lets the reader know that these two sets of characters are going to
meet up. So
with a simple sequence McCloskey has provided his simple story with
foreshadowing as will as with additional thoughts to ponder. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>Composition
of the Illustration</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>Part
of what makes McCloskey&rsquo;s sequence of drawings work so well
is the composition
of the pictures which he draws. He has the mom and the girl walking
from page
left to right while he also has the bears walking from page right to
left. This
lets us know that these two are heading towards each other. Further
when each
set of characters is headed home they head back the way they came,
allowing the
viewers to visually know that they are leaving the meeting world, the
place
where humans and nature come together for food and going back to the
place they
came from.</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>The
picture book Owl Moon illustrated by John Schoenherr utilizes
composition for a
similar purpose, allowing the readers to see the characters moving into
the
woods, and seeing them walk home. It is interesting to note however
that when
the protagonists of the story finally do get to spot an owl they spot
it in the
same direction home is. By having the characters face home rather then
the
wilderness Schoenherr is drawing in the connection between the force of
nature
and the humans in its realm. This is done quickly so that there can be
only a
few pictures of the owl itself, in order to build anticipation for the
moment
they see the owl. The Owl Moon also utilizes broad negative space to
both ad
energy to the figures and to make the background as still as it would
be on the
moonlit night in which the story takes place. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>Sendak
utilizes composition in his master piece &ldquo;Where the Wild
Things Are.&rdquo; This book
tells the story of a boy as he heads out into the wild of his mind. As
his
fantasy grows and grows the pictures within the book grow larger and
larger,
then as the boy (Max) leaves his imaginary world to return home the
pictures
grow smaller and smaller. The story in this way tells both of the vast
size of
the mind and the intimacy of home. Something that is reinforced by the
fact
that dinner is waiting for Max on his return home. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>Distance
of the characters</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>The
Owl Moon like so many other picture books also utilizes apparent
distance from
objects and characters as a means of telling the story. In this picture
book
the figures draw closer and closer as they enter and ultimately connect
with
nature by calling out for the owl. When the owl doesn&rsquo;t come,
and after it
leaves the apparent distance from the characters grows larger. In this
book
then we are lead to understand that the father and child grow closer to
each
other as they grow closer to nature. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>Molly
Bang in her picture book &ldquo;Goose&rdquo; does something
similar, though in her book
distance is meant to show the depression and isolation of being alone,
and the
joy of being with and returning to ones family. In Krykarka&rsquo;s
&ldquo;A Promise is a
Promise&rdquo; Distance is used in a different way with the pushing
in close to the
characters representing fear, much as with would in film. This closer
proximity
to the characters draws viewers into their fear and so heightens the
sense of
danger and tension. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>McCloskey
in &ldquo;Make Way for Ducklings&rdquo; utilizes distance as a
means of giving details,
letting the viewers see the a bike headed for the ducklings before they
do,
then showing the readers the bike nearly hitting them up close in order
to pull
the viewers into the sense of danger the mother duckling feels at that
moment. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>Style
in the Picture Book</big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>One
of the first things that readers of picture books will notice is the
style of
art the illustrator chose to utilize in creating the book. Style is a
very
important aspect of the story, altering its mood greatly. The black and
white
stippling work done by Van Alsburg in Zathura is reminiscent of
television
fuzz, a left over form the big bang. This lets the reader know
immediately on
reading t5he title that this is a science fiction style book.
What&rsquo;s more the story
seems to call back to the begging for wisdom. In this case this is that
one
should be nice to their little brothers. This is seemingly in contrast
with Ban
Allsburg&rsquo;s similar tale Jumangi, which has smooth highly
rendered graphite
drawings. These drawings are so realistic in the Western Artistic
understanding
that they become surreal. This stories visual style along with the
other
elements of the picture book seems to say that one should be careful
not to let
their dreams take control of them. At the same time by not showing the
faces of
any adults in the book Van Allsburg makes the story a privet dream for
children. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>In
some senses the meaning of Jumangi and Zathura are similar, in Zathura
however
the older brother learns that his younger brothers dreams will impact
him even
if the he ignores the younger brother. This picture book then is about
imagining along with those close to you. </big></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><big>In
a very different style of picture book &ldquo;Knuffle Bunny
Too&rdquo; by Mo Williams, the
reader is treated to drawings that allude to the Saturday morning
cartoon,
helping to insure that this picture book will be light hearted, fun,
and funny.</big> </p>
