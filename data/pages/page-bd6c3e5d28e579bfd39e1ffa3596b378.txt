				<h1>Lauren Conrad</h1>
				<p>Lauren Conrad was born on February 1, 1986 in Newport Beach, California. Her family later moved to Laguna Beach. Lauren has always been considered the nice girl out of all her friends and was voted Most Irresistible by her senior classmates at Laguna Beach High School. During her high school years she also served on the Student Body Governing Council similar so what is known as student council at most schools. In her free time she enjoys shopping, eating out, going to the beach, being with friends and fashion design.</p> 
<p>Lauren was the main character in season one of Laguna Beach. Her career started when MTV came to Laguna Beach High School and chose to cast her and her group of friends to be the stars of the new reality show Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. Her life with her friends and at home were documented by the MTV cameras and ended up aiding in the breakthrough of a hit show for MTV. Lauren was the narrator of the first season of Laguna Beach and became an idol to many girls across the US. At the end of the season Lauren graduated and set off to San Francisco, California to attend Academy of Art University to major in fashion design. She soon found out that she was not cut out for San Francisco and decided to move back to Laguna Beach because she was homesick.</p> 
<p>Lauren then chose to star in season two of Laguna Beach after she graduated from Laguna Beach High school and allowed the cameras to continue to follow her for another year. During this season Lauren received an internship in Los Angeles, California at Three Dots clothing company. She still had feelings for Stephen throughout the season, up until she became attracted to Jason Wahler. The two hooked-up near the end of the season and the broke up. The couple is now currently back together. Lauren iis currently attending college at The Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (FIDM) and lives in Los Angeles. 
"The Hills: Season 2" is currently airing on MTV.</p>

Just when it seemed like the drama was dying down, leave it to the girls of "The Hills" to revv up their engines for another season. The premier followed Lauren as she finally ended her relationship with scuzzbucket Jason, got chewed out by her boss at Teen Vogue for turning down a trip to Paris, and attended the opening of Bolthouse hotspot Area in Hollywood. The screen really started to sizzle with a pregnancy scare for Heidi, who is dating extreme womanizer Spencer. Can't wait to see what happens as this season heats up!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Jun 24 2013 in Beverly Hills, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed leaving lunch at The Grill in Beverly Hills on June 24, and the former reality TV star did her best to shield her face from the photogs while rocking her ombre locks (which even seem to have a hint of pink on the ends). For her lunchtime outfit, Lauren started with a white top (like Bailey 44's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/bailey-44/reaction-time-top-in-white/product.html">Reaction Time Top in White</a>) tucked into a blue mid-calf skirt (TYSA's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tysa/flutter-skirt-in-sky-/product.html">Flutter Skirt in Sky</a> is very similar), and then wore a pair of tortoise Wayfarers and toted an ivory shoulder bag. A pair of tan strappy wedges (for two similar options, check out either Dolce Vita's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/dolce-vita/jury-wedges-in-nude-/product.html">Jury Wedges in Nude</a> or Bed Stu's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/bed-stu/julie-platform-in-nectar-/product.html">Julie Platform in Nectar</a>) added the perfect finishing touch to Lauren's casual street style ensemble. What are your thoughts on LC's look here, friends? In other Lauren news, the blonde starlet recently wrote on her official website about her beauty travel tips, saying: "<I>When Im hopping on a different plane every day, the first place I see it take a toll is on my skin. Between disrupted sleep patterns and stale airplane air, my skin can go from great to bad in a matter of hours. Throughout my years of book tours and cross-country business trips, I have found that its nearly impossible to maintain a consistent beauty and skincare routine when traveling. Luckily, there are a few products and tips I rely on that truly save my skin.</i>" Lauren then went on to discuss specific products, which you can head over to LaurenConrad.com to read all about. What about you, do you have any top travel and beauty tips you wish to share?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 28 2012 in West Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed on her way to film an appearance on "EXTRA" at The Grove in West Hollywood on November 28, looking quite festive as she donned Lot 78's "Ho! Ho! Ho!" sweater for her on-camera interview. For a similarly graphic sweater that's wearable year-round, put your heart on your sleeve, er, chest with WIldfox Couture's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/wildfox-couture/bianca-jagger-in-sky-/product.html">Bianca Jagger in Sky</a>.

What are your thoughts on LC's festive look, friends? In other Lauren news, the modern day style icon recently chatted with <i>Stylecaster</i> about who her style icons are, saying: "<I>Theres not one person that I say I want to look like. When were pulling up photos for inspiration, we tend to pull photos from years and years ago. Were more likely to pull a photo of Audrey Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot as opposed to something off a website from today.</i>" When asked what one of her recent splurges was, Lauren replied: "<I>My mom was a great bargain hunter, which I love because it kind of taught me how to dress high and low. I love wearing designer pieces with something I found at Target. But I recently splurged on a Goyard leather carry on. You dont have to check it, and you can wear it at the airport with a T-shirt and jeans and it still looks great because it pulls the whole outfit together!</i>" Very cute!</p>

I'm [also very] excited for the weather to change so I can finally wear some of it, because I've gotten some really great boots.

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 24 2012 in Los Angeles, CA. <B>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed at her latest "The Fame Game" book signing at The Grove in LA on April 24, sporting a new hairstyle - freshly dyed fuchsia tips! Conrad's  hairstylist Kristin Ess dubbed this new look "fuchsia Barbie," and Lauren seems to be quite pleased. Outfit wise, LC donned a cute ensemble consisting of a sleeveless collared shirt and flouncy skirt, a trademark Chanel tote and white strappy sandals. Emulate Lauren's look here by either pairing Zoa's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/zoa-ltd/tied-and-tabbed-sleeveless-blouse-in-white/product.html">Tied and Tabbed Sleeveless Blouse in White</a> with Nanushka's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nanushka/amber-skirt-/product.html">Amber Skirt in Golden Blue</a>, and then add on a delicate ring like Lauren did. Opt for Avanessi's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/avanessi/knot-ring-/product.html">Knot Ring in Rose Gold</a>. Alternatively, you could try a classic white shirt dress, such as Tysa's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tysa/traveller-shirt-in-white-/product.html">Traveller Shirt in White</a>. What are your thoughts on Lauren's look here - and more importantly, her new 'do - everyone? Lauren recently chatted with Ryan Seacrest about her new book, and said: "<I>I took the mean girl from the first series and spun her off which was really fun, because the first series I was writing from my own point of view. However, this girl is just the complete opposite. She loves being famous. Thats all she ever wanted, and she does all the shameless things that people do. It was fun to play that character. I know so many people like that!</i>" Sounds like it could be based on a lot of people Lauren knows!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 04 2012 in Ridgewood, NJ. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted smiling and waving for fan's at a signing for her latest book, "The Fame Game," that was held at Bookends bookstore in Ridgewood, NJ on April 4. For her book signing ensemble, Lauren chose Heartloom's Athena Maxi Dress (for two similar options, check out T-Bags' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/t-bags/smocked-tube-dress-/product.html">Smocked Tube Dress</a> and Hard Tail's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/hard-tail/maxi-tank-dress-in-multi/product.html">Maxi Tank Dress in Multi</a>) that she paired with gold Anita Ko bracelets (like Calico Juno Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/calico-juno-designs/bracelet-28/product.html">Bracelet 28 in Gold</a>) and a pair of nude Casadei platforms (which can't been seen in these pics). Do you think this look could have benefited from a dainty necklace, such as Satya Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/satya-jewelry/silver-bless-your-heart-necklace/product.html">Silver Bless Your Heart Necklace in Turquoise</a>? Overall, this look is classic Lauren - girly and effortless. Now that she's on her book tour, Lauren has been doing tons of interviews to promote "The Fame Game." When speaking to <i>The Charlotte Observer</i> about how she deals when people say that it probably wasn't her who actually wrote the book (and instead a ghost writer), Lauren said: "<I>You have to take it as it comes. I take it as a compliment. When they tell you they didn't think you could do it, you prove you can. ... I really wanted to get younger girls to read. I remember never wanting to read growing up, but there were a few (books) that I could really get lost in. If you can ever get a young person to pick up a book and read it, that's great.</i>" Interesting!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Jan 21 2012 in Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was caught leaving Hollywood hot dog joint Papaya King on January 21, and didn't seem to be too pleased to spy the paparazzi as she dashed to her car. Lauren has proved herself to be somewhat of a hair chameleon, as she's never afraid to take risks with changing her hair color and style. On this occasion, Lauren opted for light pink tips which she achieved with chalk! But more about that in a minute. Outfit wise, Lauren chose a dove grey silk blouse with shoulder cutouts (for something similar, try Luc by Lucy's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/luc-by-lucy/soft-whisper-button-down/product.html">Soft Whisper Button Down in Stone</a>; Soul Revival's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/soul-revival/marcy-top-in-fuchsia-/product.html">Marcy Top in Fuchsia</a> also has shoulder cutouts, if that's what you're attracted to in Lauren's top) that she paired with simple black skinny jeans (try Rich & Skinny's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/rich-and-skinny/rich-and-skinny-rider-jean/product.html">Rider Skinny Jean in Black Vintage Wash</a>, which are currently on sale for $84!) and one of her numerous Chanel bags. A pair of strappy wedges and a delicate silver bracelet (like Avanessi's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/avanessi/knot-bangle-/product.html">Knot Bangle in White Gold</a>) completed LC's 'fit. What are you feeling about this look - and hair - on Lauren? Conrad's hairstylist Kristin Ess dished to <i>InStyle</i> that she achieved the look on Lauren with nothing more than pink chalk. Say what? Ess even posted a tutorial on TheBeautyDepartment.com, her site with Lauren. Click <a href="http://thebeautydepartment.com/2012/01/chalk-it-up/#more-5255">here</a> to check it out, and let me know - would you ever try this trend?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Jan 10 2012 in Hollywood, CA. Photographed leaving Katsuya in Hollywood on January 10, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> seemed to be a bit shy and tried shielding her face from the ever-present paparazzi. I always find it funny when celebs act like they don't want to get their picture taken when they're leaving Katsuya, especially when paparazzi pretty much camp out in front of the restaurant! You don't want your photo taken? There's about 1,000 other sushi restaurants in LA that the paparazzi don't frequent. Just a tip! For her sushi ensemble, Lauren paired a high waisted cream colored skirt (for something similar, check out Joie's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/joie/lotus-skirt-/product.html">Lotus Skirt in New Moon</a>) with a black camisole (try Soul Revival's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/soul-revival/amy-cami-in-black-/product.html">Amy Cami in Black</a>) and  classic black blazer (you can't go wrong with Elizabeth & James' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/elizabeth-and-james/cate-blazer/product.html">Cate Blazer in Black</a>), and then donned a pair of studded black lace-up booties and carried a black tote with gold chain detailing. A menswear-inspired watch and gold double finger ring (take a look at Erica Anenberg's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/erica-anenberg/cosmo-sparkle-twosome/product.html">Cosmo Sparkle Twosome Ring in Gold/Clear</a>) finished off LC's 'fit. What are your thoughts, readers - good or bad style choice for Lauren on this night? In other Lauren news, the former "Hills" star allegedly ran into ex-fling Derek Hough at popular LA hotspot Beacher's Madhouse. According to <i>People</i>: "<I>Lauren was fairly reserved, dancing occasionally to the music. But she seemed giddy when he approached her table around midnight, giving him a huge hug hello and touching his face with her hands. Though they were friendly throughout the evening, it didn't appear like they were rekindling anything romantically.</i>" That's nice that there was no awkwardness between the two!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Jan 05 2012 in West Hollywood, CA. <B>Lauren Conrad</b> was snapped heading to the Kate Somerville Spa in West Hollywood on January 5, giving the paparazzi a friendly wave before indulging in a few beauty treatments. For her spa ensemble, Lauren slipped into a pair of cropped ankle jeggings (Bleulab's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/bleulab/rotate-porkchop-crop-in-bleulead-wash-/product.html">Rotate Porkchop Crop in Bleulead Wash</a> are great if you're looking for a cropped pair) and then wore a black tank (add a little extra glitz with Ani Apparel's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/ani/pocket-tank-/product.html">Pocket Tank in Black</a>) with a cute striped cardigan (check out Michael Lauren's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/michael-lauren/wide-stripe-wrap-in-heather-grey-/product.html">Wide Stripe Wrap in Heather Grey</a>).

Lauren's street style is always polished and pretty - what are your thoughts of this look, readers? Lauren recently divulged her New Year's Resolutions on her blog, and they included: sending more thank you notes, making an effort to plan a dinner with my friends once a week, and organizing my closet once a month. Those sound good to me, especially writing more thank you notes. Manners are so important! How does LC plan to make sure she sticks to these resolutions? Well, she said: "<I>I made sure my resolutions are things that can be measured or checked off. They are all realistic and definitely attainable. I did this because whenever I make vague resolutions like, Take more chances! they end up being grandiose statements, which I never follow through with.</i>" She continued: "<I>I am going to re-read them once a month by setting a reminder on my phone. I dont know if this is the best idea. It will probably get annoying. At least this way I wont be able to escape them until theyve been accomplished</i>." Ha! Let's hope she sticks with them.</p>

Making an appearance at the launch of the video game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim that was held at the Belasco Theatre in LA on November 8, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> opted for a cute and sophisticated outfit for her night out.

Is this look on Lauren a winner in your eyes, everyone? Lauren has been enjoying the single life quite a bit recently, as it has been reported that now that things have cooled down with Derek Hough, Lauren has been spotted with Chace Crawford! According to spies inside LA's Voyeur Nightclub, the former "Hills" cutie and "Gossip" guy were "making out" and later "hooked up" at mutual pal Shawn Pyfrom's house. While neither Lauren or Chace's reps will confirm whether or not this is true or not, I think that these two would definitely make a cute couple. What about you? Can you see LC and CC coupled up?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 26 2011 in West Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> attended the 2nd Annual Autumn Party featuring a fashion show by Yigal Azrouel benefiting the Children's Institute that was held at The London Hotel in West Hollywood on October 26, and looked sweet and shimmery as she smiled on the red carpet. In a champagne colored sequined dress (for two similar options, check out Halston Heritage's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/halston-heritage/halston-heritage-tank-dress/product.html">Tank Dress in Golden</a> or Mark & James by Badgley Mischka's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/mark-and-james-by-badgley-mischka/mark-and-james-by-badgley-mischka-sequin-dress/product.html">Sequin Dress in Cream</a>) with a pair of nude peep toe pumps, Lauren toted an oversized nude clutch which, in my opinion, is too large to carry on the red carpet and - let's get real - kind of looks like a paper bag. For a more vibrant option, go for a pop of color with Julie K Handbags' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/julie-k-handbags/callie-in-red-cobra-/product.html">Callie in Red Cobra</a>.

Is this look a winner on Lauren, everyone? As those of you who are LC fans know, the former "Hills" star already offered up her fashion advice in her book "Lauren Conrad Style" - however, now Lauren is set to dish on beauty in the just-announced book "Lauren Conrad Beauty." Says Lauren: "<I>I am working on a new book: 'Lauren Conrad BEAUTY'! Like 'Lauren Conrad Style', my beauty book will be your ultimate guide for all things beauty. In it, I'll provide my personal insights, instructions and tips to keep you looking glamorous 365 days a year. I'll address everything from how your diet affects skincare and fun hairstyles for a night out to one simple thing you can do each day to freshen up your look.</i>" Anyone interested in checking out Lauren's beauty tome?

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 17 2011 in Hollywood, CA. <B>Lauren Conrad</b> was caught by the paparazzi leaving Hollywood nightclub Tru on October 17, after a night of partying with (and dining with at Beso earlier that evening) rumored beau Derek Hough. For Lauren's date night ensemble, she chose a pair of shorts and a top from her clothing line Paper Crown, teamed with her favorite Miu Miu sandals and a Chanel tote. On a beauty note, Lauren's recently dyed peach tips were visible in her top bun hairstyle. To steal Lauren's look, try either Minnie Rose's Spacedye Long Sleeve Crew in <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/minnie-rose/spacedye-long-sleeve-crew-in-orange-sunrise/product.html">Orange Sunrise</a> or <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/minnie-rose/spacedye-long-sleeve-crew-in-yellow-sunrise/product.html">Yellow Sunrise</a>, paired with Free People's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/free-people/vegan-leather-short-pants-/product.html">Vegan Leather Shorts in Black</a> and Danielle Stevens Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/danielle-stevens-jewelry/gold-mesh-necklace/product.html">Gold Mesh Necklace</a>. A very cute look for Lauren, I think! Do you agree, readers? While all signs point to Lauren and Derek's dating status as heating up, I've heard some contrasting reports that Lauren's not as smitten as Derek is. However, a source inside a club during one of their recent dates claims: "<I>It was obvious there was a lot of chemistry between the two. She was very smitten. Neither seemed embarrassed about kissing in public.</i>" Are LC and DH in it for the long haul? Only time will tell!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 28 2011 in Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed making a variety of facial expressions after a night out at popular Hollywood destination Beacher's Madhouse on September 28, opting for a classic LC ensemble for her night out.

Ever since splitting with ex Kyle Howard a few months ago, Lauren has been single and seemingly ready to mingle. The latest reports claim that Lauren has allegedly been mingling with "Dancing with the Stars" star Derek Hough. According to <i>The Hollywood Gossip</I>, "<I>They've been on a few dates together.</i>" The duo was most recently seen at Sayers Club in Hollywood, where another insider reports: "<I>They were pretty cozy. Definitely playful and flirty. They were close to each other. He had his arm around her waist. They were dancing and also holding hands. When they left, paparazzi snapped away, but the two didn't stand too close together. A security guy also tried to block the shots.</i>" What do you think of this potential reality star coupling - do you see it working out?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 08 2011 in Los Angeles, CA. Making a promotional appearance at Nordstrom at the Grove in LA for Fashion's Night out on September 8, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> posed and smiled for cameras before a meet and greet with fans to promote her new line Paper Crown. Wearing a body con Paper Crown (of course) dress, Lauren kept the rest of her accessories minimal, opting only for <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/celebs/laurens-leggy-night-out-sighting.html">her favorite pair</a> of black ankle strap pumps. For two dresses here on CoutureCandy that are similar to Lauren's, check out Lotta Stensson's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/lotta/shirred-v-neck-dress-in-cobalt-/product.html">Shirred V Neck Dress in Cobalt</a> or Alexia Admor's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/alexia-admor/scoopneck-ring-back-in-black-/product.html">Scoopneck Ring Back Dress in Black</a>; Sena's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/sena/vandal-dress-in-royal-blue/product.html">Vandal Dress in Royal Blue</a> is slightly sexier and comes in a gorgeous color.

Thoughts on this look, everyone? While it's unsurprisingly simple, a classic, chic look is definitely what Lauren does best. The former reality star recently spoke to <i>Elle</i> about the new line, saying: "<i>The story of Paper Crown came from when I used to visit my grandmother. We would always want to play dress up, but she didnt have my dress up trunk there. So, we would cut things out of paper and make crowns and that was our own way of dressing up. With Paper Crown, our palette is always going to be much softer and more romantic then most of the other colors out there. You want to incorporate new trends, but still stay true to the brand youve created.</i>" Let's hope she steps out of the box just a <i>tad</i> more than she has on her other collections, though!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 02 2011 in West Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was caught leaving West Hollywood hotspot Trousdale arm-in-arm with a girlfriend on September 2, flaunting her legs in a barely-there 'fit. They key to showing off one body part in a major way (i.e. legs) is to keep the rest of your body covered, which Lauren does here. Fashionistas, take note! When getting ready for her night out, Lauren must have kept the old adage "if you've got it, flaunt it!" in mind. She paired a sheer striped blouse (for something similar, try either Central Park West's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/central-park-west/central-park-west-metro-stripe-top/product.html">Metro Striped Top in Black/Cream</a> or Splendid's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/splendid/sheer-stripe-tee-in-white/product.html">Sheer Stripe Tee in White</a>) with a pair of micro shorts (like Bleulab's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/bleulab/shortcut-cutoff-shorts-in-hydron-black-/product.html">Shortcut Cutoff Shorts in Hydron Black</a>) and black ankle strap pumps (very similar to L.A.M.B.'s <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/lamb/lamb-pounce-pony-hair-ankle-strap-pump/product.html">Pounce Pony Hair Ankle Strap Pump in Black</a>). On a beauty note, Lauren opted for ruby red lips and her trademark California girl waves. What are your thoughts on this outfit, everyone? After recently launching her newest fashion line Paper Crown, Lauren seems to be as busy as ever. She recently dished about her latest projects, and said: "<I>Im still writing, and designing. Honestly Im pretty content right now. I have a series that I have to write, hopefully each fashion line will progress and grow, so I have more to come. At this moment Im really happy with everything thats on my plate. Im able to have a personal life and work and balance it all.</i>" Sounds like she's in a really good place!</p>

She says: "<I>In the past five years I have developed my own personal style. Dressing myself has become less of a chore and more of something I can enjoy. Through trial and error, I learned what worked for me and what didn't. Now I tend to gravitate towards the more classic, feminine looks. I enjoy slipping into a platform to run errands, or throwing my hair into a polished up-do to head to my office. I have fun with it.</i>" She also added: "<I>During my time at Teen Vogue, I learned about trend forecasting. We would shoot editorials three months before they would appear in the magazine. We would have swimwear in the closet in the winter. It always felt so odd, but it taught me to try and stay ahead of trends. This is important when you are designing pieces that won't hit stores for another six months.</i>" Very true!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 25 2010 in Malibu, CA. Stepping out in Malibu on October 25 with her beau Kyle Howard, reality princess <b>Lauren Conrad</b> kept her look cozy and casual while she sipped on a hot beverage from Starbucks. Lauren started with an oversized long sleeve tee (the silhouette of Carter's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/carter/oversized-bamboo-blouse-/product.html">Oversized Bamboo Blouse in Burnt Peach</a> is similar) that she paired with dark distressed skinny jeans (try Tag Jeans' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tag-clothing/chelsea-2-skinny/product.html">Chelsea 2 Skinny in Super Destroyed Dark</a>) and her favorite pair of Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses, and then kept warm with a scarf (check out Aude's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/aude/light-grey-striped-scarf/product.html">Light Grey Striped Scarf</a>). For the finishing touches to her look, Lauren toted one of her many Chanel bags (while there is no substitute for Chanel, take a peek at Julie K Handbags' tres chic <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/julie-k-handbags/renee-flap-shoulder-bag/product.html">Renee Flap Shoulder Bag in Black</a>). Since we've seen so much of Lauren in "dressed up book tour" mode lately, what are your thoughts about her laid back style here, readers? In a recent interview about her style, Lauren dished about what her favorite first date outfit is. She said, "<I>I think it depends on where you're going. My dates are more casual now that my boyfriend's done wooing me. So, I'm more of a jeans and sweater girl now. For first dates I think that you want to put in the effort but you don't want to look like you're trying too hard. So. I think it's nice to mix high and low. So if you're wearing a nice bottom, wear a casual top or vice versa. If you're wearing a nicer dress, maybe throw an oversize blazer or a cardigan over it. So you still look relaxed, but nice.</i>" Do you agree with her thoughts?

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 19 2010 in Bloomington, MN. Stopping off at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota on October 19, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed at yet another promotional appearance on her book tour (which seems to be lasting forever!). Lauren happily smiled for fans and signed copies of her new books, sticking with her basic and sophisticated style for her store appearance. For her outfit, Lauren picked an embellished navy mini dress (for a similar option, check out Walter's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/walter/cotton-ottoman-dress-/product.html">Cotton Ottoman Dress in Navy/Black</a>, or opt for something a bit edgier like Kill City's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/kill-city/holy-roller-dress/product.html">Holy Roller Dress in Heather</a>) that she paired with black platforms (for a classic black pump without the platform, go with Coye Nokes' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/coye-nokes/jacqueline-pump/product.html">Jacqueline Pump in Black Crocco</a>), a Chanel bag and a delicate bracelet (I love Ettika's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/ettika/gold-and-turquoise-wrap-bracelet-/product.html">Gold and Turquoise Wrap Bracelet</a>). Are you a fan of Lauren's look here, readers? In a recent interview, Lauren spoke out about whether or not she has any guilty fashion pleasures, and said: "<I>I do love my shoes and bags, but I do tend to sway towards more classic investment pieces, so its not like I buy them every day. I'd probably say Urban Outfitters tees, because I'm buying them every week. They're always a little cooler there. I'm trying to update my gym wardrobe. Most of my off days I'm in gym clothes.</i>" When asked about what the most expensive piece of clothing she's ever purchased, Lauren said: "<I>I bought a Cavalli gown. That was very expensive. It was funny because I bought it in Vegas. I was so excited I refused to pack it in my checked luggage. So I carried it on the plane. I got to LAX and I looked down and realized I had left it in the restaurant. And I was like, you gotta be kidding me. I freaked out, and we were calling the security of the airport for two days. And they ended up finding it. Someone's got very good karma for turning it in. I wore it to either a premiere or finale of The Hills that we did on the beach. It was cream and had a large orange-colored flower on the side. Floor length. It was simple, but I liked it.</i>" Do any of you remember this dress? Here's a <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_GgQtqLiRv-8/TK6yuTuWpoI/AAAAAAAAyVc/lDJsyhehb48/s1600/LC_cavalli.jpg">picture</a> of it to refresh your memory!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 08 2010 in Los Angeles, CA. Keeping up with her rigorous promotional schedule, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> made a stop at LA's The Grove for a book signing on October 8. For her promotional appearance, Lauren chose a vibrant blue BCBG Max Azria dress that she paired with a skinny patent waist belt, a few rings and a pair of black patent pumps. To get a look similar to Lauren's, take a look at a few of the similar dresses on CoutureCandy, such as Single Dress' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/single-dress/rocker-dress-with-belt-/product.html">Rocker Dress with Belt in Royal</a>, Soul Revival's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/soul-revival/vince-starlight-dress-/product.html">Vince Starlight Dress in Twilight</a>, or Karen Zambos' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/karen-zambos/gaga-dress/product.html">Gaga Dress in Cobalt</a>. From there, add a little edge with your accessories with Linea Pelle Collection's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/linea-pelle/pyramid-studded-hip-belt/product.html">Pyramid Studded Hip Belt in Black</a> and you'll be set. Lauren has been quite the busy girl lately, most specifically because she's gearing up to start filming her new reality show for MTV! Lauren spoke to <i>Us Weekly</i> about everything, and said: "<I>Right now it's like music samples and picking lights. We start in about a week. I'm excited. It's smaller this time, which is really great and most of the people I'm working with are most of my favorite people.</i>" Divulging just a little bit more info, she continued: "<I>It's going to focus on a clothing line I'm doing with two of my best friends, but it's also going to show all the other things that I do as well as the lifestyle. This [show] is the other side. While we were filming, there was so much of our lives that we weren't allowed to show, and this is basically the rest.</i>" Very interesting! Are you curious to see the format of the new show?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 05 2010 in New York, NY. Making a stop on her promotional book tour, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> appeared at the Barnes & Noble on 86th and Lexington in NYC on October 5, looking pretty and polished in a delicate white lace Marchesa dress. Lauren was there to meet fans and sign copies of her two new books, "Lauren Conrad Style" and "Sugar and Spice." If you are keen on the lace trend, take a look at either Sue Wong's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/sue-wong/all-over-soutache-lace-dress-in-beige-/product.html">All Over Soutache Lace Dress in Champagne</a> or Isabel Lu's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/isabel-lu/lacy-inlay-spaghetti-dress/product.html">Lacy Inlay Spaghetti Dress in White</a>, and then pair with a sparkling headband and neutral pumps, like Coye Nokes' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/coye-nokes/jacqueline-pump/product.html">Jacqueline Pump in Taupe Patent</a>, as Lauren did. For your ensemble's finishing touch, keep the jewelry to a minimum with Jacquie Aiche's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/jacquie-aiche/14k-gold-twisted-waif-set/product.html">14k Gold Twisted Waif Set</a>, which can be stacked or worn alone. What are your thoughts on Lauren's look for her book signing, readers... is this a little too bridal for you or are you loving it? If you're a fan of Conrad's, I'm sure you know that she has confirmed her new reality show on MTV. According to MTV.com, "<I>Among the 24-year-old fashion maven's friends featured in the new program are Maura, her roommate, and Gary, who fans might remember from his time on MTV's short-lived reality series "Styl'D." Expect Gary and Maura to play integral roles on the new show, which is still in its early stages.</i>" Will any of her former "Hills" cast mates join her on the show? Lauren says, "<I>I don't know [what will happen], 'cause we haven't started filming yet. So stay tuned! But my roommate and one of my best friends is running the company, the business end, and another one of my good friends, Gary, is doing kind of the creative direction.</i>" Lauren continues: "<I>I'm excited, because I get to work with some of my old crew, which is really cool. I haven't gotten to see them in a while because they're all very busy people, but hopefully I'm going to get some familiar faces.</i>" Who's going to be tuning in?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 31 2010 in Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed heading into Hollywood hotspot MyStudio on August 31, following a dinner at Loteria Grill with a few girlfriends. Lauren showed up to MyStudio to support a friend, as she tweeted earlier both about her plans and her super-tall hairdo. She tweeted: "<I>Girl's night out with @jillyHendrix at My Studio tonight!! Come early to hear her DJ!</i>" That tweet was followed by "<i>Higher the hair, closer to god... Tonight I'm feeling like saint haha.</i>" Oh, Lauren! For her clubgoing outfit, Lauren paired a simple strapless dress (like Luc by Lucy's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/luc-by-lucy/tube-top-tracey-dress-in-pale-pink/product.html">Tube Top Tracey Dress in Pale Pink</a>) under a cropped black leather motorcycle jacket (similar to BB Dakota's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/bb-dakota/washed-leather-moto-jacket/product.html">Washed Leather Moto Jacket in Black</a>), and then wore a pair of black satin peeptoe Christian Louboutin heels and a chain necklace (like Calico Juno Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/calico-juno-designs/3-circle-multi-chain-necklace/product.html">3 Circle Multi Chain Necklace in Gold</a>).

In other Lauren news, she recently spoke out to <i>Glamour</i> about her body issues, where she said: "<I>Ive never felt a push to be stick thin. I work out and eat healthy, so mostly its about being in shape and having energy. But about a year ago, I looked down and thought, I have cellulite. Where did that come from? I went through treatments; [my body] was like, its not going anywhere.</i>" Can any of you relate?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 20 2010 in Hollywood, CA. Out on the town with her boyfriend, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed leaving Colony in Hollywood on August 20 after celebrating her friend's birthday at the hotspot. Opting for a body-con LBD with her nude quilted Chanel bag and a pair of satin Louboutin peeptoe heels, Lauren accessorized minimally with her staple charm necklace and a silver ring (try CC Skye's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/cc-skye/pave-knuckle-ring/product.html">Pave Knuckle Ring in Silver</a>). For a few options that are similar to Lauren's dress on CoutureCandy are Fernanda Carneiro's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/fernanda-carneiro/regina-dress-in-black---/product.html">Regina Dress in Black</a>, Splendid's looser fitting <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/splendid/layered-dress/product.html">Layered Dress in Black</a> and Carter's edgier <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/carter/twist-on-the-classic-dress-/product.html">Twist on The Classic Dress in Black</a>, which utilizes the super hot mesh trend of the moment. Lauren's still sporting her tri-tone hairstyle, and given all of these elements, are you into her look? Is this something you would wear for a night on the town? Her style always proves to be quite simple, but she knows what works for her and sticks to it. Would you wish she took a <i>few</i> more fashion risks, though? If you were a fan of "The Hills," you'll remember the moment when Lauren and ex-friend Heidi Montag fought over Heidi's then boo Spencer, and Lauren infamously called Spencer "a sucky person!" It seems that now that Heidi and Spencer are allegedly on the outs, Heidi is seeing Lauren's side a little more clearly. Heidi tweeted to Lauren: "<I>@LaurenConrad you were right! Spencer is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sucky!!!</i>" Wow. Do you believe the whole Heidi/Spencer drama or do you think they're still working together for press? Lauren is so much wiser to have taken the high road!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 14 2010 in Los Angeles, CA. Always up for a good time, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was caught by the paparazzi as she left a house party in LA on August 14, a party that was also attended by Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz. When it came to Lauren's wardrobe, however, it seems as though she raided the closet of her BFF Lo Bosworth. Lo just wore the same printed romper to an event at Drai's back <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/celebs/los-style-staples-sighting.html">on August 3</a>, in case you'd forgotten. So, who do you think worked this romper better, readers? In addition to her playful romper (I love 7 for All Mankind's monochromatic <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/7-for-all-mankind/romper-by-7-/product.html">Romper by 7 in Grey</a>), Lauren nabbed one of her many lustworthy Chanel bags and slipped into a cozy black cardigan (try Bailey 44's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/bailey-44/command-and-control-cardi/product.html">Command & Control Cardi in Black</a>, or go for a sheer look with Wit.'s <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/wit/light-weight-boyfriend-cardi-in-black-/product.html">Light Weight Boyfriend Cardi in Black</a>). She finished off her look with a neutral pair of strappy flat sandals (check out Gwyneth Shoes' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/gwyneth-shoes/briee-strap-sandal-/product.html">Briee Strap Sandal in Orange</a>) and her favorite oversized Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses. I'm really interested to hear which former "Hills" gal you think rocked this look better, which proves to be versatile enough for daytime and nighttime wear. In case you were wondering, photos from Lauren's LC by Lauren Conrad for Kohls Fall 2010 collection has been released - click <a href="http://hillsfreak.blogspot.com/2010/08/lc-lauren-conrad-for-kohls-fall-2010.html">here</a> to check them out. The newest collection in her Kohl's line is described: "<I>This fall we're seeing lots of feminine touches like ruffles, floral prints, flouncy skirts, and lace, but nothing is too sweet. Rather, the girly vibe is casual yet sophisticated, and decidedly California-chic, expressed by relaxed silhouettes, sexy leggings and a subdued color palette. Prices range from $34 for a ruffle-tiered chiffon tank top; $50 for a lace-back cardigan to $70 for a motorcycle jacket.</i>" Any of you keen on picking up any of these pieces?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 06 2010 in Huntington Beach, CA. Beach babe <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted at the Hurley Walk The Walk Teen Fashion Competition that was held at the Huntington Beach Pier on August 6, where she served as a judge as a fashion competition that supports high school arts programs. In the competition, 6 high schools presented their runway versions of "Friday Night Football" meets "The Runway" in hopes of winning the $25,000 prize for their school. For her beachy ensemble, Lauren slipped into a pair of little black shorts (try Joe's Jeans' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/joes-jeans/x-lover-short-in-conner-/product.html">Ex-Lover Short in Conner</a>) and an oversized patterned tank (both Ella Moss' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/ella-moss/print-tank/product.html">Print Tank</a> and Scrapbook Originals' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/scrapbook-originals/selene-tank-/product.html">Selene Tank in Blue</a> are similar), and finished things up with a huge pair of sunnies, a single bangle on her right wrist, and her favorite Miu Miu heels (get the look with Coye Nokes' beach-worthy <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/coye-nokes/grace-wedge-sandal-/product.html">Grace Wedge Sandal in Cognac</a>). The two-tone hair color she's been sporting lately is still in full effect here, as her platinum ends offset her brunette roots. Are you a fan of this two-tone hair that so many celebs have been sporting lately? In other Lauren news, the former "Hills" star is launching another (a third!) clothing line. Lauren says: "<I>Its a contemporary womens line. Where Kohls is a lot of daywear, its a lot of basics. This will be more specialty basics, more of a boutique line. It will be at a higher price point. It will be very different. Its one thing to work with a huge retailer like Kohls and there is so much you get to do, but there is a little more of a thrill of doing it on your own. Its a lot more work, its a lot more stressful, but its something I love doing so Im really looking forward to it.</i>" I wonder what Lauren's "very different" clothing line is going to look like!</p>

After attending the series finale event for "The Hills" the prior evening, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed heading to her car after dining at Philippe Chow on Melrose in LA on July 14, keeping her look light and summery in typical Lauren fashion. For her outfit she started with a pretty floral mini dress (similar to both Luc by Lucy's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/luc-by-lucy/one-shoulder-summer-dress/product.html">One Shoulder Summer Dress in Floral Print</a> and Sue Wong's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/sue-wong/embroidered-flower-summer-dress/product.html">Embroidered Flower Summer Dress in Ivory/Purple</a>) that she paired with a pretty headband and gold chain bracelet (like Danielle Stevens Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/danielle-stevens-jewelry/green-glass-and-chain-bracelet-/product.html">Green Glass and Chain Bracelet</a>). We all know by now that Lauren loves to match her bag to her shoes or her belt (exhibits <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/celebs/la-candy-the-movie-sighting.html">A</a> and <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/celebs/laurens-two-cents-on-paris-and-dougs-split-sighting.html">B</a>), and tonight was no exception to the rule! Lauren paired a camel colored bag (check out Rough Roses' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/rough-roses/francesca-carry-all-/product.html">Francesca Carry All in Camel</a>) with a pair of strappy heels. How are you feeling about Conrad's floral look here - do you love it, or is it a bit too cutesy for your taste? While we all know that Lauren's books are wildly successful, it's being reported that for her upcoming spinoff of her "L.A. Candy" series, she is going much darker in tone. Wait, who knew Lauren had a dark side? Well apparently she does. She says, "<I>I'm going to take Madison from the book and do a darker series. I already wrote a little bit and it was really fun.</i>" Lauren just finished writing the third book of the "L.A. Candy" trilogy, and while the protagonist of the book - Jane - isn't always the biggest fan of the limelight that being famous brings, LC thinks it would be fun to explore the other side of the coin. She says, "<I>I think it would be really fun to do it the other way, with someone who loves it. Someone who loves the fame and plays that game well</i>." Hmmm... I wonder who she might be referring to?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on May 21 2010 in Beverly Hills, CA. Everyone's favorite former reality star, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted leaving a salon in Beverly Hills on May 21, going for a super casual yet still super chic look. Lauren proves that basic can still be beautiful in a flowy heather grey tank dress (just like T by Alexander Wang's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/t-by-alexander-wang/classic-tank-dress-/product.html">Classic Tank Dress in Heather Grey</a>) and a pair of Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses. For the rest of her ensemble, Lauren kept the accessories to a minimum, opting only for her signature charm necklace (try Maya Brenner Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/maya-brenner/the-charm-ing-necklace-in-gold-/product.html">The Charm-ing Necklace In Gold</a>), an ivory tote (I love Zambos & Siega's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/zambos-and-siega/mansfield-bag-/product.html">Mansfield Bag in Stone</a>), and a solitary gold bangle (check out Jules Smith's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/jules-smith/super-stud-bangle-/product.html">Super Stud Bangle in Yellow Gold</a>). A simple pair of uber-comfortable Rainbow sandals finished things off. Give us your thoughts, readers... are you loving Lauren's look here? For those of you who are big Conrad fans, you'll be pleased to know that more details about her style book (and the cover!) have been released. Click <a href="http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2010/05/21/exclusive-lauren-conrad-style-cover-revealed/">here</a> to check out the cover. In the book, Lauren will obviously reveal her style secrets, but there will be much more included as well. Says Conrad: "<I>The first book tour I went on, I had the opportunity to meet thousands and thousands of fans. The majority of the questions were about fashion. It was fun to share all the things I had learned.</i>" According to <i>People Style Watch</i>, the book will offer "<I>tons of never-before-seen photos and relatable advice from Conrad herself, along with her glam squad, 'personal stories, live and learn stories,' and yes, even 'a couple of high school horror stories.'</i>" Who of you is excited to pick up a copy when this hits bookstores in October?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 19 2010 in New York, NY. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted participating in some promotional duties as she made an appearance at the Hershey Times Square Store in NYC on April 19, promoting Reese's Peanut Butter Cups by signing a petition to declare "I Love Reese's Day." Um... ok? At least Lauren looked gorgeous, as she chose a champagne colored bubble dress (for similar dress options on CoutureCandy, check out KEEMiA's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/keemia/simone-draped-overlay-dress-/product.html">Simone Draped Overlay Dress in Pearl</a>, Karen Zambos' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/karen-zambos/jessica-dress/product.html">Jessica Dress in Metallic</a> or 43.46 aggaj's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/4346-aggaj/pascale-dress/product.html">Pascale Dress in Champagne</a>) that she paired with a braided waist belt (try Linea Pelle Collection's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/linea-pelle/vintage-pieced-belt-/product.html">Vintage Pieced Belt in Vintage Cognac</a>) and matching stilettos (check out Gwyneth Shoes' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/gwyneth-shoes/omyrah/product.html">Omyrah in Gold</a>). Lauren finished off her look with glistening blonde tresses and a single gold bangle on her left forearm (try CC Skye's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/cc-skye/mini-spike-bracelet/product.html">Mini Spike Bracelet in Gold</a>). I think Lauren looks really pretty here, do you agree readers? So what's behind Lauren's appearance at the Hershey store? Lauren says, "<I>I've always loved Reese's Peanut Butter Cups - who doesn't? When I found out that my favorite treat was campaigning to declare I Love Reese's Day, I had to be among the first to sign the petition.  Join me and help declare I Love Reese's Day a holiday at   www.ILoveReesesDay.com.</i>" I bet she made a pretty penny for this deal!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 06 2010 in West Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed heading into celebrity hotspot Trousdale in West Hollywood on April 6, seeming to be in a good mood as she smiled on her way in. For her night out look, Lauren paired a black silk romper (try KEEMiA's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/keemia/francesca-silk-jumper-/product.html">Francesca Silk Jumper in Black</a> or Tt Collection's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tt-collection/stacy/product.html">Stacy in Black</a>) with an oversized blazer (check out Isabel Lu's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/isabel-lu/vest-flap-oversized-blazer/product.html">Flap Oversized Blazer in Navy Black</a>) and her trusty Chanel tote, along with a pair of patterned tights and classic Christian Louboutin pumps. For the final touches, Lauren wore the delicate charm necklace that she never takes off and a simple bracelet (similar to Ettika's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/ettika/baby-gold-dust-and-turquoise-bracelet/product.html">Baby Gold Dust and Turquoise Bracelet</a>) and wore her hair in a messy side fishtail braid. What are your thoughts on Conrad's outfit here, readers - do you think the tights work well with this look, or should she have gone bare-legged? A source inside the club spied Lauren with boyfriend Kyle Howard and told <i>People, "They made a few laps around L.A.'s Trousdale Lounge, but ultimately Lauren seemed more interested in spending the night out with Kyle than hanging out with all her friends. So, the two retreated to the corner where they held hands, kissed and cuddled  and continued to do so even when they were joined by a few pals on the couch.</i>" How cute! The source then continued, "<I>Across the club, it was business usual: Paris Hilton was dancing her heart out as the center of attention, while Ashlee Simpson-Wentz spent time with a girlfriend.</i>" Seems like quite the night to be at Trousdale!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 12 2010 in Denver, CO. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> has given us quite the slew of public appearances and outfit photographs lately, as she's been on the promotional trail for her new book "Sweet Little Lies," which is already at the top of the New York Times bestseller list. For her appearance on February 5 in Boston, Lauren donned an oversized black blazer (like Zoa's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/zoa-ltd/classic-fit-blazer/product.html">Classic Fit Blazer in Black</a>) atop a blush colored camisole (check out Rachel Pally's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/rachel-pally/zoe-v-neck-cami-top/product.html">Zoe V-Neck Cami Top in Ballet</a>) and leather leggings (for a great basic pair, try Alice + Olivia's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/alice-and-olivia/front-zip-legging-/product.html">Front Zip Legging in Black</a>). Conrad accessorized with a sparkly statement necklace (like Kuo Ting Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/kuoting/chain-necklace-with-white-and-grey-pearls/product.html">Japanese White and Gray Pearl Necklace</a>) and edgy (for her) gladiator heels. Loose waves and a red manicure completed her look. On February 12, Lauren popped up in Denver, Colorado, rocking a much more prim and proper ensemble. With a slicked-back 'do and a cherry red lip, Conrad tucked a striped tank (check out Rails' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/rails/deanna-striped-tank-/product.html">Deanna Striped Tank in Navy/White</a>) into a black pencil skirt (similar to Amberlynn's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/amberlynn/zipper-skirt-in-black-/product.html">Zipper Skirt in Black</a>), changed her polish (from red to black), and slipped into her old familiar black peeptoe Christian Louboutin pumps. Which Lauren look do you like better, everyone? I am feeling the look on the left, personally. Lauren is in the process of cementing herself as a successful brand, given that her sophomore literary effort has already become a bestseller. She said, "<I>It's so gratifying for my second book to be so successful and it was so fun to write. The characters were already developed so I really enjoyed the process so much more this time around. All the characters are like my friends now.</i>" Lauren continues, "<I>I just sat in bed writing and it was the best process. Who gets to work from home in their PJ's? I'm just so thankful to my fans. Everyone is coming out to see me in the snow. I just can't believe it.</i>" Congrats, Lauren!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 03 2010 in New York, NY. Former "Hills" babe <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted working the promotional trail for her new book "Sweet Little Lies" in New York, starting with an appearance at Barnes & Noble bookstore in Tribeca on February 3. For her in-store appearance, Lauren wore a vibrant patterned mini dress (for two similar options, try either Woo's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/staci-woo/sol-printed-dress/product.html">Sol Printed Dress in Mountain Sunset</a> or Meghan Fabulous' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/meghan-fabulous/chesney-mini-dress/product.html">Chesney Mini Dress in Teal</a>) with opaque black tights and suede Christian Louboutin pumps. She kept her accessories minimal, opting only for a few silver rings, a cherry red manicure, and a low ponytail. The following day, February 4, Conrad stepped out to film a guest spot on "The Wendy Williams Show" dressed a bit more casually. She picked a short black coat (for a navy version with a similar silhouette, try Woo's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/staci-woo/martin-coat-/product.html">Martin Coat in Navy</a>) with a grey scarf (like Raw 7's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/raw-7/shredded-tube-scarf/product.html">Shredded Tube Scarf in Grey</a>), Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses, a gorgeous Chanel bag, and a pair of black peeptoes. Which outfit do you prefer Lauren in, casual and chic on the left, or pretty and polished on the right? Lauren recently spoke to <i>Seventeen Magazine</i> about how her career was boosted by appearing on "The Hills" (duh), saying, "<I>When the show started to be successful, I realized it could be a platform for getting into fashion. But in the beginning, I was 17 and I just wanted to be on TV. I wish I could give myself more credit and say I had a whole business plan, but really I just thought MTV was cool and that it would be fun.</i>" Have any of you bought her new book yet?</p>

What are your thoughts on Lauren's look here, readers - hot or not? While Lauren has repeatedly said in the past that plastic surgery is not her thing, it seems that frenemy Heidi Montag is beyond obsessed.

Quite the difference! In the past, Lauren was quoted as saying: "<I>Its hard because do try to be beautiful on your own and be happy with the way you look, or do you listen to the criticism? They put [young stars] on this platform, and they tear them apart and then they criticize them even more for changing themselves. Its hard to say. I think you just try and be confident with the way you are.</i>" What do you think of Heidi's transformation?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 31 2009 in Hollywood, CA. Always up for an evening of fun, <b>Stephanie Pratt</b>, <b>Lauren Conrad</b>, and <b>Lo Bosworth</b> were spotted posing for photographers as they rang in the New Year at Beso in Hollywood on December 31. It seems like even though Lauren said sayonara to "The Hills," she still loves to party with her former castmates - remember when they all posed together at the <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/celebs/pretty-maxim-partygoers-sighting.html">Maxim Magazine Event at Voyeur Nightclub on November 11</a>? For their NYE ensembles, let's break it down one by one, starting with Stephanie. She paired an uber-sexy shiny gold top with a black mini skirt, black heels, an oversized cocktail ring and a bubblegum pink lip. Get her look by starting with LaROK's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/larok/rayna-top-in-tan-/product.html">Rayna Top in Tan</a>, which offers a bit more coverage, and pairing with Tt Collection's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tt-collection/carrie-skirt/product.html">Carrie Skirt in Black</a> and Megan Greene's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/megan-greene/ninotchka-in-midnight-/product.html">Ninotchka Ring in Midnight</a>. Stephanie's look is a bit brazen, but I guess if not on New Year's Eve, then when? Next up is Lauren, who played it a little bit safer in a classic LBD (try either Sue Wong's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/sue-wong/poly-krinkle-slip-dress-/product.html">Poly Krinkle Slip Dress in Black</a>, Tricia Fix's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tricia-fix/ladytron-mini-/product.html">Ladytron Mini in Snake</a>, or Isabel Lu's great <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/isabel-lu/little-black-dress/product.html">Little Black Dress</a>) with a silver chain necklace and black peeptoe Louboutin heels. She seemed to be in a more festive mood than her two galpals, donning a gaudy, cheapo NYE hat and silver horn in her right hand. Rounding out the three amigos, we have Lo who, like Steph, went with something sparkly, donning an embellished black and gold mini dress (check out either LaROK's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/larok/sweetie-sequin-dress-in-wood-/product.html">Sweetie Sequin Dress in Wood</a> or Susana Monaco's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/susana-monaco/string-dress-in-mod-dot-/product.html">String Dress in Mod Dot</a> for two more casual options) with drop earrings and a black suede pump. Now for the moment of truth: which gal do you think looks the best at Beso? I think it's the combination of her pretty hairstyle, dress and minimal makeup and accessories that makes Lo win this one for me. Do you agree?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Dec 11 2009 in West Hollywood, CA. Is it just me, or have we been seeing less and less of <b>Lauren Conrad</b> ever since she left "The Hills"? She either goes out (shopping, lunching, partying) a lot less, or she's just not photographed as much if she is going out. Either way, it's nice to see her out in the holiday spirit on December 11 as she hit up Crown Bar in West Hollywood with beau Kyle Howard, fully decked out in her festive best. Lauren started with a wine colored bow-like skirt (get a similar effect with Walter's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/walter/satin-crepe-pleat-skirt/product.html">Satin Crepe Pleat Skirt in Chocolate</a>) and then paired a ruffled camisole (I love the rich purple shade of Twelfth Street by Cynthia Vincent's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/12th-street-by-cynthia-vincent/ruffled-front-cami/product.html">Ruffled Front Cami in Purple</a>) with a black boyfriend blazer (the red and green plaid detailing on the inner sleeve of The Battalion's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/the-battalion/boyfriend-blazer---/product.html">Boyfriend Blazer in Black</a> is so fun for this time of year) and one of her classic Chanel bags. She completed her look with a pair of satin Christian Louboutin peeptoe heels with bow detailing, and her trademark dainty charm necklace (like Maya Brenner Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/maya-brenner/the-charm-ing-necklace-in-gold-/product.html">The Charm-ing Necklace in Gold</a>). The final touch? An updo with a black bow strategically placed on it, that looks like it just came off of a present. So cute! What do you think, readers - did Lauren go overboard on the whole bow motif, from the skirt to the hair to the shoes? For those of you who are interested in what Lauren's been up to ever since leaving her hit MTV show (which just got picked up for ANOTHER season, fyi) - Conrad is working on her first style guide, which is rumored to debut in fall 2010. She says, "<I>I think fashion should be fun and reflective of who you are. When you wear clothes you feel good in, it shows in everything you do. I know this guide will offer simple, practical tips to help anyone look fabulous.</i>" Are any of you out there interested in style tips from Ms. Conrad?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 11 2009 in West Hollywood, CA. The girls of "The Hills" (well, two of them at least) were spotted out on the red carpet of the launch party for the Assassin's Creed II video game hosted by Maxim Magazine at Voyeur Nightclub in West Hollywood last night, November 11, as <b>Lo Bosworth</b>, <b>Stephanie Pratt</b>, and <b>Lauren Conrad</b> struck a unified pose in front of the photogs. It's nice to see that Lauren joins her former co-stars from time to time for these glitzy shindigs, and as bad as it is to say this, she's probably loving the fact that the ratings on "The Hills" have dropped so drastically since she left MTV's popular reality show. For their party-rific outfits, let's start with Lo. She paired a demure French Connection black mini (for similar options, check out Karen Zambos' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/karen-zambos/sydney-dress/product.html">Sydney Dress in Black</a> or Tt Collection's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tt-collection/audry-dress-/product.html">Audry Dress in Black</a>) with Prada booties and a sophisticated updo. Stephanie, on the other hand, chose a glittery sequined frock (like Karen Zambos' long sleeved <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/karen-zambos/twiggy-dress-/product.html">Twiggy Dress in Metallic</a> or LaROK's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/larok/sequined-rolly-dress-in-black/product.html">Sequined Rolly Dress in Black</a>) that turned out to be more sheer and revealing than she initially thought - her hot pink panties are on full display! She finished off her look with a classic black clutch and YSL Divine heels. Lauren picked a pale pink mini dress (take a look at Gold Hawk's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/gold-hawk/tribal-queen-shift-dress/product.html">Tribal Queen Shift Dress in Soft Praline</a>) that she topped with Ashish's sparkling boyfriend blazer (similar to 7 for All Mankind's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/7-for-all-mankind/sequin-blazer/product.html">>Sequin Blazer in Ash</a>) and paired with her trademark gold charm necklace with a coral accent. What are your thoughts, readers - who knocked their look out of the park for the Maxim event, and if you had to choose, which look do you like the best? I have to give it to Lauren on this one!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 11 2009 in Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted posing on the red carpet of Hollywood Life's 6th Annual 2009 Hollywood Style Awards, held at the Armand Hammer Museum on October 6, there to support friend Brody Jenner who won the Young Men's Hollywood Style Icon Award (no comment). For Lauren's stylish ensemble, she paired Mara Hoffman's Spring 2010 floral frock (for similar, fun options, try Nu by Marc Anthony's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nu-by-marc-anthony/printed-dress/product.html">Printed Dress in Print D</a>, Single Dress' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/single-dress/beaded-floral-print-dress/product.html">Beaded Floral Print Dress in Rose</a>, or Pink Polka Dot's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/pink-polka-dot/pink-black-abstract-dress/product.html">Pink/Black Abstract Dress</a>) with a studded waist belt (I'm into CC Skye's Hermes-esque <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/cc-skye/ashley-belt/product.html">Ashley Belt in Black</a>) and her favorite charm necklace and double finger ring (similar to Erica Anenberg's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/erica-anenberg/pewter-double-finger-ring-silver/product.html">Pewter Double Finger Ring in Silver</a>). She finished her look with a simple pair of classic black pumps. What are your thoughts on Lauren's look here, readers - personally, I think Lauren looks great when she wears a young and vibrant dress like this. In other LC news, do you remember when Lauren said that she wanted her BFF Lo to <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/celebs/starring-in-la-candy-sighting.html">star in "LA Candy" the movie</a>? Turns out that was more of a joke than anything! Lo tells <i>E! News</i>: "<I>I would love to make a cameo, but I don't think I could handle a big role because I'm not an actress. A cameo would be really fun.</i>" And for those of you who have commented about the, ahem, not so subtle changes in <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/celebs/adios-hills-for-steph-sighting.html">Stephanie Pratt's face</a> a few entries down, Lauren is speaking out about her opinion of her former castmates going under the knife. Conrad says, "<I>Its hard because youre in that position where youre being criticized for everything. Its hard because do you ignore it, and try to be beautiful on your own and be happy with the way you look, or do you listen to the criticism. They put them on this platform, and they tear them apart and then they criticize them even more for changing themselves. Its hard to say. I think you just try and be confident with the way you are.</i>" Do you agree with Lauren's stance, readers?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 18 2009 in Los Angeles, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed at the Kate Somerville Emmy Gifting Suite Event in Los Angeles yesterday, September 18, mingling with skin expert Somerville while scooping up her luxe products. Lauren, looking polished as always, started with a loose golden tunic (for two similar frocks, try Juicy Couture's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/juicy-couture/jackie-ruffle-dress-in-beausoleil-/product.html">Jackie Ruffle Dress in Beausoleil</a> or Ingwa Melero's intricate <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/ingwa-melero/charmeause-lotus-mini-dress-in-chartreuse/product.html">Charmeause Lotus Mini Dress in Chartreuse</a> - or for similar silhouettes in different shades, check out Velvet's comfortable <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/velvet/charonna-in-brown/product.html">Charonna Dress in Brown</a> or 12th Street by Cynthia Vincent's absolutely beautiful <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/12th-street-by-cynthia-vincent/beaded-neck-dress-in-grey-/product.html">Beaded Neck Dress in Grey</a>) that she belted (similar to Julie K Handbags' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/julie-k-handbags/tess-belt-/product.html">Tess Belt in Golden</a>) and paired with delicate heels, a gold bangle (take a look at Rachel Leigh Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/rachel-leigh-jewelry/sweet-tooth-bangle-in-gold-/product.html">Sweet Tooth Bangle in Gold</a>) and her signature single hair braid. What are your thoughts on Lauren's look here - basic, yes... but pretty, no? Lauren was spotted earlier today in Santa Monica participating in a Kohl's Department Store-sponsored beach clean up, and I can only assume she was there for one of two reasons. The first, that she actually cares about keeping our beaches clean (she did grow up on the beach in Laguna, after all) - and the second, that she was contractually obliged to be there, due to the fact that she just released her new clothing line at Kohl's. Lauren tells <i>Us Weekly</I> that her new line is "<I>a little more casual... trying to take that California style and make it accessible everywhere.</i>" A rep from the department store added in "<I>We are confident the LC Lauren Conrad collection brings customers both the contemporary style and the world-class brand.</i>" While the collection contains mostly skinny jeans, flowy tops, and pretty dresses, do you have any interest in checking it out?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 06 2009 in Los Angeles, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted at the Warren Tricomi Salon on Melrose Ave. on August 7 for a quick trim and blow out, looking pretty peeved to spot the photographers waiting for her outside the salon. To start her look, Lauren picked her absolute fave heels, her tan Miu Miu Double Cross Platform Sandals, and paired them with skintight skinny blue denim (like Proportion of Blu's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/the-proportion-of-blu/skinny-jean-in-slate-blu/product.html">Skinny Jean in Slate Blu</a>), and an oversized striped tee (for similar striped options, try Rails' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/rails/deanna-striped-tank-/product.html">Deanna Striped Tank in Navy/White</a> or James Perse's dress version, the <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/james-perse/stripe-drop-dress-in-charcoal-/product.html">Stripe Drop Dress in Charcoal</a>).

What is your opinion on Conrad's casual salon 'fit? For those of you who thought that the Lauren Conrad sex tape drama had finally subsided, think again! In the new issue of <i>Playboy</i>, Lauren's frenemy Heidi Pratt mentions moments of "The Hills" that she's not proud of, and of course the sex tape came up. She said, "<I>Like when you apologized to Lauren Conrad for the sex-tape rumors so she would come to the wedding, when we know for a fact that she did have a sex tape. Its not just about Lauren, because shes not even on the show this season. Which is fine with me.</i>" Evil schemer Spencer continued, "<I>I was lying about being apologetic. And I hate lying. Yes, I facilitated that rumor, but it was true. Lauren was acting like she was little miss perfect goody two-shoes while [ex] Jason Wahler was trying to shop the tape. That tape exists!</i>" Give a rest already you two! Stop trying to use Lauren to further your "careers"!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 28 2009 in Beverly Hills, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> and <b>Lo Bosworth</b> were spotted doing some damage at Barney's New York in Beverly Hills on July 28, both toting some supersized Barney's bags as they left their shopping excursion. For their retail jaunt, Lauren started with a summery floral mini dress (check out options from Prairie New York, like the <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/prairie-new-york/barnes-dress-/product.html">Barnes Dress in Azalea</a>, or Gold Hawk, and the <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/gold-hawk/morph-print-short-dress-in-peach/product.html">Morph Print Short Dress in Peach</a>) under a lightweight grey cardigan (try Signorelli's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/signorelli/love-tree-button-cashmere-cardigan-/product.html">Love Tree Button Cashmere Cardigan in Ash</a>), oversized round sunnies, a tan leather tote (like Antoinette Lee Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/antoinette-lee-designs/stella-bag-/product.html">Stella Bag in Tan</a>) with matching leather and cork wedge heels. Lo, on the other hand, chose an oversized white button-up (patterned with bunnies!) that she rolled up the sleeves of (check out 3J Workshop's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/3j-workshop/ring-of-roses-blouse-/product.html">Ring of Roses Blouse in Rose</a> or James Perse's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/james-perse/luxury-contrast-panel-in-tearose-/product.html">Luxury Contrast Panel Shirt in Tearose</a>) and tucked it into a pair of high-waisted grey skinny jeans (try Diesel's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/diesel/cuddy-8tn-jeans-/product.html">Cuddy 8tn Jean in Grey</a>), finishing off her look with a pair of black peeptoe stilettos. What are your thoughts, readers - who is rockin' their look better, here? Fashion faceoff! For those of you Conrad fans out there, I'm sure you've scooped up a copy of her book, "LA Candy." Now, it seems that there are loud whisperings that Lauren's book may take the leap to the big screen. <i>Daily News</i> is reporting that Lauren is definitely interested, quoting her a saying "<I>We're hoping for a movie deal. I'm working on [adapting the book for the big screen] right now, but I don't want to commit to anything until I see all my options. We have had a lot of exciting news in that respect, though.</i>" A source continues, "<I>Lauren's goal is to get into producing  it always was. It was always to make 'L.A. Candy' into a film or TV show. She's been in talks about it. No deal [is] in place just yet, but the film is her ultimate goal. She would never star in it because she doesn't want to be an actress. She spent so long on TV, [she] would love to produce.</i>" Wow, that's a lot to take in! What do you think, if her book was turned into a movie, would you check it out? Either way, big congrats to L!</p>

Lauren and Lo kept their looks breezy and cool, as Lo chose a lightwash denim shirt dress (for a similar silhouette, check out Splendid's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/splendid/check-shirt-dress-/product.html">Check Shirt Dress in Navy/White</a>) with an oversized pair of brown sunnies and a few gold bangles on her right wrist, while Lauren picked a blue bikini (I love the unusual shade of FrenchFifty Swimwear's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/french-fifty/alba-bikini-in-grey-/product.html">Alba Bikini in Steel Blue</a>) under a sheer white cover up (take your pick between V i X Swimwear's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/vix-swimwear/ruffle-white-tunic-with-gold-thread-/product.html">Ruffle White Tunic with Gold Thread</a> and Da-Nang's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/da-nang/gauze-tunic-in-white-/product.html">Gauze Tunic in White</a>) with black Wayfarers and a midnight blue mani. Proving she's still a beach girl at heart, Lauren finished off her outfit with a pair of sand-colored Rainbow sandals. No Loubs at the pool for this girl! Lauren's first novel, "LA Candy," is doing very well, as the semi-biographical story has come in at #1 on the <i>New York Times</i> Best-Seller List two weeks in a row! Wow, for a girl with really no professional writing experience, that is quite a coup! Lo, on the other hand, has found a new boyfriend, and showed him the Verizon Wireless Matt Leinart Foundation Event at Lucky Strikes Lanes & Lounge in LA this past Monday. <i>People.com</i> reports that his name is Scott Hochstadt, and that he is a professional lacrosse player. A source close to Lo says, "<I>Its new but they are both really happy</i>." Lauren and Lo are always up to something!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 02 2009 in Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted with her BFF, Lo Bosworth, letting loose and having a good time at Bar Delux in Hollywood back on July 2, and showed her patriotic spirit with her red and blue mismatched manicure. Do you like this multicolored nail look - or is it only appropriate for holidays? For her nighttime, party-mode look, Lauren started with a sparkly maroon mini skirt (try Tracy Reese's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tracy-reese/pegged-skirt-in-vanialla-and-camel-/product.html">Pegged Skirt in Vanilla and Camel</a> for a more conservative fit) to which she tucked a black tank (similar to Ella Moss' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/ella-moss/parisienne-tank/product.html">Parisienne Tank in Black</a>) into, and then donned a grey blazer (go a tad bit more casual - and comfortable! - with Smitten's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/smitten/one-button-belted-sweatshirt-jacket-/product.html">One-Button Belted Sweatshirt Jacket in Heather Grey</a>) to ward off those night breezes. Lauren then kept her accessories to a minimum, toting along a black handbag with gold chain detail (similar to CC Skye's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/cc-skye/lulu-day-bag/product.html">LuLu Day Bag in Black</a>), and adding a silver bangle and a pair of black suede Christian Louboutin pumps. What are your overall thoughts on Conrad's look here - are you diggin' it? While it seems for a brief, glimmering moment, Lauren and arch-frenemy, Heidi Montag, were friends again - however, now it seems that the two are right back to doing what comes natural: hating each other. In the new issue of <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, Lauren has some not-so-nice things to say about Speidi. Regarding Heidi's spread in <i>Playboy</i>, Lauren quipped, "<I>They're not going to pay for themselves</i>," obviously referring to Heidi's, ahem, assets. When the mag asked if she'd ever pose for <i>Playboy</i>, she responded, "<I>Everyone makes those choices and wants to do different things. I just don't have any interest in showing my body in something like that. That's a little personal.</i>" She also wouldn't don medical masks while at a Mexican airport, a la Speidi during the height of Swine Flu. "<I>The face mask on vacation: I don't know if it was so funny because people really were being affected by that disease. But otherwise [Heidi and Spencer] are very entertaining. You have to laugh.</i>" So, once and for all, which team are you on... team Lauren or team Speidi?</p>

Keep an eye out for Lauren, as she'll be popping up at bookstores all over the country for her book tour. Last night, Lauren picked a kimono-sleeve blouse with an almost paint splattered or tie dye pattern (check out Cake Couture's cool selection of tie dyed sweaters, like the <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/cake-couture/honeycomb-tunic-sweater/product.html">Honeycomb Tunic Sweater in Black</a> or the <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/cake-couture/organic-tie-dye-sweater-/product.html">Organic Tie Dye Sweater in Jade</a>, or, for a dress in a similar style vein as Lauren's blouse, try Tricia Fix's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tricia-fix/kimono-dress-in-blue-print-/product.html">Kimono Dress in Blue Print</a>) tucked into a high waisted black mini skirt (take a look at Amberlynn's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/amberlynn/zipper-skirt-in-black-/product.html">Zipper Skirt in Black</a>) and accessorized with a few rings and a pair of black Christian Louboutin pumps. The look is typical Lauren - what are your thoughts, readers? Does the patterned top add a little extra spice to Conrad's otherwise bland outfit? For those of you interested in Lauren's book, it is the story of a young woman, Jane, who moves to Los Angeles for an exciting internship and becomes a hot reality television star. I guess what they say is true - it's best to write what you know! The first of three books, Lauren says, "<I>There are things Jane says that I sometimes wish I had the nerve to say out loud. In a way, 'LA Candy' is an extension of 'The Hills.' My characters are based on so many people I've met over the years. And Jane has a bit of me, but also a bit of many girls I've met who are new to this whole 'fame' thing. Jane does things I wouldn't, and that was so much fun for me to write.</i>" Additionally, Lauren has high hopes that her novel can be adapted for the small screen. She says, "<I>It's one of my hopes. We're going to start working on that when I get back from my book tour.</i>" What do you think, readers - does this sound like a good idea? It would basically be a scripted version of "The Hills," not that that isn't scripted enough already!</p>

For her easy daytime look that was composed of casual basics, Lauren started with a basic white v-neck tee (like Splendid's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/splendid/very-long-v-neck-tee/product.html">Very Long V-Neck Tee in White</a>) messily tucked into a pair of deep indigo skinnies (try Denim of Virtue's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/denim-of-virtue/patience-5-pocket-tapered-jean-in-night-club/product.html">Patience 5 Pocket Tapered Jean in Night Club</a>) and accessorized with a chestnut belt (try Pellemelle's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/pellemelle/pilgrim-belt-in-chestnut/product.html">Pilgrim Belt in Chestnut</a>) and matching oversized tote (similar to Linea Pelle's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/linea-pelle/dylan-large-bowler-bag/product.html">Dylan Large Bowler Bag in Cognac</a>). Finishing off her look, Lauren chose a pair of oversized Wayfarers, a delicate charm necklace, and proving that she's still a beach girl at heart, a comfortable pair of Rainbow sandals. While of course it is a basic look, this is the perfect outfit for casually kicking around LA and not seeming like you're trying too hard. While I'm sure you've all heard by now that Paris Hilton and her boytoy of the month, Doug Reinhardt, have called it quits, Lauren has offered up her two cents on the topic, seeing as though she used to date Doug. Says Conrad, "<I>[We] dated my senior year of high school. He moved back and then it was like, 'Oh, we'll pick up where we left off'... for a couple of weeks.'</i>" When she heard of the breakup, she exclaimed, "<I>I didn't know that! I thought they were a good match.</i>" Of reports that Hilton and Reinhardt were on the marriage path, Lauren says, "<I>She was going to marry a lot of people. But he had fun. That's all that matters.</i>" What do you think, do you agree with Lauren?</p>

Usually playing it safe and sticking to classier looks, Lauren opted for a much edgier-than-the-norm dress for her red carpet appearance (this day was also a pretty big milestone for Conrad, as her last episode of "The Hills" aired just prior to the Movie Awards). In a black and burgundy ruffled Moschino mini dress (Shumaq makes two dresses, the flashy <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/shumaq/isabelle-dress-in-silver/product.html">Isabelle Dress in Silver</a> and the more understated <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/shumaq/marrisa-dress-/product.html">Marrisa Dress in Black</a> with slightly similar silhouettes to Lauren's) with Christian Louboutin lace-up heels, a matching maroon manicure and her trademark charm necklace (try out Maya Brenner Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/maya-brenner/the-everything-necklace-in-gold-/product.html">The Everything Necklace in Gold</a>), Lauren seemed to be rockin' some major hair extensions styled into thick, beachy waves. What do you think of Lauren's look - do you think taking a chance paid off? <I>TMZ.com</i> wasn't so kind to Lauren, saying, "<I>LC came straight from a Mexican bullfight -- TORO!</i>" Ouch! That's a wee bit harsh, don't you think? For those of you who caught Lauren's exit from "The Hills," what did you think? Overall, I'd say she made a pretty gracious exit, paving way for Kristin Cavallari's trouble making entrance. "The bitch is back" the teaser proclaimed, and from the sneak preview they showed of Kristin starting drama with Audrina, I'd say that's a pretty accurate description!</p>

For her appearance outfit, Lauren started with a tight-fitting leather mini skirt (for a longer option, check out Amberlynn's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/amberlynn/zipper-skirt-in-black-/product.html">Zipper Skirt in Black</a>) with a sheer white top (like Da-Nang's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/da-nang/gauze-tunic-in-white-/product.html">Gauze Tunic in White</a>) and voluminous white scarf, and finished things off with a pair of classic black pumps, a bright turquoise manicure, and a few eye-catching bracelets (Ettika's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/ettika/medium-peace-sign-leather-bracelet/product.html">Medium Peace Sign Leather Bracelet in Orange</a> is similar to the one on her left wrist, while Amy DiGregorio's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/amy-digregorio/bourne-bridge-bracelet-/product.html">Bourne Bridge Bracelet in Gold</a> is like the one on her right). What are your thoughts on Lauren's look - a classic outfit, or do you wish she didn't play it as safe? For those of you who caught the most recent episode of "The Hills" (and Lauren's second to last), you might have gotten a little choked up when hearing Lauren's heartfelt monologue to Heidi. Lauren said, "<I>I remember being with Jason... and I remember being in that same situation where I felt like without him I would die. And I remember thinking, 'Everything would be perfect if we could go to an island somewhere,' but life isn't an island. You have to have other people in your life. I remember when we first met, you could light up any room. And since you've been with Spencer, I see that light slowly disappearing</i>." Heidi tried fighting back tears, and them made a pretty swift exit. It's so sad when you're not friends with your friends anymore! However, Lauren is telling <i>Cosmopolitan</i> that producers kept pushing her to run in to Heidi throughout her last season. She says, "<I>What they didnt get is that I didnt want to fight with her anymore. Its hard to look at somebody who used to be your best friend and say, We cant be friends. Too much has happened. Im trying to move on, but they wont let me. And when someone keeps pushing you into the same position well... you get upset.</i>" So I ask you, readers, what are your thoughts on all of this?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 21 2009 in Los Angeles, CA. "The Hills" were alive in LA on April 21, as <b>Lauren Conrad</b>, <b>Audrina Patridge</b> and <b>Lo Bosworth</b> were spotted (along with Whitney Port, Brody Jenner, and Stephanie Pratt) posing on the red carpet of PaleyFest09 held at the ArcLight Cinemas. The cast was assembled to discuss their hit show, as well as to answer questions from fans. Now we all know that the girls of the show consider themselves to be quite the fashionistas, so I have to ask - who do you think rocked their look better: L.Con, A.Pat, or LoBo? For Lauren's look, she chose a sunny tiered frock (for other yellow numbers, check out Ingwa Melero's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/ingwa-melero/nomi-dress/product.html">Nomi Dress in Yellow</a> and Woo's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/staci-woo/sol-dress/product.html">Sol Dress in Warm Sun</a>) and belted it with a nude leather belt. Along with matching heels and a single gold bangle (check out Danielle Stevens Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/danielle-stevens-jewelry/single-engraved-bracelet-/product.html">Single Engraved Bracelet in Gold</a>), Lauren kept her tresses golden and flowing. Always one to favor more of the dark side of the color spectrum, Audrina slipped into an asymmetrical black silk dress (I love Gold Hawk's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/gold-hawk/solid-ruffle-dress/product.html">Solid Ruffle Dress in Moonless Night</a>, as well as Suzabelle's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/suzabelle/agustin-dress-in-black-/product.html">Agustin Silk Dress in Black</a>) and grabbed a patent leather clutch (for a cool patent bag with an awesome message, check out Carla Mancini's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/carla-mancini/python-bag-in-black-/product.html">Leather Tote Peace Sign Symbol Bag in Black</a>), while keeping her hair messy in a casual updo and matching her bag with a pair of pointed-toe paten heels. Last but not least, Lo went for the pool-blue color scheme, choosing a royal blue satin skirt with a turquoise top (for a longer tunic version, peep Signorelli's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/signorelli/winged-tunic-/product.html">Winged Tunic in Turquoise</a>) tucked in, as well as nude Christian Louboutin stilettos  and an electric blue satin clutch with an oversized rosette. It's a tough call, but I think I'm leaning towards liking Lauren's 'fit the most. Readers? The Q&A session of the evening was definitely an interesting one, and one of the most shocking moments came when Lauren revealed that Spencer acknowledged that he was the person who started the rumors about her having a sex tape. Lauren says, "<I>We actually have it on tape. He takes responsibility and apologizes for it.</i>" Spencer taking responsibility? Talk about a shocker! Another highlight of the evening was when one fan told the cast, "<I>I feel like I know you all so well. I keep looking at you and feeling like youre going to recognize me.</i>" I'm not sure if that's cute or creepy. What do you think, "Hills" viewers - do you feel like you know Lauren & co.?</p>

In a tie-dye maxi dress (for cool patterned maxi dresses, take a peek at Tricia Fix's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tricia-fix/julie-long-dress-in-snake/product.html">Julie Long Dress in Snake</a> or Plenty by Tracy Reese's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/plenty-by-tracy-reese/maxi-slip-dress-in-red/product.html">Maxi Slip Dress in Red</a>) and casual flip flops, LC kept her accessories to a minimum, wearing only her favorite charm necklace with an additional gold disc necklace (just like Danielle Stevens Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/danielle-stevens-jewelry/10k-gold-plated-chain-necklace-oval-monogram-/product.html">10k Gold Plated Chain Necklace Oval Monogram</a>), an orange wrap-around bracelet on her left wrist and a few simple gold bangles (try Rachel Leigh's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/rachel-leigh/sweet-tooth-bangle-in-gold-/product.html">Sweet Tooth Bangle in Gold</a>) on her right. Simple and pretty - what are your thoughts? Perfect for a pool party, I say! In related "Hills" news, it seems that although Lauren and Heidi have had a tearful reunion on the show that Lauren will not be attending Heidi and Spencer's upcoming nuptials. She was asked by reporters if she was going to be checking the "yes" box on the RSVP card (and yes, Lauren was invited!), Lauren laughed, "<I>Um, probably not.</i>" No surprise there! The gruesome twosome had a "wedding" in Mexico that they decided not to make legal back in the States, and now are doing it for real (and of course in front of MTV cameras). What do you think - are you surprised that Lauren won't be attending?</p>

"Hills" cutie <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted leaving popular sushi hotspot Katsuya in Hollywood on March 19, toting along a new tan quilted Chanel bag for her night of sake and sashimi. I definitely am liking this one a lot better than her usual black Chanel bag, don't you agree?

The finishing touch? The playful lace bra peeking out from under her blouse. Another pretty and classy look for Lauren - while she may not be paving any new ground on the fashion forefront, there is no denying that she knows how to dress fun and youthfully, and perfect for her age and body type. Weigh in readers... I know you love to! For those of you Lauren fans out there, you might be disappointed to hear that Lauren's line is going to be put on pause indefinitely. Her rep says, "<I>In light of the economic climate, Lauren has decided to completely rethink her line and design with more high-end fabrics things she couldn't do the first time around. With everything going on in the economy and in her life, she wants to rework her line and offerings. She will make announcements soon.</i>" Hmmm... so is the line kaput? No way, says Conrad's rep. She continues, "<I>She is taking a hiatus, but the line still exists and will continue. The sales of her line in the first year doubled what was projected. However, in light of the economy, it's a good time for Lauren to take a few seasons off to re-work her still budding line. She will look over the past seasons to determine what worked and what didn't work so that she may design clothing that will appeal to her fans.</i>" What do you think - is it a good idea for Lauren to reinterpret her Collection?</p>

As I'm sure you already know, the upcoming Season 5 of "The Hills" will be the shows last, and executive producer Liz Gately is speaking out about Lauren's decision to call it quits. She says, "<I>Fans first fell in love with Lauren when she was just 17 years old and a high school senior in Laguna Beach. For the five years that followed, Lauren allowed MTV to follow every aspect of her incredible journey in life. We watched her grow into an adult on The Hills, from her first real love to finding a career in fashion to difficult times when friendships unraveled. It is bittersweet, but I understand why she is saying goodbye.</i>" What do you think - will you be tuning in to this final season?</p>

In similar outfits, Lauren chose to tuck a navy cami (like Autumn Cashmere's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/autumn-cashmere/racer-back-tank---/product.html">Racer Back Tank in Peacot</a>, a navy-ish shade) into a full skirt (similar to Gold Hawk's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/gold-hawk/embroidered-skirt-in-excalibur-grey/product.html">Embroidered Skirt in Excalibur Grey</a>) and pair with black suede Loubs and a decorative gold necklace (try Calico Juno Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/calico-juno-designs/necklace-85-/product.html">Necklace 85 in Gold</a>).

Has anyone else noticed that whenever these two hit the town, they tend to wear very similar outfits? I wonder if they plan this or if it's subconscious? While the girls are currently filming Season 5, Lauren recently announced that this will be the shows last. She tells <i>Seventeen Magazine</i>,"<i>My biggest thing with the show was that I wanted to walk away from it while it's still a great thing. I always want to remember it that way. I gave MTV a deadline and said, 'This is as long as I can do it and stay sane.'</i>" Of her rumored beau Kyle Howard, Lauren says, "<I>He's a friend. I'm a fan of labels, but 'girlfriend' doesn't always look good on me. Ha!</i>" Interesting!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Jan 15 2009 in Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted filming "The Hills" at hotspot Beso in Hollywood alongside Lo Bosworth and Audrina Patridge on January 15, keeping her look simple with a classic combination of black and white.

Yet another Lauren look that doesn't take any chances, but keeping it simple and not looking like she's trying too hard is part of her charm, don't you think? In other Lauren news, it sure seems like everyone has an opinion on "The Hills," doesn't it? Teen actress Emma Roberts is speaking out about her thoughts on the show, saying, "<I>'The Hills' I dont really understand because I think everyone knows it is fake except for LC, because she is the only one crying in every episode.

What was Whit thinking with that thing? But what do you think, which girl got it right with their look (and do you like Whitney's crazy headband)? <i>Film.com</i> has named Lauren (and her outfit) as their look of the week, saying, "<I>Lauren Conrad showed up at The Hills finale after party in New York City wearing a festive frock. Her sequined Philip Lim confetti dress and pewter Christian Louboutins proved to be a perfect holiday look, and the thin gold bangle and retro curls were a fine finish.

For me personally, Ive missed her that was my best friend and its hard when thats taken out of your life. I think for both of us we kind of just want some kind of closure in one way or another.

Ignore the flowing blonde locks and almost identical denim- these two even wear their scarves tied the same way. Sheesh! For Lauren's look, start with a dark pair of super skinnies (like Desert Blue's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/desert-blue/the-phoenix-skinny-jean-in-navy/product.html">The Phoenix Skinny Jean in Navy</a>) and pair with a thin black tee (like Qi's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/qi/v-underslip/product.html">V Underslip Top in Black</a>) and a black blazer (check out Signorelli's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/signorelli/black-logo-blazer-in-black/product.html">Logo Blazer in Black</a>), and accessorize with round sunnies, a while scarf, and glittery heels. Lauren also seems to have gone back to her favorite classic red nailpolish for the holiday season. For Lo's look, start with a killer leather motorcycle jacket (check out Gold Hawk's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/gold-hawk/ribbed-motorcycle-jacket-in-black-/product.html">Ribbed Motorcycle Jacket in Black</a>), and pair with a long olive green scarf, skinny denim with a grey-ish blue wash (The ProportionofBlu's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/the-proportionofblu/uno-skinny-jean-in-indigo/product.html">Uno Skinny Jean in Indigo</a> are great) and tall camel boots with patent accents. Who do you think is rocking their (very similar) look better, though- Lauren or Lo? In other Lauren news, it seems that she still cares for Heidi Montag- or at least that's what she wants the public to believe. Heidi's sister, Holly, told <i>Us Weekly</i> that after hearing about Heidi and Spencer's surprise wedding in Mexico, "<I>Lauren called to check on everybody and make sure the family was OK.</i>" So what I really want to know is, when are Lauren and Heidi going to make their public reunion?</p>

After paying a visit to the warehouse, Lauren zoomed away in her Audi R8 to lunch at the Sunset Marquis Hotel, changing up her glasses look from the practical (wearing square prescription glasses) to trendy (wearing oversized black shades, like Nour's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nour/noushi-in-crystal-mystery/product.html">Noushi Sunglasses in Crystal Mystery</a>).

Finishing touch? Why, a pair of peeptoe Loubs of course. What do you think of this look on Lauren- hit or miss? There's no doubt that she's playing it safe, but then again, that's always been her thing! While Perez Hilton recently reported that Lauren threw a conniption fit while at JFK airport in NYC when an airport employee called her name on the loudspeaker, Lauren is taking to her Myspace blog to clear up the most recent rumors. It's always something with this girl! Conrad says, "<I>Apparently they are reporting that someone watched me throw a fit and start crying because they called my name over the speaker at JFK...Really?

To snag Lauren's look, start with a cute cropped leather jacket, like Gold Hawk's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/gold-hawk/belted-leather-jacket-/product.html">Belted Leather Jacket in Moonless Night</a>, over a ruffled white blouse (check out Gold Hawk's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/gold-hawk/sleeveless-solid-ruffle-top/product.html">Sleeveless Solid Ruffle Top in White Essence</a>) and tucked into ultra wide leg trousers (like Lotta Stensson's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/lotta/linen-palazzo-pant-in-blade-/product.html">Linen Palazzo Pant in Black</a>). Accessory wise, Lauren grabbed her trademark small Chanel bag, a gold coin necklace (similar to Maya Brenner Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/maya-brenner/santorini-coin-necklace/product.html">Santorini Coin Necklace</a>), and the studded belt that Sarah Jessica Parker made famous when she wore it playing Carrie Bradshaw in the <i>Sex and the City Movie</i> (for an equally awesome studded belt, check out Rough Roses' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/rough-roses/multi-studded-belt-in-black-/product.html">Multi Studded Belt in Black</a>). Conrad then finished her look off with those flowing, wavy locks of hers. What do you think of Lauren's look- love it or lose it? A few days later, Lauren was back in LA to hit up the Pur Jeans Halloween event held at STK and Coco Deville, rocking a flapper costume, complete with a fringe dress and feathers in her hair. She told one interviewer that she is a flapper ever year, but changes her dress and the costume a little every time. The interviewer then said that "is lame!"

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Oct 15 2008 in Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted grabbing a bite to eat at Katsuya Hollywood on October 15, in an ensemble that I'm trying to wrap my mind around. Part of me likes it, but the other part is thinking, "what's goin' on, girl??" Separately, I like the studded Louboutins and the studded bag (for a similar chain bag, check out Julie K Handbags' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/julie-k-handbags/gigi-mini-bag/product.html">Gigi Mini Bag in Azure</a>), but together, I think the studs just clash and don't work well together. Then, Lauren paired a very Blair Waldorf-esque headband with a white top (similar to 3J Workshop <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/3j-workshop/sara-top-in-white-metallic-/product.html">Sara Top in White Metallic</a>) and black leggings (like Laura Dahl's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/laura-dahl/tiny-dancers-leggings-/product.html">Tiny Dancers Leggings in Black</a>), and I think the top is just a tad bit too short with the leggings. In theory, this outfit was a good one, but I think there was just something off in the execution. Oh well, you can't win 'em all, and at least Lauren wasn't wearing another plain jersey dress from her collection! While some of you may have heard about Lauren and frenemy Heidi Montag's reunion at STK, former "Hills" castmember Brian Droulet is speaking out, and said, "<I>I know for a fact Lauren will never really become friends with Heidi again, because Lauren is a genuine, awesome person. We all went through Heidi's transformation as a group, and we know the reunion of their friendship ain't happenin'.</i>" What do you think- do you want to see Lauren and Heidi's superpowers reunite?</p>

Wrapped up in a drama tornado at the moment, due to ex-BFF Audrina Patridge's belief that she hooked up with Justin Bobby, Lauren made a statement with her tee, which read "You Can't Break My Spirit." For a similar look, nab Hank Vintage Threads' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/hank-vintage-threads/give-peace-a-chance-tank-/product.html">Give Peace A Chance Tank in Carribean</a>, and pair with super skinny jeans, like Desert Blue's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/desert-blue/the-phoenix-skinny-jean-in-soft-wash-/product.html">The Phoenix Skinny Jean in Soft Wash</a>. Lauren finished off her look with black satin ballet flats and a white Balenciaga bag (Lesa Wallace Handbags' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/lesa-wallace/vegetable-tan-ricky-bag/product.html">Vegetable Tan Ricky Bag in Moon</a> is a more affordable version). What do you think- do you agree that the media are coming down on Lauren so hard for something she probably didn't do? Lauren took to her Myspace page to address Audrina, saying, "<I>We promised we wouldnt let people get into our ears and make us fight. You KNOW I didnt do this and I have never given you a reason not to trust me. What you are doing is hurtful and I dont want to fight with you. Whoever is telling you these things does not have your best interest at heart. I have always been there for you and now Im being attacked for something I didnt do. We are supposed to be there for each other when other people do this to us and today you are the one doing it to me. Today you are the reason people are saying mean things about me. You asked me if I did this and I told you I didnt.</i>" I for one HIGHLY doubt she would hook up with Justin- every time Lauren mentions him on the show she is basically making fun of him. What are your thoughts?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 21 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was seen posing on the red carpet of the 2008 Primetime Emmy Awards earlier tonight, September 21, held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles. Sporting a floor length, midnight blue gown of her own design (check out Holly's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/holly/maxi-long-dress-in-purple-/product.html">Maxi Long Dress in Purple</a> and Lotta Stensson's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/lotta/long-gathered-tube-dress-/product.html">Long Gathered Tube Dress in Black</a> for similar silhouettes) with a decorative pin and a simple diamond bracelet (take a look at Femme Metale's similar <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/femme-metale/royal-crest-bracelet/product.html">Royal Crest Bracelet</a>), Lauren kept her hair messily swept up as she has been at many of the recent events she has attended. Thoughts on the dress? We all know Lauren's line is simple and very, very basic- but do you think this design and color are Emmy appropriate? I think the girl looks beautiful, and simple as she may be, really can do no fashion wrong. Just my two cents! In other news in the world of Conrad, it seems that Audrina has finally moved out of the house she used to share with LC and Lo Bosworth. The girls were spotted moving Audrina's things out into a moving van, all in front of "The Hills" cameras, of course. No word on where Audrina is headed, maybe in with Justin Bobby? Thoughts??</p>

MTV darling <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted posing on the red carpet of the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards at Paramount Pictures Studios on September 7, looking pretty and sunkissed.

Add a loose, beachy updo as a finishing touch and, voila! VMA red carpet ready. For all of you "Hills" fans out there, what are your thoughts on last night's tearful episode? Lauren and Audrina finally had their big "friendship talk," in which Lauren said, "<I>Im not mad at you. I dont have bad feelings. I am just hurt. I feel like I am trying so hard to be friends with someone who just doesnt have any interest in being my friend. The worst part at the end of the day is that you were one of my best friends and I feel like I have completely lost that. Ive lost another friend. I am so tired of trying to make you be my friend. I feel pathetic.</i>" All in all though, the girls decided to let the past be the past and tearfully hugged as they vowed to move forward in getting their BFF-ness back. What do you think- are Audrina and Lauren finally out of their dramatic slump, or will there be, in typical "Hills" fashion, more drama between these two besties?</p>

My thoughts on the hair? Super cute! For her outfit, Lauren paired a tank dress (check out similar silhouette's from Qi, like <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/qi/tank-dress-in-arctic-white/product.html">Tank Dress in Arctic White</a>, and Autumn Cashmere, like the luxurious <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/autumn-cashmere/flower-babydoll-dress-/product.html">Flower Babydoll Dress in Black Winter</a>) with black sandals (like Matiko Footwear's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/matiko-footwear/katia-sandal/product.html">Katia Sandal in Black</a>) and square sunglasses (check out JeeVice Optics' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/jeevice-optics/red-hot-/product.html">Red Hot Sunglasses in Brown Fade</a>). And I must mention that Lauren had a security escort with her at Whole Foods the whole time, just to be safe. You know you've hit the big time when you need a personal security guard! While many people criticize Lauren's clothing line for being too plain and say that she probably doesn't even design the line at all, Lauren is speaking out about how she feels about the current state of her line. She says, "<I>I will probably never have the respect I want in the fashion industry, but I can work hard every day to try and prove myself</i>." Do you agree that Conrad will probably never be taken seriously and respected as a designer, or do you think that as she matures, so will her line?</p>

"Hills" starlet <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was photographed out and about in West Hollywood on August 13, carrying along a can of Diet Coke and her trademark quilted Chanel.

As I'm sure you're aware, the 4th (and probably final) season of "The Hills" premieres on Monday, and Lauren is already speaking out about her love life (or lack thereof) on the show. Rumors have spread that she is dating "My Boys" star Kyle Howard, although Lauren has denied this and claims that they're just friends. Of her love life, though, she says, "<I>My love life is an absolute trainwreck. And half of my friends are guys Its kind of embarrassing, because youre out with a group of friends and the next day it says youre dating one of them and lap dancing, too. You have to say, You know, Im sorry, but that kind of comes with the territory..</i>" Okay, I have to ask- how many of you are excited for the season 4 premiere?</p>

Conrad confirmed that she will be designing one or two dresses for the onstage tropy girls, saying, "<I>It's a huge compliment. Im doing one. I may be doing two. Its a huge compliment to be asked to do that, and it was really amazing to be taken seriously.</i>" Regarding the rumors that Lauren doesn't have any part in designing her line, she commented, saying, "<i>I didnt even really respond to the rumors because they were so silly. It was someone who knew how important the line is to me and knew that that would hurt me.</i>" I guess that shows all the people that doubted her design ability... not just anyone gets asked to design gowns for the Emmy's!</p>

For the rest of her outfit, Lauren paired multiple gold charm necklaces (like Maya Brenner Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/maya-brenner/the-charm-ing-necklace-in-gold-/product.html">The Charm-ing Necklace in Gold</a>) with a skinny belt (similar to Jack Rabbit Collection's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/jack-rabbit-collection/tale-of-two-buckles-belt-in-cognac-/product.html">Tale of Two Buckles Belt in Cognac</a>) and her "LAUREN" ring. Delicious! Now I have to wonder- what shoes was Ms. Conrad wearing? Since her dress is so long, she might have been wearing Uggs under there and all of us are none the wiser. I would totally do that if I was famous. Lauren scooped up the Choice TV Female Reality/Variety Star Award, and her show nabbed the Choice TV Celebrity Reality Award at the awards. Agree, disagree? In other Lauren news, it seems that she might have a new boy for the summer. Rumors are circulating that Conrad is getting quite cozy with actor Kyle Howard (he does somewhat resemble her ex, Jason Wahler), but when Lauren was asked if she was seeing Kyle, she replied, "<I>I'm just dating. I'm single and having fun.</i>" This is not what other sources are saying, as one source who was at the Project Beach House at the same time as Lauren told press, "<I>They were almost on top of each other</i>." Ah, summer love!</p>

Along with Mischa Barton, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was also spotted out at Key Club in Hollywood last night, July 28, not looking to pleased to see the lingering paps. In a sleek black ensemble with vivid pops of color, Lauren made a haste exit from the club and hopped into a waiting car. To get Conrad's outfit, start with a sexy black cami, like Beau Soleil's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/beau-soleil/beau-tini-top-in-midnight-/product.html">Beau Tini Top in Midnight</a>, and pair with an eye-catching lightweight scarf (check out Elizabeth Gillett Ltd's iridescent <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/elizabeth-gillett-ltd/delphina-in-black/product.html">Delphina Shawl in Black</a>) and an armful of bangles (check out Christie Martin Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/christie-martin/disc-and-tag-bracelet-in-sterling-silver/product.html">Disc and Tag Bracelet in Sterling Silver</a>).

And it seems that Lauren may have needed this night out, as <i>Star Magazine</i> is reporting this week that Lauren recently broke down in tears in her Hollywood Hills home and that her everpresent smile is masking a deep sadness within. A source says, "<I>She's an emotional train wreck. She usually doesn't lose it like that. But her life has spiraled out of control, and once she opened the floodgates, it was all over. She just crumpled, putting her head in her hands and sobbed</i>." Poor Lauren, I hope that's not true! I do understand why she might be reduced to tears, however; in the past week alone, she has been accused of not designing her clothing line (which was dropped by Kitson) and rumors spread that she was a major diva at a charity event, in addition to the constant "Lauren is fighting with Audrina" rumors that are out there. Poor thing- this is definitely the time to show your support for "The Hills" starlet!</p>

You have to keep promoting it</i>." Hey, Lauren's a busy girl!</p>

In an interview in the new issue of <i>LA Direct</i> magazine, Conrad speaks out about the dichotomy of her real self and her television self.

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Jun 19 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted by photogs texting away while spending the day running errands with galpal Lo Bosworth in LA on June 19, putting her hair up in a cute curled ponytail. Lauren started her casual look with a ruffled top (check out Gold Hawk's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/gold-hawk/sleeveless-solid-ruffle-top/product.html">Sleeveless Solid Ruffle Top in Soft Praline</a> or Zoa's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/zoa-ltd/polka-dot-ruffle-blouse-/product.html">Polka Dot Ruffle Blouse in Coffee</a> for similar options</a>) and skinny dark denim (like Joe's Jeans' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/joes-jeans/cigarette-jean-in-kennedy-wash-15687/product.html">Cigarette Super Slim Jean in Kennedy</a>), paired with t-strap sandals and Chloe shades.

Cute and simple! In related news, Lo recently graduated from UCLA, and all of "The Hills" girls (including Lauren, Audrina and Stephanie Pratt) helped her celebrate with a dinner out at Hollywood hotspot Kumo followed by bottle service at Green Door. A source said, "<I>They all seemed to get along fine.  At the beginning of dinner Audrina was a little out of it but she settled in and all the girls were talking together, having a fun time. Still, everyone was having a good time with each other things didnt seem weird.</i>" I guess the tension between Aud and LoBo has finally calmed down?</p>

Lauren spiced up her ordinary outfit with an exotic printed scarf, the perfect touch to her white cami (Yoana Baraschi's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/yoana-baraschi/heirloom-mesh-bow-cami-in-ivory-/product.html">Heirloom Mesh Bow Cami in Ivory</a> is a flirty choice) and black skinnies (like Denim of Virtue's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/denim-of-virtue/patience-5-pocket-tapered-jean-in-black-/product.html">Patience 5 Pocket Tapered Jean in Black</a>) combo. Conrad accessorized with a pair of large shades (similar to Nour's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nour/noushi-in-crystal-mystery/product.html">Noushi Sunglasses in Crystal Mystery</a>), a Chanel bag and an armful of bangles. It seems that tension is growing high in the house that Lauren shares with "Hills" costars Lo Bosworth and Audrina Patridge, so much so that sources say Audrina might be moving out. A source tells <I>Page Six, "She (Audrina) hasnt officially moved out yet, but she stays with different people. Its grown so bad between them she doesnt want to be there. If her star starts to burn brighter than Laurens, theres going to be trouble.</i>" So what do you think, is Audrina the new Heidi?</p>

"The Hills" starlets are starting to look so much alike lately I might confuse them for twins if I didn't know any better! Lauren stuck to a classy LBD (like Guy Baxter's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/guy-baxter/bari-jumper-in-black-/product.html">Bari Dress in Black</a>) and Loubs, while Lo paired a teal tank (like Zoa's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/zoa-ltd/double-braided-neckline-top/product.html">Double Braided Neckline Top</a>) with a high-waisted black mini (Parameter's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/parameter/high-waist-mini-skirt-in-black/product.html">High Waist Mini Skirt in Black</a> is similar) and chunky black heels. The night before, the girls (including Audrina!) celebrated pal Frankie Delgado's birthday at Cut and then headed over to LAX for a night of drinking and dancing. Oh, to be young and on a reality show! With all of this jetsetting, one might think that this perky pair would just want to take a night or two off... but then again, when they get paid to party, I can understand why they make so many personal event appearances! What do you think- when will Lauren Conrad, et al.'s  15 finally be up? Or will it ever?</p>

While we all know that Audrina Patridge has been caught in the middle of Lauren and Heidi Montag's WW3, she played both sides of the field as she planned her birthday party a while back. A source says,"<I>Lauren threw Audrina a bash at the house they share. She wanted to do something special for her because they had a rough year. But the next night, Audrina partied with Heidi Montag! Audrina's parents put together an invitation-only, casino-themed party for her at their Orange County home, and Audrina really wanted Heidi to be there, since the girls have become close again.</i>" Way to avoid an awkward run in, Aud!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on May 13 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted by shutterbugs (and doesn't seem to be too happy about it) leaving STK restaurant in West Hollywood on May 13, and don't you just love that big arm and hand coming from outside the image totally telling everyone to back up! Lauren stepped out for the night in a vibrant blue dress, presumably from the Lauren Conrad Collection, although Prarie New York's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/prairie-new-york/strapless-silk-dress-/product.html">Strapless Silk Dress in Cobalt</a> is similar, and has added crystal detailing at the bust. Lauren accessorized her look with a python clutch (similar to Julie K Handbags' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/julie-k-handbags/envie-python-clutch-/product.html">Envie Python Clutch in Yellow Python</a>), gold bangles, a silver pendant necklace (check out Jessica Elliot's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/jessica-elliot/diamond-istanbul-pendant-necklace-/product.html">Diamond Istanbul Pendant Necklace in Silver</a>), and yet another variation on her hairstyle du jour, the braid. While "The Hills" had its season finale last week, the world is abuzz over the fact that not all is well in Lauren's West Hollywood paradise. Fans are now taking sides- Team Audrina VS. Team Lo, due to the fact that the show is painting the picture that Lo (Lauren's friend of 12 years) is coming in between Lauren and Audrina's friendship. I am totally Team Lo, as these two have been friends forever and have a real connection, in addition to the fact that they have constantly tried to include slash reach out to Aud, but that is just my two cents. Whose team are YOU on?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on May 06 2008 in New York, NY. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> is the latest celeb to head to New York, and was spotted here arriving in NYC on May 6. I just realized that Lauren's style is very similar to Rachel Bilson's; casual and yet always very put together. Lauren started her "jeans and tee" look with a white tee (check out Los Angeles Royalty's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/los-angeles-royalty/bamboo-tee-in-white/product.html">Bamboo Tee in White</a>) and (of course) very dark wash denim (similar to Joe's Jeans' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/joes-jeans/chelsea-jean-in-reed-/product.html">Chelsea Jean in Reed</a>) tucked into black Minnetonka Moccasins. Accessory wise, Lauren kept it pretty basic, sticking to a patterned sheer silk scarf and silver bracelets (like Mickey Lynn Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/mickey-lynn/set-of-3-hammered-bracelets-in-silver-/product.html">Hammered Bracelet Set in Silver</a>) and necklaces (check out Maya Brenner Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/maya-brenner/world-peace-necklace-in-silver/product.html">World Peace Necklace in Silver</a>). As I'm sure you're already aware, tonight is the season finale of season 3 of "The Hills" on MTV, which will also air a pre-show and after-show for their ratings juggernaut. <i>BuddyTV</i> is describing the finale as "<I>Audrina feeling threatened by Lauren Conrad's close friendship with Lo.  Feeling shut out by the two, Audrina is bitten by the bug to move out on her own, prompting Lauren to make a heartfelt effort to mend things with her.  Finally, Spencer Pratt fears the worst that Heidi will be lost to him for good when he finds out she's accepted a gig in Las Vegas.</i>" Always with the drama! Will you be watching??</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on May 05 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted running errands around LA on May 5, rockin' the gladiator sandals with her easy Spring look. To nab Lauren's style, start with a breezy white tank (like Joe's Jeans' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/joes-jeans/isley-pleated-top-/product.html">Isley Pleated Top in Bone</a>, which also comes in an awesome teal color) and denim shorts (for an alternative to Lauren's casual cutoffs, check out Tag Jeans' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tag-clothing/double-belted-short-/product.html">Double Belted Short in Light Wash</a>). Next up, pile on the gold necklaces and bracelets, and snag a pair of killer square shades (similar to JeeVice Optics' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/jeevice-optics/red-hot-/product.html">Red Hot Sunglasses in Brown Fade</a>). Finishing touch? Lauren cheekily wore a leopard print bra under her tank, and if you are heading to the pool and/or beach anytime soon, take a peek at Nina Swimwear's adorable <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nina-swimwear/robbie-bikini-in-brown-/product.html">Robbie Bikini in Brown</a> or Tyler Rose's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/tyler-rose-swimwear/the-jayne-suit-/product.html">The Jayne Suit in Animal Print</a>. It seems that the testosterone-fueled readers of <i>Maxim</i> think that the fantastically plastic Heidi Montag is hotter than Conrad, as Lauren came in at number 56 in their annual "Hot List", while Heidi came in at number 21. See Heidi, all of that plastic surgery and fake tanning and bleach paid off!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 30 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was caught by photographers sleeping with the enemy AKA lunching at Urth Caffe in West Hollywood yesterday, April 30, with Stephanie Pratt, sworn enemy Spencer Pratt's sister. If you watch "The Hills," you know that Lauren and Stephanie have become quite chummy lately, leaving resident villainess Heidi Montag confused over why Lauren hates her guts for dating Spencer (umm... vicious sex tape rumors ring any bells?) but hangs out with Spence's blood relatives. So much drama up in "The Hills"! Lauren played it cool with her outfit (and seemingly newly acquired hair extensions), starting with a high-waisted mini (check out Parameter's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/parameter/high-waist-mini-skirt-in-black/product.html">High Waist Mini Skirt in Black</a>)- very typical of Lauren. Next up, Conrad tucked in a printed tank (take a fashion risk with ZG by Grimaldi's unusual <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/zg-by-grimaldi/cami-silk-tunic-in-grey-feathers-/product.html">Cami Silk Tunic in Grey Feathers</a>) to the skirt, and slipped her tootsies into a pair of gold metallic flip flops. Accessory wise, Lauren brought along her black quilted Chanel (a necessity for her), and piled on the bangles and gold necklaces (like Danielle Stevens Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/danielle-stevens-jewelry/angel-wings-necklace-in-gold/product.html">Angel Wings Necklace in Gold</a>). Finishing touch: oversized sunnies, like Nour's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nour/minou-in-manner-mania/product.html">Minou Sunglasses in Manner Mania</a>. It seems that Lauren's romantic life has been heating up lately, as she has been spotted nonstop over the past week with Doug Reinhardt, who plays for the Baltimore Orioles. In addition to hitting up Hollywood hot spots like Goa, sources say that the hot new pair filmed scenes for the show. I wonder if this one will last?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 18 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was caught by photogs visiting a friends house in LA on April 18, looking like a little ray of sunshine in her vibrant sundress (from her own line?). For a similar frock, check out Shumaq's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/shumaq/coti-dress-in-yellow-/product.html">Coti Dress in Yellow</a>. Lauren brought along one of her trademark Chanel bags for her day out and about, and further accessorized with a dainty charm necklace (like Maya Brenner Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/maya-brenner/world-peace-necklace-in-silver/product.html">World Peace Necklace in Silver</a>) and a pair of square framed shades (similar to JeeVice Optics' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/jeevice-optics/red-hot-/product.html">Red Hot Sunglasses in Brown Fade</a>). While it is no secret that much of "The Hills" is less than real, Lauren is speaking out about how drawing the line between real life and "reality television" can get a bit hazy. For instance, Conrad is not allowed to talk about what is coming up on the new season, even though media coverage is always heavy surrounding the starlet, and celebrity weeklies can't get enough "Hills" scoop. Lauren says, "<I>We find ourselves in a situation where things are being reported months and months before they show up on the show. Media will report on our everyday lives, but the thing is, our everyday lives is the television show, so it gives away what's going to happen.</i>" What a tangled web Lauren lives! She continues, "<I>That's the way the show's meant to be. It's meant to be an unscripted drama. [The Hills] does not address the celebrity that comes with it, and I probably would not be able to do [the Lauren Conrad Collection] without the celebrity that comes with the show. They chose not to include it and I didn't really want to include it because I try to separate the line and the show.</i>" This conversation is getting pretty deep.. what is your take on the show?</p>

And look at those toned legs of hers! Those training sessions that she goes to that are always aired on "The Hills" are definitely paying off. Lauren started her look with a white strapless top (check out Vanitas' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/vanitas/strapless-eyelet-top-in-cream-/product.html">Strapless Eyelet Top in Cream</a>) tucked into a high-waisted mini skirt (similar to Parameter's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/parameter/high-waist-mini-skirt-in-black/product.html">High Waist Mini Skirt in Black</a>), paired with a dainty cream cardigan (like Sydney Los Angeles' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/sydney-los-angeles/3-4-sleeve-cardigan-in-vanilla-cream-/product.html">3/4 Sleeve Cardigan in Vanilla Cream</a>). Lauren accessorized with her fave Dita shades, the gold flip flops she's taken quite a liking to lately and a classic Chanel bag. It seems that Lauren and arch nemesis Heidi Montag put aside their differences (or were getting enough to get over them for a day) as the two joined forces for a cover shoot for <i>Rolling Stone</i>, their first shoot together in over two years. Guaranteed, the cover will feature both blondes glaring evilly at each other. No doubt about that. What do you think, though- will you be picking up a copy of the mag with Lauren and Heidi gracing the cover?</p>

No 5" stilettos during the day for this girl!

Lauren also grabbed onto a white leather tote (check out Aaneta's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/aaneta/muddy-large-bag-/product.html">Muddy Large Bag in White</a>) while she perused the items at Barney's. While enemy and all-around falsity Heidi Montag has openly expressed her support of Presidential candidate John McCain, Lauren has (smartly) decided to stay politically neutral.

While many people head out to clubs to get away from the stress of their everyday lives or to just cut loose, Lauren is going out (among other reasons, I'm sure) for the paycheck! Allegedly, celebrity talent booker Mike Esterman told <i>E!</i> that Lauren is commanding up to $20,000 a night for an appearance at the hottest clubs. Man, that must be nice! Being walked into a club, given tons and tons of drinks, and a fat $20g paycheck at the end of the night. I'm sure Lauren could get used to that!</p>

Why do you think Conrad has such a long face? You think she read <i>New York Magazine</i>'s article titled "Inside the Sad, Bizarre World That Was the Lauren Conrad Show"?

Wearing a LBD from her line (Laura Dahl's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/laura-dahl/victoria-dress-/product.html">Victoria Dress in Noir</a> and Prarie New York's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/prairie-new-york/strapless-silk-dress-/product.html">Strapless Silk Dress in Black</a> are similar) with satin bow heels and some new hair extensions, LC accessorized with a few key feminine jewelry pieces, like a gold bangle (like Rachel Leigh's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/rachel-leigh/snake-bangle-in-gold/product.html">Snake Bangle in Gold</a>) and a gold charm necklace (Maya Brenner Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/maya-brenner/the-charm-ing-necklace-in-gold-/product.html">The Charm-ing Necklace in Gold</a> is similar). While the reception of Lauren's collection has been mixed (from raves to well, less than), the show drummed up of course the expected quotient of MTV-related drama. All of Lauren's closest buddies attented, like Whitney, Lo and Audrina, as well as former flame Stephen from "Laguna Beach" and Brody Jenner. Also noticeably present was Kristin Cavallari, Lauren's arch-nemesis back in her LB days. While the clothes were overall pretty vanilla, it's good to see that Lauren's making the most of her reality TV-related fame, and made her way to LA Fashion Week. Congrats!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 05 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted grabbing a quick bite at Lulu's Cafe in Los Angeles with a girlfriend yesterday, March 5, and was having like the most animated conversation ever! That facial expression really kills me. It's like a mix of suprise, excitement and fear. Amazing. To nab LC's outfit, start with a vest (check out Walter's sleek black version, the <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/walter/herringbone-vest-in-black/product.html">Herringbone Vest in Black</a>) over a black tank (I'm loving Autumn Cashmere's ultra luxurious <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/autumn-cashmere/racer-back-tank---/product.html">Racer Back Tank in Black</a>). Next up are Lauren's red Dita sunglasses (her shades du jour) and her Chanel bag.

In other Conrad news, it seems that there might just be more drama on "The Hills". How is this possible, you ask? Well, Lauren is allegedly planning to write a juicy tell-all complete with scandalous details of her young Hollywood crowd. That means you, Heidi! A source tells <I>OK! Weekly, "A chapter got leaked to Kristin Cavallari. It talks about her sleeping around Laguna and stealing Stephen Colletti.</i> LC also takes shots at Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton, although LC's rep claims that there is no truth to rumors of Lauren penning a book. Guess we'll have to wait and see. The real question, however, is- would you read it?</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 05 2008 in West Hollywood, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted at Boulevard Lounge in West Hollywood on March 5 posing with "Hills" galpals <b>Audrina Patridge</b> and <b>Whitney Port</b>, and all of the girls decided to stick with basic black for their night out. While Lauren paired a drapey black top (Lotta Stensson's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/lotta/best-top-in-black/product.html">Best Top in Black</a> is like a tube top version of Lauren's) with mid-calf black leggings (like Laura Dahl's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/laura-dahl/tiny-dancers-leggings-/product.html">Tiny Dancer Leggings in Noir</a>) and bright blue suede Christian Louboutins (the exact same pair that arch nemesis Heidi Montag was spotted wearing while shopping at Chanel earlier in the week, FYI) which were the only pop of color in the trio's outfits, Audrina and Whitney decided to stick to all black for their looks. Audrina paired a layered-looking black and white frock with black bangles (check out Accessories & Beyond's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/accessories-and-beyond/mixed-stones-and-gold-metal-leather-bangles/product.html">Mixed Stones and Gold Metal Leather Bangles</a>) and basic black heels, while Whitney went for a sort of biker-meets-ballerina look with a leather motorcycle jacket, LBD (like Doucette Duvall's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/doucette-duvall/bonnie-dress-in-black-stripes/product.html">Bonnie Dress in Black</a>) and ballerina flats (check out Matiko Footwear's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/matiko-footwear/verne-flat-/product.html">Verne Flat in Black</a>). Lauren, Audrina and other roomie Lo Bosworth held a little housewarming get together for close friends at their new West Hollywood, Spanish-style home on Friday night, and attendees included (of course) the three girls, Whitney, Brody Jenner, Stephen Colleti, and even Justin Bobby. The crew nibbled on catered Mexican food and sipped on cocktails as their girls showed off their new pad and partied out by the pool and firepit. The roomies' new puppy Chloe even made a guest appearance! Just another fabulous night in "The Hills".</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Mar 01 2008 in Beverly Hills, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted frolicking around Beverly Hills on Saturday, March 1. Keeping it casual, Conrad sported her signature simple look.

Conrad made sure to protect her eyes from the California sun by sporting her favorite pair of Dita shades (check out Nour's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nour/baba-in-oro-bianco/product.html">Baba Sunglasses in Oro Bianco</a>). After recently purchasing her new home in the Hollywood Hills, Conrad has become quite the domestic. After recent shopping trips to house ware store Crate & Barrel, Lauren has also invested in a new pup. Lauren's lab/shepherd mix (which she bought with fellow "Hills" pal Lo Bosworth), Chloe, is the latest audition to MTV's "The Hills." Will the dog create any new drama when the show comes back for its fourth season, or will she fit right in the mix? I guess we will just have to wait and see.</p>

To nab the girls' casual spring style, let's start with Lauren. Wrapping herself up in a lightweight purple top, Lauren paired a tight black tube top (check out Lotta Stensson's interesting <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/lotta/best-top-in-black/product.html">Best Top in Black</a>) with cropped black leggings (like Laura Dahl's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/laura-dahl/tiny-dancers-leggings-/product.html">Tiny Dancers Leggings in Noir</a>) and a black Chanel bag.

For those of you who are eagerly awaiting the return of "The Hills" to MTV, it seems that MTV is giving a sneak peek of what's to come to the loyal fans of the show. We all know that the upcoming eps will feature Lauren and Whitney's trip to Paris, including Lauren meeting drop dead gorg Parisian guys (which I'm sure wasn't set up by MTV  at all). And never fear, the new episodes will of course feature Heidi and Spencer, because, really... what would the show be without them?</p>

Hooray, it's about time! In other LC romance news, it seems that she and Brody Jenner have been nothing more than just friends lately. Spotted at LAX nightclub in Las Vegas on February 13, one source said that the two "<I>hugged once, but it looked innocent</i>," and that they seemed like nothing more than friends. Well that's good, seeing as Brody has a girlfriend!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 09 2008 in Los Angeles, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was caught catching up with co-worker and pal Whitney Port over lunch on Saturday, February 9. In her usual casual and never daring style, LC seemed to yet again "dress down" for the occasion. LC began her look with a pair of simple flip flops. As the weather heated up in Los Angeles, LC kept cool in a cotton black summer dress (just like Ecoganik's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/ecoganik/v-neck-babydoll-dress-in-black/product.html">V Neck Babydoll Dress in Black</a>) and accessorized with her usual jewelry, sunglasses, and a handbag.

In her attempt to look posh, she sported her usual pair of oversized square framed sunglasses (check out Nour's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nour/baba-in-oro-bianco/product.html">Baby in Oro Bianco</a>). And of course, her always black quilted black Chanel handbag; the "LC consecutive days with the Chanel" counter is back in action! Current status: day number 490! As we all remember, this bag was given to Lauren 300 years ago by ex-BF Jason Wahler. You would think when she got rid of Jason she would have tossed that bag right away too. I mean, really... how old is that bag? Lauren's calendar has been filled with tons of partying lately; after being spotted all over the place in Scottsdale last weekend for the Superbowl, we were anxious to see whether her and Brody were on again or off again. First hitting up the Playboy party with Audrina and her father, Lauren went on to hit up the Tao beach house where she ran into not only Brody Jenner, but also Kristen Cavallari drama! LC made sure to make a fast dash from there quickly. What do you have to say about all of this drama, Team Lauren or not?</p>

In an outfit consisting of a long purple sweater with black leggings (like Laura Dahl's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/laura-dahl/tiny-dancers-leggings-/product.html">Tiny Dancers Leggings in Black</a>), black shades (check out Nour's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nour/maadar-in-oro-bianco/product.html">Madaar Sunglasses in Oro Bianco</a>), gold flip flops and a black Linea Pelle bag (similar to Linea Pelle's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/linea-pelle/dylan-large-shoulder-bag-/product.html">Dylan Large Shoulder Bag in Black</a>, which also comes in Iron and Mahogany), Lauren kept her casual California style in check. In other LC news, it seems that Lauren's former boss at <i>Teen Vogue</i>, Lisa Love, is speaking out about America's most famous intern. Of how "real" the show is, Love says, "<i>I think why they say all that is because theres so much editing. They shoot reality and somehow its changed in the editing room to appeal to things, I dont know.</i>" And of Lauren's debut fashion line, Love doesn't think it's high fashion at all! She says, "<i>I think its more T-shirt kind of things and jeans, very simple basics</i>." She's got that right, I mean, Lauren's collection has basic tank tops selling for $65! Eesh!</p>

Taking a walk on the wild side by wearing a sequined zebra mini (Misile's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/misile/venezia-dress-in-black-and-white/product.html">Venezia Dress in Black and White</a> is a funky take on zebra print, and is similar to Lauren's frock), Lauren accessorized her "ready to party" look with a patent leather black clutch (like Carla Mancini's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/carla-mancini/clutch-with-lock-and-chain-in-black-patent/product.html">Clutch with Lock and Chain in Black Patent</a>) with matching heels and silver bangles on her wrist (similar to Mickey Lynn Designs' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/mickey-lynn/set-of-3-hammered-bracelets-in-silver-/product.html">Set of 3 Hammered Bracelets in Silver</a>). This has been quite a busy week for Ms. Conrad, as she celebrated her 22nd birthday with a little pre-bash last week at two LA hotspots, Katsuya and S Bar. Getting her sushi on with girlfriends (and fellow "Hills"-mates) Audrina Patridge, Lo Bosworth and Whitney Port at Katsuya, it seems that the evening did not go as planned for the starlet. According to <i>E Online</i>, Lauren took the celebration a little too far as she spent the majority of the night dealing with the consequences of drinking past her limit in the bathroom. A source says, "<i>Camera crews were set up at S Bar, patiently waiting to film scenes for "The Hills", but the birthday girl was throwing up in the bathroom. They finally just decided to call the whole shoot off due to L.C.'s sickness</i>." Hang in there girl, everyone has definitely been there. It's all about knowing your limit, though!</p>

I'm seriously starting the "LC consecutive days with the Chanel" counter. Current status: day number 489! Wearing a cute and casual outfit consisting of a plaid jacket (check out Johnson's cute cropped version, the <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/johnson/crop-jacket-in-wednesday/product.html">Crop Jacket in Wednesday</a>) over a white tee (like Rails' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/rails/kenna-scoop-t-/product.html">Kenna Scoop Tee in White</a>) and skinny black jeans (similar to Denim of Virtue's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/denim-of-virtue/patience-5-pocket-tapered-jean-/product.html">Patience 5 Pocket Tapered Jean in Black</a>).

The day that Lauren steps out carrying a DIFFERENT designer bag will seriously be a red letter day in my book! While the starlet seems to be popping up everywhere lately, it seems that she will be followed by her "Hills" camera crew for quite some time to come. Conrad spoke to <i>US Weekly</i> recently, saying, "<i>We'll film till some kind of conclusion happens in our lives</i>." When asked how long she sees herself shooting the show, she replied, "<i>I dont know. Im just having fun with it now. We had two weeks off during Christmas, and it was really nice to have a break. But at the same time you miss the crew. The crew members are really good friends of ours so its kind of cool to get back into it.</i> Who are you kidding Lauren, you're going to be filming reality TV until you're a silver haired granny!</p>

"Hills" star <b>Lauren Conrad</b> was spotted partying and striking poses with fellow castmates Lo Bosworth and Audrina Patridge at LAX nightclub in Las Vegas on December 30, sporting what looks like a new, shorter 'do. If she really did get a few inches taken off, I think it will be a great change for '08! Each girl was decked out in an adorable and stylish party dress as they partied the night away; for a dress like Lauren's, check out Karen Zambos' playful <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/karen-zambos/velvet-tube-dress-in-white/product.html">Velvet Tube Dress in White</a>, for a similar style to Lo's frock, take a look at LaROK's similar <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/larok/julia-short-dress-in-vist/product.html">Julia Short Dress in Vista</a> (they're both the same champagne-y shade), and to nab Audrina's look, opt for Betsey Johnson's flirty <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/betsey-johnson/ruffle-dress-in-black-/product.html">Ruffle Dress in Black</a>. It seems that contrary to previous reports, there was no big old dramatic New Years Eve confrontation with Lauren and former "Laguna Beach" nemesis Kristin Cavallari, but instead Lauren was seen smooching a mystery man just days after she was spotted necking with former flame Stephen Colletti! Lauren and Audrina hosted a NYE bash at the McClellan-Palomar Airport in San Diego (talk about random), and were allegedly paid a cool $20g each for hosting. Not too shabby! However, Lauren was reportedly seen kissing this so-called mystery man at midnight, as well as when she was getting ready to leave the event. I wonder who this mystery man is, and if he will be popping up on "The Hills" any time soon!</p>

In a casual-chic outfit consisting of a sheer printed top (check out Karen Zambos' <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/karen-zambos/bell-sleeve-top-/product.html">Bell Sleeve Top in Opal</a> for something similar) with a funky necklace (like Kuo Ting Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/kuoting/puffed-coin-bead-necklace/product.html">Puffed Coin Bead Necklace</a>) and black leather bag (similar to Aaneta's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/aaneta/the-rock-large-in-black-/product.html">The Rock Large Bag in Black</a>). Of course, LC finished off her look with a pair of black leggings... I wonder if Lauren and Lindsay Lohan had to battle it out for sole ownership of black leggings who would win? Talk about a fight to the death! While she was waiting for her car from the valet, Lauren spoke to a few press about her current dating situation. She said, "<i>I'm not really searching for anyone.  I'm just going
out and having fun. I'm not dating anyone.</i>" In regards to pick-up lines, Lauren specifically said that she will not go for any cheesy lines. Lauren's dating life is lactose intolerant! She said, "<i>I want [a guy] that comes up and approaches you but in a non-cheesy way.</i>" Don't we all, Lauren, don't we all.</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 22 2007 in Los Angeles, CA. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> and fellow "Hills" buddy <b>Audrina Patridge</b> spent last Thursday afternoon, November 22, living their tough life, which consisted of (what else) shopping and lunching! Lauren went back to black in her basic ensemble consisting of a black sweater (just like Woo's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/staci-woo/bella-top-in-black/product.html">Bella Top in Black</a>) with leggings (like Hudson Jeans' longer <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/hudson-jeans/skinny-leg-knit-in-black/product.html">Skinny Leg Knit in Black</a>), a knit cap, decorative flats and a big black shoulder bag (I'm loving Linea Pelle's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/linea-pelle/dylan-large-shoulder-bag-/product.html">Dylan Large Shoulder Bag in Black</a>), while Audrina dazzled in a playful bejeweled tunic top with leggings as well and casual flip flops. The two hit up Mauro's Cafe inside Fred Segal and then shopped 'til they dropped, with Lauren staying hydrated on not one but FOUR beverages throughout the day (a Diet Coke, an Evian, a Red Bull and a pink slushie, in case you were wondering). Lauren has been off living her fabulous life in Paris lately (and of course bringing "The Hills" camera crew along with her), so it seems that she will not be remembered as the "girl who didn't go to Paris" any longer. However, there is already some gossip about her Parisian adventure, as Perez Hilton reported that a hunky guy has been hired by MTV producers to show LC around the city, amongst other things. Casting a member of the show? Now that's just impossible (cough Audrina cough).</p>

Currently, fashionistas like Ashlee Simpson and La Lohan can't get enough of 'em, and Lauren picked a patterned blue and tan scarf to complement her otherwise simple and chic. Wearing dark skinny jeans (like 7 for All Mankind's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/7-for-all-mankind/lucy-jean-in-mar-/product.html">Lucy Jean in Marine</a>) tucked into boots, a black tank (check out Hank Vintage Threads' cute <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/hank-vintage-threads/butterfly-tank-in-black/product.html">Butterfly Tank in Black</a> and brown shades (Nour's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nour/kiara-in-manner-mania/product.html">Kiara Sunglasses in Manner Mania</a>), Audrina kept her outfit simple as well in a flirty white top (like Paper Denim & Cloth's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/paper-denim-and-cloth/cotton-dobby-blouse-in-winter-white/product.html">Cotton Dobby Blouse in Winter White</a>) and vintage-wash jeans (similar to Deener's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/deener/charmer-slim-boot-jean-in-sodium/product.html">Charmer Slim Boot Jean in Sodium</a>) with flip flops. Like I report with basically every Lauren entry, there is STILL a lot of drama surrounding the authenticity of "The Hills", to which Lauren finally felt like she had to address. She tells <i>US Weekly</i>, "<i>There have been some rumors in the press about "The Hills" being fake. Many of you have been asking me if the rumors are true. There are false rumors every week about me and I cant address every rumor out there, but I feel like this was important for me to respond to. The show is not fake and this is really my life.</i>" Hmm... what do you think? Do you take LC's word for it, or do you think that some and/or most of the show is staged?</p>

While "The Hills" has been catching a lot of flack lately for people thinking it's fake, <i>Star Magazine</i> is now claiming that Lauren and Heidi might actually be friends! Allegedly, the girls were seen together in the parking garage of Lauren's apartment on the weekend before Halloween, laughing and getting into Lauren's black Mercedes. A source says, "<i>They were laughing, hugging and being very affectionate with one another. There were no MTV cameras around. This seemed like the real deal. I saw Heidi coming to visit Lauren at her apartment without her fiancé Spencer Pratt. I think Lauren and Heidi made a secret pact not to tell anyone.</i>" Either that, or they've made up and can't be seen out in public together until the episode airs! However, this doesn't seem likely, as a preview of this week's episode shows Lauren telling Heidi, "<I>I want to forgive you, and I want to forget you.</i>" Hmm... I've said it before and I'm sure I'll say it again- something's fishy in the Hills!</p>

Cheer up girl, your show is a hit! It might be fake, but it's still a hit! Wait wait wait... you didn't hear all of the goss circulating lately regarding the authenticity of "The Hills"? Just last week, Perez Hilton posted screen-shots from the show of LC on her date with male-model Gavin, and post-date when she called Brody to tell him how lame the date was and that she wanted to hang with him instead. On the date, red nails. After the date, clear polish. Something's fishy in the Hills! Now there are rumors that Heidi doesn't really work at Bolthouse and Audrina doesn't work at Sony... I wonder what is actually real on this supposed "reality" show! And what do you think, does it matter if certain things are staged or re-created for the sake of entertainment?</p>

Wearing a a drapey white top (Laura Dahl's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/laura-dahl/york-in-nior/product.html">York Top in Winter White</a> has a similar shape) with skinny dark jeans (like Aristocrat's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/aristocrat/kent-jean-in-nordic/product.html">Kent Jean in Nordic</a>), a funky necklace (like Castaway Jewelry's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/castaway/paradise-lost-4/product.html">Brass Leaves, Obsidian Horn & Quartz Hoop Necklace</a>) and her favorite crimson colored bag of-late (like Linea Pelle's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/linea-pelle/angie-medium-bag-in-crimson-/product.html">Angie Medium Bag in Crimson</a>), Lauren looks cool and casual. While the rumors have been running rampant lately that a majority of what happens on "The Hills" is fake or staged, co-star Audrina Patridge is speaking out about how real the show is. While the word is that Audrina doesn't even work at Sony, like they portray on the show, she says, "<i>Everything is real. Lauren and me are real friends. We live in our apartment. Thats real, like where we work, everything. The situations are real</i>." Glad she cleared that up, although I know first hand that one of the things that Audrina said is real is <i>definitely</i> not... anyone willing to guess?</p>

Even when cozying up in a big sweater, girl's still gotta wear her sandals! For those of you "Hills" fans out there, I'm sure you are just dying to know more of what happened between Brody and Lauren in Vegas from what was featured on this week's episode. Well, it seems like it's going to have to be left to your imagination. While we know that the two sneaked some kisses and even cuddled up to one another for a drunken nap, Brody is speaking out, and not really filling in to many gaps. He says that "<I>There was a lot of things they didnt show. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.</i> I guess there are still guys out there that don't kiss and tell! Brody continues that he talks to Lauren "<I>every day, its just like any other friend.</i>" Hmm, friend... or friend with benefits??

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Sep 28 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. "Hills" starlet <b>Lauren Conrad</b> and her co-star, Whitney Port, were photographed looking chic and sophisticated at the Declare Yourself 2007 party on September 28, rocking the black and red look. While LC  slipped into a sexy black tube dress (like Lotta Stensson's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/lotta/gathered-minitube-dress-in-black/product.html">Gathered Mini Tube Dress in Black</a>) with black heels (check out Matiko Footwear's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/matiko-footwear/lisa-heel/product.html">Lisa Heel in Black</a>), Whitney stood out in Crispin & Basilio's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/crispin-and-basilio/tuxedo-top-in-red-/product.html">Tuxedo Top in Red</a> and black tights- and both girls flaunted bright red nails. Considering the fact that the show is MTV's top-rated program of the moment, Lauren is definitely the network's golden girl, meaning that what she says goes! The chic phenom was flirting with the idea of not filming a third season of her hit show because she would have to share screen time and be forced to interact with BFF turned arch-nemesis Heidi Montag and her "fiance" Spencer Pratt. Lauren recently told "Seventeen" that she "came dangerously close to not doing season three, because I really didn't want to do the show with Heidi and Spencer." Apparently, just the thought of sharing publicity with the couple sent shivers down her spine, yet MTV convinced Lauren to stick it out. I'm sure they made it well worth her while, if you know what I mean! While Lauren has been working on her clothing line recently, Heidi has been popping up on the cover of "US Weekly" with the headline reading "Revenge Plastic Surgery". Lauren (not one to miss out on taking a jab at Heidi's life) has spoke out about Heidi's surgery, saying "I don't think revenge is a good reason to get plastic surgery," Lauren smiled. "If you get plastic surgery, it should be for yourself." Zing! This is shaping up to be the reality television feud of the decade!</p>

What she also knows is that her debut clothing line will be a big hit, because "The Hills" is currently MTV's most-watched show. The line is exclusively available online, and launched on Saturday- the same day as rival Heidi Montag's 21st birthday. Smooth, Lauren- tryin' to steal the thunder! Lauren's line (creatively titled "Lauren Conrad") is full of cute essentials, if you don't mind paying $135 for a basic jersey dress. Seems like looking like the "Hills" starlets doesn't come cheap!</p>

The internet was abuzz these past few days that Lauren would be walking in Marc Jacobs' show in New York for fashion week and models didn't seem to be very happy about this. Allegedly, the models complained that they were going to have to sign releases so that they can be filmed for Lauren's reality show. Oh please- like they wouldn't jump at the chance to be on MTV's number one rated show! But worry not models... Lauren's not going to be stealing your spotlight; Marc only hired her to work on the show. And just think, Lauren came from being a Laguna Beach babe to being a stylish runway assistant. Thank you MTV!</p>

Wearing a casual LBD (LaROK's <a href=" http://www.couturecandy.com/larok/zednc-party-mini/product.html">Paillette Dress in Black</a> is a much ritzier, dressy version of Lauren's dress; Karen Zambos' <a href=" http://www.couturecandy.com/karen-zambos/slip-dress-in-black-/product.html">Slip Dress in Black</a> is also similar) with metallic silver sandals and a big white bag (check out Dutchy Handbags' <a href=" http://www.couturecandy.com/dutchy/nana-tote-in-bone/product.html">Nana Tote in Bone</a>), Lauren was showing that simple summertime style that she's known for (but where's the headband?). Now that Heidi and Spencer have made such a big fat deal about how Ryan Seacrest released the wrong single on his radio show, it seems that everyone has heard Heidi's track, "Body Language". When Lauren was asked on the most recent after-show for "The Hills" if she's heard Heidi's song, she said she hadn't. However, I'm thinking that she probably has but doesn't want to seem like Heidi or her musical aspirations take up any of her precious time. LC also spoke up to <i>In Touch Magazine</i>, saying that "<I> I promise you: I'll never release an album! I don't really have very many talents! I'm OK with it, though. I think as far the entertainment industry is concerned, the abilities to act and sing are something you are born with or have to work very hard at, and I don't have either talent, so I'm not going to pretend like I do!</i>" Sounds like a not-so-thinly veiled stab at Heidi to me!</p>

She says that she used to "<I>get too attached to a guy, then I get all emotional and, like, then we break up and whatever happens. I just want to have fun with dating. And when you break up, it's always the girl sitting around being so upset about it, and then the guy's out dating the next week.

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Jul 01 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. As the whole MTV-watching world is getting ready for the new season premiere of The Hills, <b>Lauren Conrad</b> is spending the beginning of her summer hitting up events and seeing a lot of a new guy. Lauren attended Chris Evans and Eric Podwalls Annual Birthday Bash at the Wallop Lounge at Eleven on July 1, wearing a deeply cut blue top (lets hope that she took advantage of boob tape!) like Harkhams more casual <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/harkham/liquid-jersey-top-in-mist/product.html">Liquid Jersey Tee</a> with dark <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/james-jeans/5-pocket-skinny-leg-in-troy/product.html">skinny jeans</a> and a long, black rope she tied around her waist like a belt. Lauren showed up at the fete with Paris Hiltons ex, and Desperate Housewives actor, Josh Henderson, who she is rumored to be hooking up with. Apparently, the two were seen canoodling at the bash, and left the party hand in hand, where a source says that the two were on their way home together. Although its pretty well known that Josh and Paris were dating as a publicity stunt (where was he during her time in the slammer?), I wonder if the same can be said for him and Lauren? Maybe if everything goes as planned, hell be appearing on upcoming episodes of The Hills. Or was that merely his intention from the beginning? Hmm</p>

"Hills" star <b>Lauren Conrad</b> appeared at an opening of Starbucks (a Starbucks opening is a celebrity event now?) in her hometown of Laguna Beach with friend and new roomie Audrina Patridge on June 23. Lauren and Audrina seemed to wear almost identical dresses in different colors (Vanitas' <a href=" http://www.couturecandy.com/vanitas/liberty-mini-dress-in-black/product.html">Liberty Mini Dress in Black</a> and Laura Dahl's <a href=" http://www.couturecandy.com/laura-dahl/billie-in-black/product.html">Billie Dress in Black</a> are similar to Lauren's dress, while Woo's <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/staci-woo/kai-dress-in-kelly-/product.html">Kai Dress in Kelly Green</a> resembles Audrina's), coincidence or new BFF's coordinating outfits together? I'm leaning obviously towards the latter. With season 3 of "The Hills" fast approaching, these two are out there appearing at just about any and every event (once again, Starbucks?) together, and Audrina seems to be in the prime position to become the show's new Heidi, always with Lauren and living with her- I just hope she won't ditch Lauren as a friend over some annoying loser à la Heidi!  While Heidi and her (to quote Lauren) "sucky person" fiancé Spencer have been popping up for obviously staged photo ops lately (hello, did you check out the pictures of them eating ice cream and Heidi flashing her huge rock for the cameras?), Lauren has been hanging with friends and of course has kept busy filming. Now, the trailer for the upcoming season has hit YouTube, and it looks like there's a major Lauren/Heidi catfight brewing towards the end of the clip! Now I know that this "reality" show is many people's guilty pleasure, but I just have to say that I am glad Lauren's friend Lo will be featured this season- she was always my favorite!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on May 17 2007 in New York, NY. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> hit the streets of New York on May 17 for a photo shoot for Avons line of cosmetics named Mark, looking cute and girl-next-door-ish as ever. Dressed in a funny little hat and scarf over a long sleeve <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/3cp/louvre-mirrow-long-sleeve-in-white/
product.html">white tee</a> and denim mini (like Deeners <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/deener/mixer-mini-in-lead-/product.html
">Mixer Mini</a>), Lauren went for her usual simple yet stylish look. While she was all smiles on the set of the photo shoot, I wonder whether or not she was smiling when she heard of ex-BFF, Heidi Montags, engagement to total idiot Spencer Pratt? Heidi was always there for Lauren when she went though breakups and hook-ups, that is, until Spence slimed his way into their lives. Now, Lauren says that she has <I>great family and friends that love me and know what really happens, and thats all that matters. People are always going to make up talk, so you really just cant let it phase you. I mean, it obviously hurts and its really hard to deal with, but Ive kind of learned to let it go.</I> So mature! Lauren is also so responsible, saying how she realizes that she has sort of become a role model to little girls all over. Lauren says that <I>when fans come up to me, a lot of them are little girls and thats a really good reminder that I am responsible for what kids are looking up to. You dont want some of your behavior - that may be acceptable for a 21 year old - to been seen as cool by younger girls.</I> Amen!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on May 08 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. Is <b>Lauren Conrad</b> just finding out that Paris is headed to the slammer? Is she on the phone with ex-BFF Heidi finding out that she is the one who spread those nasty sex-tape rumors? Don't know, but it's clear that Lauren is clearly shocked about something! At LAX on May 8, Lauren was spotted wearing skinny jeans (like these <a href=" http://www.couturecandy.com/paper-denim-and-cloth/cin-super-low-straight-leg-in-1-year/product.html"> Paper Denims</a>), a <a href=" http://www.couturecandy.com/cake-couture/regent-shirt-in-white/product.html"> white button-down</a> with the sleeves rolled up, and her trademark headband and Tory Burch flats. Lauren was headed to New York for a photo shoot for Mark cosmetics, and while she was taking a break from shooting outside of the Gansevoort Hotel, the paparazzi were going crazy as always. But when a makeup-free Drew Barrymore walked out of the hotel's door, the paps shifted their attention from Lauren almost immediately! When they were done shooting Drew, it was back to the perky "Hills" starlet. Wonder if they were filming her show while all of this went down!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Apr 26 2007 in Hollywood, Ca. <b>Lauren Conrad</b> hit up Us Weekly's Hot Hollywood Party last night, April 26, and stuck with her usual simplistic style. In an almost side-boob revealing black bubble dress (Karen Zambos' <a href=" http://www.couturecandy.com/karen-zambos/cross-bubble-dress-in-black/product.html"> Cross Bubble Dress</a> is similar, but a little less revealing) with black peeptoes and a gold ring, Lauren looked bronzed and happy, in light of all the drama she's been dealing with lately. For those of who you don't follow the career of "The Hills" darling, she's been beating off sex-tape rumors with a stick! Allegedly, she made a sex tape with ex-boyfriend, the scumbag known as Jason Wahler, which Jason wanted to sell to make some quick cash before heading off to the slammer. Lauren always denied any and all existence of the tape, which both Perez Hilton and TMZ.com reported on. So, nobody really knew the truth. Was there a tape out there and Lauren was just lying in order to maintain her good-girl image? Was the whole thing a rumor with absolutely no substance? A few of these answers have now been revealed. Apparently, the porn company that was going to be purchasing the tape for distribution decided to take a pass, because the tape was too "vanilla", and not hardcore enough. Kind of like LC herself.. as cute and sweet as vanilla!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 22 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. As many of you know, the MTV hit reality show "The Hills", chronicling little fashionista <b>Lauren Conrad</b>'s tumultuous life in Los Angeles, is very easy to be swept up in. Over the past few weeks, things have gotten pretty topsy turvy in the hills, as Lauren and BFF Heidi are on the skids over the fact that Heidi's sheisty boyfriend Spencer is being just that, shiesty, and LC doesn't want to see her best friend get hurt. But now there is a weird tension between the two.. and it's only getting worse by the day! After Spencer and his best friend Brody Jenner, who dated Lauren for a nanosecond, talked trash about everyone in the latest issue of <i>Details</i>, Lauren purposefully did not attend the US Weekly Oscar Party (which was co-hosted by "The Hills"!) because she couldn't stand to be in Spencer's presence. Sources tell us that Heidi and Spencer attended (with a bodyguard in tow.. pshh like these two need a bodyguard) and were looking cozy all night, even though Heidi said that she wished Lauren was there. Tres tragic!</p>
<p>All this drama did not stop Lauren from keeping her head up and attending other pre-Oscar parties and gatherings. On February 22, Lauren hit up the Haven House Oscar Suite to pose with some goodies (hey, those pink iPods aren't going to sell themselves!), looking cute in a pair of <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/joes-jeans/cigarette-skinny-jean-in-otis-/product.html"> dark skinny jeans</a>, Tory Burch flats, a nautical <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/heatherette/anchor-sweater-in-black/product.html"> striped sweater</a> and <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/raw-7/solid-black-scarf/product.html"> black scarf</a>. I just hope Lauren and Heidi can rekindle that friendship of theirs, and that Heidi kicks Spencer to the proverbial curb!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Feb 06 2007 in Los Angeles, Ca. As <b>Lauren Conrad</b> attended the Betsey Johnson show at LA's Fashion Week in February with new BFF and roomie Audrina Patridge, in dresses like these from <a href=" http://www.couturecandy.com/karen-zambos/bow-tube-dress-in-heather-grey/product.html"> Karen Zambos</a> and <a href=" http://www.couturecandy.com/karanina/greta-dress-in-garnet-jitterbug/product.html"> Karanina</a>, everyone was wondering, "Where's Heidi?" With the finale of this super-entertaining season of "The Hills" ending with Heidi ditching Lauren and moving in with bonehead BF Spencer, everyone was wondering whether or not Lauren and Heidi remained as close, or if Spencer accomplished what he set out to do: break up the best friends. <i>US Weekly</i> is reporting that a "Hills source" (oh geez) is saying  that "<i>Lauren and Heidi are no longer friends. They never talk or hang out. Spencer achieved his goal and broke them apart.</i>" Ugh, that Spencer is just the most annoying dirtbag ever! Heidi was also noticeably absent from the finale party on MTV, apparently because Spencer wasn't invited and she wouldn't go without him. The two are still living together (I'll pause for the shocked gasps) and Spencer is now running his mouth to the mag, saying that he and Heidi are "<i>going to take over the world. Heidi is the biggest star from that show.</i>" Wake up Spencer! Heidi is a joke and so are you. If that wasn't bad enough, <i>US Weekly</i> is also reporting that Heidi got breast implants on Monday, and that "<i>she did this for herself, and is hoping to keep it as private as possible.</i>" Right. That's why <i>US Weekly</i> found out! And I'm also sure Spencer had <b>no</b> say in it. Seems like Lauren is better off hanging out with Audrina and her recently reunited BFF, the adorable Lo from season 1 "Laguna Beach" fame. Lauren must be excited to finally have some time off from filming now that the season is over, so she can tell her friends what she <i>really</i> thinks of Heidi!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Nov 08 2006 in Hollywood, Ca. It's nothing but single, smooth sailing these days for "The Hills" It-Girl <b>Lauren Conrad</b>, and that's just the way she likes it. After a summer romance with Laguna Beach "bad boy" (notice the quotes) in which she gave up a trip to Paris with Teen Vogue, LC is now saying that she is a "bad dater". Lauren tells <i>People Magazine</i> how she is "<i>a bad dater. I'm the most socially awkward person, like carrying on conversations and stuff. ... I don't want to date anyone right now anyway, so it doesn't really matter.</i>" And if you were as fiesty and cute as LC, you wouldn't wanna be tied down anyway!</P>
<p>Back in November, LC hit up the Playstation 3 Launch Party in Hollywood with "Hills" co-star Heidi Montag looking hot in a <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/plenty-by-tracy-reese/halter-cami-in-indigo/product.html"> navy minidress</a> and <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/aaneta/medium-martina-in-black/product.html"> black bag</a>. Can't wait to see what happens on this season of "The Hills"!</p>

					<p class="sightdesc">Lauren Conrad seen on Aug 25 2006 in Hollywood, Ca. The past is definitely coming back to haunt <b>Lauren Conrad</b> and her relationship with ex Brody Jenner. Back in November, the two dated briefly after Brody split from Nicole Richie and "Laguna Beach"-enemy Kristin Cavallari and LC broke up with Jason, also from the show. Back in October, when asked if he and Lauren were dating, he said "<i>I don't know what you consider dating, but we're seeing each other, we're having a great time with it. She's an amazing girl.</i>" Apparently the two split because they both needed to be single for a while, not for anything scandalous like he cheated on her with Kristin or anything. But now, that season 2 of "The Hills" is airing, the two have a constant reminder of the beginning of their relationship. Hope no sore subjects are brought up!</p>
<p>Back in August, LC was spotted shopping on Melrose in a pair of <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/paper-denim-and-cloth/super-slim-zipper-cigarette-pant-in-olivia/product.html"> dark skinny jeans</a> and a <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/saint-grace/short-sleeve-scoop/product.html"> basic white tee</a> with <a href="http://www.couturecandy.com/nour/minou-in-manner-mania/product.html"> big brown shades</a>. Stay single Lauren, it definitely looks good on ya!</p>
