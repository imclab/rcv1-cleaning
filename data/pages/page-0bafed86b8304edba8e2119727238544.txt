			<p class="auto-style9"><strong>HISTORY OF THE CHEVROLET CAMARO</strong></p>
			<p class="auto-style7">First Generation Camaro (1967 - 1970)</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Just as the first Mustang was based on Ford's 
			compact Falcon, so the first <strong>1967</strong> Camaro was based 
			on Chevy's compact Nova. However, it was based on the upcoming 
			redesigned '68 Nova and therefore more robust than a comparable '67 
			Nova.<br>The basic engineering of the Camaro was a unibody structure 
			from the windshield and firewall back, with a separate steel rail 
			subframe for everything up front. Double A-arms made up the 
			independent front suspension while the solid rear axle was suspended 
			by semi-elliptical leaf springs. As was typical of standard-equipped 
			vehicles at the time, braking was by four drums, the steering was 
			slow and manual, and Chevy's rugged 230-cubic-inch straight six 
			poked out an optimistically rated 140 horsepower while twisting a 
			three-speed manual transmission.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">The base $2,466 '67 Camaro sport coupe was 
			lean and aggressive, as was the convertible. Adding substance to 
			that appearance was done either by picking or combining individual 
			options or trim packages called RS and SS. Buyers could opt for a 
			larger 250-inch version of the six making 155 horsepower, a 
			210-horsepower 327-cubic-inch small-block V8 fed by a two-barrel 
			carb, that same V8 with a four-barrel carb and a higher compression 
			ratio was rated at 275 horsepower, or two versions of the 
			396-cubic-inch big-block V8 making either 325 or 375 horsepower. 
			Those engines could be lashed to a series of wide- or short-ratio 
			three- or four-speed manual transmissions, or one of two automatics: 
			the slushy two-speed Powerglide or outstanding three-speed 
			Turbobydramatic.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">The Rally Sport (RS) appearance package 
			brought deluxe interior trim and hidden headlights with it, and the 
			high-performance Super Sport (SS) package had its own distinct 
			decoration (including a domed hood with simulated vents, &quot;bumble 
			bee&quot; stripes encircling the nose and the iconic SS badges), a 
			heavy-duty suspension and larger D70-series tires on 14-inch wheels. 
			Beyond that, the SS-350 model also offered a new 350-cubic-inch 
			small-block V8 rated at 295 horsepower  Chevy's first 350. The 
			Rally Sport and Super Sport packages could also be ordered together 
			to form the most lavishly equipped Camaro of them all, the RS/SS. 
			And it was an RS/SS convertible powered by a 396 that Chevy provided 
			as pace car for the 1967 Indianapolis 500.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Almost outside the regular Camaro line was 
			the race-oriented Z/28. Introduced in December 1966, the Z/28 was 
			powered by a special high-compression 302-cubic-inch V8 whose 
			displacement was achieved by matching the short-stroke crank of the 
			283-cubic-inch version with the big-bore block of the 327. Rated at 
			290 horsepower and built to rev, the radical power plant was matched 
			to a more aggressive suspension. How did the first Camaro perform?
			<em>Car Life</em> magazine's test of an SS-350 had it completing the 
			quarter-mile in 15.8 seconds at 89 mph while <em>Motor Trend</em> 
			reported that its SS-350 did the same trick in 15.4 seconds at 90 
			mph. Thanks to &quot;Astro Ventilation,&quot; General Motors eliminated the 
			side vent wing windows on the <strong>1968</strong> Camaro and also 
			added federally mandated side marker lights and a revised base 
			grille). Mechanically, the most significant change was the adoption 
			of staggered rear shocks (one in front of the rear axle, one behind) 
			to counteract wheel hop under hard acceleration.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">While the <strong>1969</strong> Camaro's 
			structure and mechanical elements were virtually unchanged from the 
			'68 model, new fenders, door skins, rear quarter-panels, grille and 
			taillights gave the car a wider, lower appearance. A redesigned dash 
			and more comfortable seats made it more livable, too. But it was the 
			staggering array of available performance equipment that marks 1969 
			as the greatest model year for Camaros. On the yawn side, a new 
			low-performance 200-horsepower 307-cubic-inch small-block (a 327 
			crank in a 283 block) supplemented the low-performance 327 and a new 
			255-horsepower 350 replaced the better-performing 327. On the <em>
			yeow </em>side, Chevy produced its second Camaro Indianapolis 500 
			pace car and offered replicas of the white RS/SS convertible with 
			orange stripes and orange houndstooth upholstery to the public (the 
			actual pace car was powered by a 396, but most of the replicas had 
			350s). In addition, two radical Camaros were produced in extremely 
			limited numbers under special Central Office Production Orders 
			(COPO) 9560 and 9561.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">The COPO 9561 was a basic Camaro sport coupe 
			stuffed with 427 cubic inches of all-iron big-block making 425 
			horsepower. Most of the 1,015 COPO 9561s were delivered to 
			Pennsylvania's Yenko Chevrolet for conversion into that dealership's 
			signature Camaro. Even rarer was the COPO 9560 featuring the 
			legendary all-aluminum ZL-1 427 also rated at 425 horsepower. Only 
			69 of the ZL-1s were built, and because of their rarity, tremendous 
			output and relatively low weight, they are today considered the 
			quickest and most valuable Camaros ever built. Sales of the 1969 
			models extended into the winter of 1969 and early 1970; some of 
			these lingering '69s may have been titled as 1970 models, leading to 
			some confusion.&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Second Generation Camaro (1970½ - 1981)</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Though it didn't make it to market until 
			February of 1970, the second-generation <strong>1970½</strong> 
			Camaro would be in production 12 years. The second-generation 
			Camaro's styling was inspired by Ferrari and was also bigger, 
			heavier and no longer available as a convertible. And as the 1970s 
			progressed, it would grow less powerful, succumbing to the pressures 
			of tightening emissions regulations and a fuel crisis. Still based 
			on the Nova, the new Camaro was engineered much like its predecessor 
			in that it still used a unibody structure with a front subframe, 
			leaf springs in the back and A-arms up front for suspension. Those 
			A-arms were freshly designed and the steering gear moved from the 
			back to the front of the front axle, but otherwise the basic 
			mechanical pieces were familiar.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Also familiar were most of the engines. The 
			155-horsepower 250-cubic-inch six was now the Camaro's base engine, 
			followed by the who-cares 200-horsepower 307, the lowliest of V8 
			offerings. A 250-horsepower two-barrel 350 effectively replaced the 
			327. Order the SS package and the 350 earned a four-barrel carb and 
			additional compression to reach 300 horsepower. Moreover, SS buyers 
			could pay even more and get a 350- or 375-horsepower 396 big-block 
			V8. As before, the Camaro was offered with Rally Sport or Super 
			Sport equipment or both. The Rally Sport package featured a unique 
			front-end appearance with a split front bumper and a center grille 
			cavity encircled in rubber. The SS again had heavier-duty suspension 
			and the &quot;SS&quot; logos.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">The star 1970½ Camaro was again the Z/28, now 
			powered by a 360-horsepower high-compression &quot;LT-1&quot; 350. Unlike the 
			high-revving 302 used in the first Z/28s, the LT-1 was easy-going in 
			everyday traffic, still revved with enthusiasm and was now available 
			with an automatic transmission. <em>Car and Driver</em>'s test had 
			the '70½ Z/28 ripping to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds and running through 
			the quarter-mile in 14.2 seconds at a full 100.3 mph, though the 
			drivers still found it lacking in bottom-end power. But the glory 
			days of the LT-1 would last just that one year. With emissions 
			regulations growing tougher, GM dropped compression ratios across 
			the board for <strong>1971</strong> and also adopted &quot;net&quot; alongside 
			&quot;gross&quot; power ratings for its engines (by '72, all engines were only 
			net rated). For the 250-cubic inch inline six, the power rating 
			dropped from 155-gross to 110-net horsepower. For the LT-1, the drop 
			was a 30-horsepower plunge down to a 330 horsepower gross and 275 
			horsepower net. Otherwise, the '71 barely changed from the '70½ 
			model; high-back bucket seats were new, and the rear spoiler on 
			Z/28s was now a larger three-piece unit.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">The <strong>1972</strong> Camaro changed 
			mostly in the engine bay where the horsepower devastation continued. 
			The LT-1 could now only poke out 255 horsepower (net) and the most 
			robust big-block (still called a 396, but in reality a 402) was 
			making just 240 net horsepower.<br>In <strong>1973</strong> the 
			bumpers were slightly revised and the horsepower drain continued 
			with the base six now making an utterly lame 100 net horsepower and 
			the L82 only 245. The big-block was off the option sheet altogether. 
			In place of the Super Sport was the &quot;Type-LT&quot; Camaro, which bundled 
			a slew of luxury options into one cohesive package. To meet new 
			bumper regulations, the <strong>1974</strong> Camaro was redesigned 
			with thick aluminum bumpers front and rear. The one-and-only grille 
			(the Rally Sport option vanished) was now shovel-shaped and the rear 
			taillights wrapped into the fenders. But there were no changes to 
			the available engines and trim levels.<br>With unbelievable 
			shortsightedness, Chevy killed the Z/28 and pared the engine 
			selection down to just three catalyst-equipped lumps for <strong>
			1975</strong>  the 250-cubic-inch six now rated at 105 horsepower, 
			a two-barrel 350 V8 making a pathetic 145 horsepower and a 
			four-barrel version of the same engine rated at a meager 155 
			horsepower. Distinguishing the '75 from '74 was a new rear window 
			that wrapped down into the roof sail panels. Also new for '75 was a 
			&quot;Rally Sport&quot; package that consisted of two-tone paint and some tape 
			stripes.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">For no apparent reason, the '75 Camaro sold 
			well, so there were few changes to the <strong>1976</strong> model. 
			An aluminum panel between the taillights was now used on the 
			Type-LT, power brakes were finally standard and cruise control was a 
			new option. The two-barrel 350 was killed in favor of an 
			even-crummier two-barrel 305 producing 140 horsepower while the 
			four-barrel 350 now whacked out a still-inexcusable 165 horsepower. 
			When the <strong>1977</strong> Camaro appeared, there were again few 
			changes (intermittent wipers anyone?), but in the middle of the 
			year, the Z/28 returned as a separate model whose concentration was 
			now on handling and appearance. And the new Z/28 did handle well, 
			even if it only had 170 horsepower aboard from the same 350 
			four-barrel V8 offered in other Camaros (up 5 horsepower from '76). 
			The '77 Camaro was thoroughly lackluster, but with Ford foisting the 
			hideous Mustang II upon America, for the first time, more Camaros 
			(198,755) were sold than Mustangs (161,654). Daring to mess (however 
			lightly) with success, Chevrolet equipped the <strong>1978</strong> 
			Camaro with a new nose that put the big bumpers under soft plastic. 
			Five models were now offered (sport coupe, Rally Sport, Type-LT, 
			Type-LT Rally Sport and Z/28), and translucent T-tops were a new 
			option. The Z/28's full-disco body package (with front fender vents 
			and a fake hood scoop) was supported in '78 with a revised version 
			of the 350 V8 now rated at a better-but-still-weak 185 horsepower.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Though almost a carryover from '78, the
			<strong>1979</strong> Camaro would prove the most popular one yet. 
			The Type-LT vanished in favor of a new trim level called Berlinetta, 
			but the engines were all unchanged, even though power ratings were 
			rattled a bit in contending with emissions requirements (Z/28 output 
			dropped to 175 horsepower for 49-state cars). The most substantial 
			change to the '79 Camaro was a new instrument panel with more 
			contemporary instrumentation and better control placement. Chevy 
			sold a stunning 282,571 Camaros during the 1979 model year  a 
			number it would never top. Looking to improve fuel economy, Chevy 
			mangled the Camaro's engine lineup for <strong>1980</strong> while 
			leaving the rest of the car pretty much alone. A new 115-horsepower 
			229-cubic-inch V6 (basically a small-block V8 with a pair of 
			cylinders hacked off)  or, in California, a 110-horsepower 
			231-cubic-inch V6 replaced the ancient inline six, and a new 
			267-cubic-inch two-barrel version of the small-block V8 debuted, 
			rated at a laughable 120 horsepower. On the positive side, output of 
			the Z/28's 350 grew to 190 horsepower, except in California where 
			buyers got a 155-horsepower 305-cubic-inch V8 mated to a mandatory 
			three-speed automatic. Caught in a fuel crisis, Camaro sales 
			nose-dived to 152,005 during the 1980 model year.<br>The antiquated 
			platform of the second-generation Camaro had run its course by the
			<strong>1981</strong> model year. With a new engine control computer 
			aboard, all engines were now certified for all 50 states, but output 
			on the Z/28's 350 dropped to 175 horsepower. The Rally Sport died 
			(again) and the '81 Camaro lineup consisted of three well-defined 
			models: base sport coupe, Berlinetta and Z/28. Those three model 
			names would survive to see 1982, but not much else. </p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Third Generation Camaro (1982 - 1992)</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Third-generation Camaros were the first built 
			without front subframes or leaf-spring rear suspensions. Now the 
			front end was held up with a modified MacPherson strut system, and 
			the hind end relied on a long torque arm and coil springs. These 
			were also the first Camaros with factory fuel injection, four-speed 
			automatic transmissions, five-speed manual transmissions, 
			four-cylinder engines, 16-inch wheels and hatchback bodies. In 
			January 1982, the Camaro was, for the first time since 1967, truly 
			all-new and slightly smaller.<br>But the <strong>1982</strong> 
			engine selection was hardly scintillating. Base sport coupes started 
			with a 90-horsepower version of GM's lethargic 2.5-liter &quot;Iron Duke&quot; 
			four and could be optioned up to a 112-horse 2.8-liter V6 (base 
			engine in the Berlinetta) or a four-barrel carbureted 5.0-liter 
			(305-cubic-inch) small-block V8 rated at 145 horsepower. That V8 was 
			the Z28's base powerplant; buyers could opt for a Z28 &quot;Cross-Fire 
			Injection&quot; (throttle body-injected) version producing 165 
			horsepower. The carbureted V8 could be had with either a three-speed 
			automatic or four-speed manual, but the injected engine was 
			automatic only.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">A Camaro paced the Indianapolis 500 again in 
			1982, and the silver and blue replicas of that car are probably the 
			most attractive of the '82s. However, the T-top Z28 that actually 
			paced the Memorial Day classic that year used a highly modified 350 
			(5.7-liter) V8 for motivation that wasn't available to the general 
			public. Kind of sad, really. The three-tier Camaro lineup continued 
			into <strong>1983</strong> with minimal visual differences. However 
			the Z28 got a nice power bump with the introduction of the &quot;L69&quot; 
			engine option. With a Corvette-spec camshaft, revised exhaust and a 
			healthy four-barrel carb, the 5.0-liter L69 &quot;H.O.&quot; V8 was rated at 
			190 horsepower and could be backed by a new five-speed manual 
			transmission.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">For <strong>1984</strong>, availability of 
			the L69 improved on Z28s (the junky Cross-Fire engine died) and the 
			four-speed &quot;700R4&quot; automatic was adopted by most Camaro models. 
			Because anything digital was, of course, good, the Berlinetta 
			sprouted a funkadelic digital instrument panel and overhead console 
			this year, as well. The instrumentation was probably more 
			entertaining than the V6 that powered most Berlinettas. The great 
			leap forward in third-generation Camaro performance came with the 
			introduction of the <strong>1985</strong> IROC-Z, named after the 
			International Race of Champions, which was contested with Camaros. 
			The IROC featured big 16-inch five-spoke wheels and unique graphics. 
			Carbureted versions of the 5.0-liter small-block V8 were still 
			available, but the big improvement came with the fitment of Tuned 
			Port Injection (TPI) to that engine to produce a flexible 215 
			horsepower. Sadly, the TPI engine could only be had with the 
			four-speed automatic (in either the IROC or the regular Z28).</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Beneath the Z28, the sport coupe and 
			Berlinetta blustered through <strong>1985</strong> unchanged, except 
			for a new fuel-injected version of the 2.8-liter V6 that now pushed 
			out 135 horsepower. The <strong>1986</strong> Camaros were easy to 
			spot because of the goofy blister fitted atop their rear hatches to 
			accommodate the federally mandated center high-mounted stop light 
			(CHMSL). Beyond that, there was a new exhaust system for non-Z28 
			cars and a new basecoat/clearcoat two-stage paint system. Big 
			engines returned to the Camaro for <strong>1987</strong> with the 
			good old 350 (5.7-liter) V8 making its way into IROC-Zs as an 
			option. Capped with the TPI system, the 5.7 was rated at a full 225 
			horsepower  the highest horsepower in a Camaro in 13 years and with 
			vastly better drivability. While the TPI 5.7 came only with the 
			four-speed automatic, the TPI 5.0 liter was finally available with 
			the five-speed manual.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Equally good news was the comeback of the 
			Camaro convertible  the first Camaro convertible since 1969  and 
			the consignment of the four-cylinder engine to a well-deserved 
			eternity in the junkyard. The high-output carbureted 5.0-liter V8 
			also disappeared, and a new 165 horsepower carbureted 5.0-liter V8 
			became the standard Z28 engine. Also gone from the '87 Camaro line 
			were the Berlinetta (replaced with an &quot;LT&quot; option package), and, on 
			any Camaro with a rear spoiler, that ugly CHMSL housing on the rear 
			glass. The CHMSL was instead built into the spoiler and Chevy would 
			simplify its own production for 1988 by making the rear spoiler 
			standard on all Camaros. So that brake light blister was gone 
			entirely from the <strong>1988</strong> Camaro, but so was the Z28. 
			Since Chevy had firmly established the IROC name, all 
			high-performance '88 Camaros became IROCs. Base '88 Camaros, 
			meanwhile, inherited the elegant 15-inch five-spoke wheels from the 
			Z28, as well as the Z28's lower body skirting. Also, the Z28's 
			5.0-liter V8 was now optional on the sport coupe; it gained a 
			throttle body fuel-injection system to make 170 horsepower. The 
			rarest and most intriguing '88 Camaro was the 1LE road racing 
			package optional on the IROCs with both the 5.0- and 5.7-liter TPI 
			engines. Featuring oversize disc brakes, an aluminum driveshaft and 
			a well-tweaked suspension, the 1LE was built to win showroom stock 
			road races.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Proving that no name is forever dead in the 
			world of Camaros, the old &quot;RS&quot; (but not Rally Sport) designation 
			returned for the <strong>1989</strong> model year. Looking much like 
			an '85 Z28, the RS was a basically a trim package atop the base 
			sport coupe and was powered by either the V6 or a 
			throttle-body-injected 5.0-liter V8. Although the 5.7 TPI V8 now 
			boasted 240 horsepower, about the only way to tell '89 IROCs from 
			previous years is to look at the ignition key and see if has the 
			&quot;Pass-Key&quot; theft deterrent resistor embedded in it. The IROC 
			breathed its last breath during the short <strong>1990</strong> 
			model year, as Dodge picked up sponsorship of the International Race 
			of Champions. The big changes that year were the growth of the base 
			V6 from 2.8 to 3.1 liters, with a bump in output from 135 to 140 
			horsepower and the fitment of driver-side airbags to all models.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Chevy jump-started the <strong>1991</strong> 
			model year by re-introducing the Z28 in the spring of 1990. Sure, 
			the '91 Z28 got a tall rear wing, new lower body cladding, new phony 
			hood scoops and new five-spoke wheels, but it was otherwise still an 
			IROC and now the top engine was a 245 horsepower 5.7-liter TPI V8. 
			All other '91 Camaros were pretty much '90 Camaros with revised 
			ground effects that featured fake air inlets. Law enforcement got 
			its own Camaro in 1991 with the introduction of the Camaro B4C 
			pursuit vehicle. Basically, a B4C was a Z28 that was badged as an RS 
			and equipped with most of the good stuff developed for the 1LE race 
			package. Very few B4Cs were ever produced. With an all-new Camaro 
			coming for 1993, the <strong>1992</strong> model was barely changed 
			from '91. The big change was that they all sported a &quot;25th 
			Anniversary&quot; badge on their instrument panels. Further, a $175 
			&quot;Heritage Package&quot; of stripes was offered for any '92 Camaro. It was 
			time for another new Camaro. </p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Fourth Generation Camaro (1993 - 2002)</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">While the <strong>1993</strong> 
			fourth-generation Camaro was very much new, it was shy of all-new; 
			much of the floor stamping and all of the rear suspension was shared 
			with the third-generation car. But with plastic front fenders, a new 
			short-arm/long-arm front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and a 
			sleek new profile, the '93 was new enough. For '93, the Camaro 
			lineup was pared to two models: base sport coupe powered by a 
			160-horsepower 3.4-liter version of GM's V6 and the Z28 with the 
			Corvette's 5.7-liter LT1 small-block V8 underrated at 275 
			horsepower. Once again, the convertible was gone. The black-roofed 
			(no matter what the body color) '93 Z28 was a stunner. The LT1 was 
			easily the most powerful small-block installed in the Camaro since 
			its namesake, the 1970 LT-1, and, considering the move from gross to 
			net power ratings, probably even more powerful than that legend. 
			Behind it was either a four-speed automatic or six-speed manual 
			transmission and 16-inch wheels and tires; and four-wheel antilock 
			disc brakes were standard. With Z28 prices starting under $17,000, 
			the value was just amazing. The most desirable '93? Probably the 
			black Z28 replicas of that year's Indy 500 pace car. These replicas 
			were identical to the actual pace car which, in stark contrast to 
			the '82, led the race with no mechanical changes.<br>As expected, 
			the convertible Camaro returned with the <strong>1994</strong> model 
			year. Designed and built by GM at the St. Therese, Quebec, plant 
			where all F-cars were assembled, the '94 ragtop's chassis was 
			significantly stiffer than the previous convertible's. Otherwise 
			it's almost impossible to tell a '94 coupe from a '93 unless one 
			opens up the automatic transmission and finds that it is the 
			electronically controlled version of the 4L60.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">While the <strong>1995</strong> Z28 received 
			only minor changes (all-season tires and traction control were now 
			available), the base Camaro added GM's &quot;3800&quot; 200-horsepower 
			3.8-liter V6 as an option. The 3800 was both significantly more 
			powerful and refined than the 3400, and by 1996 would become the 
			only V6 in Camaros. With the adoption of the 3800 as standard power, 
			the least powerful <strong>1996</strong> Camaro still had more power 
			than the most powerful 1984 Camaro. Somewhat in celebration, the RS 
			name reappeared on the V6 coupe as a spoiler and ground effects 
			package. Meanwhile on the Z28 side, the V8's output jumped to 285 
			horsepower and SLP Engineering brought back the SS name by adding 
			engine tweaks and 17-inch five-spoke wheels wrapped with P245/40ZR17 
			BF Goodrich Comp T/A tires. The SS, with its 305 horsepower rating 
			was the first factory Camaro to break the 300 horsepower barrier 
			since 1971, and the first of any year using net ratings.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">To celebrate the Camaro's 30th anniversary, 
			Chevy introduced a specially optioned white Z28 with orange stripes 
			and orange houndstooth upholstery (evocative of the '69 Camaro pace 
			car) for <strong>1997</strong>. Otherwise, there were new 
			&quot;tri-color&quot; tail lamps for all models, and SLP produced an extremely 
			limited run (106 cars) of 330-horsepower Corvette LT4 5.7-liter 
			V8-powered Camaro Z28 SS models.<br>The fourth-generation Camaro's 
			first (and only) extensive visual update came for <strong>1998</strong> 
			with a new front fascia design. But the real news lay behind that 
			face where the C5 Corvette's new-age all-aluminum small-block LS-1 
			V8 took up residence in the Z28. The 5.7-liter LS-1 was the first 
			all-aluminum engine offered in a Camaro since the '69 ZL-1 and 
			carried a thrilling 305-horsepower rating (base Camaros kept the 
			200-horsepower 3800 V6). GM took over production of the SS itself 
			this year, as well, with the ram-air induction system boosting the 
			LS-1 to 320 horsepower.</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Except for electronic throttle control on V6 
			models, a new oil life monitor and a Torsen limited-slip 
			differential, the <strong>1999</strong> Camaros were 
			indistinguishable from the '98 models. In turn, the <strong>2000</strong> 
			Camaros were pretty much the same as the '99s, except for radio 
			controls integrated into the steering wheel, body-color side view 
			mirrors, some new interior fabrics and an optional 12-disc CD 
			changer.<br>By <strong>2001</strong>, it was obvious that the 
			Camaro's days were numbered, and the only changes to the car were 
			restyled 16-inch wheels, a new paint color and the unchanged LS-1's 
			output rating to 310 horsepower in the Z28. Grimly, the Camaro 
			soldiered on into <strong>2002</strong>. For the Camaro's last year 
			in production, changes were, understandably, minimal. Z28s got a new 
			power steering cooler, the sound systems were revised and V6 
			convertibles got the automatic transmission standard, but that's 
			about it. Chevrolet did celebrate the car's 35th year, however, with 
			a special graphics package for the Z28 SS coupe and convertible. The 
			flamboyant stripes and logos of the 35th Anniversary package were 
			attractive in their own idiomatic way, but it was hardly the 
			glorious send-off for which Camaro enthusiasts had hoped. </p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Fifth Generation Camaro (2010 - Present)</p>
			<p class="auto-style7">After eight years of flying the Chevy flag at 
			half-mast, Camaro enthusiasts had their prayers answered when 
			Chevrolet brought back its road burner for <strong>2010</strong>. 
			Initially available only as a coupe in base LS, midlevel LT and 
			V8-powered SS models, this is without a doubt the best Camaro to 
			date. The retro styling borrows shamelessly from the 1969 Camaro, 
			down to the cowl-induction-style hood, Coke bottle profile, 
			cross-hatch grille and rear-quarter gills. Yet it's not a complete 
			knock-off, as the 2010 has a huskier stance and is noticeably 
			thicker in the rear haunches. The cockpit is mostly modern, with a 
			few old-school touches thrown in such as a quartet of gauges located 
			down low in front of the gear shifter. The latter isn't exactly an 
			ergonomic success, but they pay homage to the optional setup of the 
			late '60s. The available RS package (essentially an appearance 
			package) adds bigger (20-inch) wheels, a rear spoiler, HID 
			headlights and smoked taillights. </p>
			<p class="auto-style7">Unlike before, getting a V6 Camaro doesn't 
			mean &quot;plenty of show but not so much go.&quot; The LS and LT come packing 
			304 hp via a direct-injected, 3.6-liter V6. It also has a six-speed 
			manual transmission (six-speed automatic optional), disc brakes all 
			around, an independent rear suspension (a Camaro first) and 18-inch 
			wheels. At a base price of around $23,000, the entry-level Camaro 
			offers a heavy dose of performance that's light on the wallet. With 
			0-to-60 and quarter-mile times of 6.0 and 14.2 seconds, 
			respectively, these are seriously rapid cars.&nbsp; The big-dog SS 
			has a 6.2-liter V8 with either 426 hp (with six-speed manual) or 400 
			hp (with six-speed automatic) as well as meatier Brembo disc brakes. 
			With the ability to leap to 60 mph in 5 seconds and tear down the 
			quarter-mile in 13 seconds flat, the SS will show its taillights to 
			virtually any Camaro that came before, perhaps even the super rare 
			ZL-1 of 1969. And in terms of unraveling a twisty road, the latest 
			Camaro has no peer with its elders, thanks to a finely balanced and 
			tuned chassis, the aforementioned independent rear end and quick, 
			communicative steering. </p>
