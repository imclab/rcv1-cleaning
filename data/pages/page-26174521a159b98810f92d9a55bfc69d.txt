The Continental Club had a lot of potential, but it only lasted a year.

A few years ago, the Old Curtis St. Bar had terrible sound and a nearly sub-dive vibe. But it's steadily become a better place to play. There is now a small stage &mdash; outfitted with gear from the 15th St. Tavern &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and a rudimentary sound system that provides for decent vocals and kick-drum sound.

The Gypsy House, situated on the southeast corner of 13th Avenue and Marion Street, isn't just the place to get some of the best chai in town and relax in a calming bohemian setting.

Band reunions that take place more than a decade down the line are generally sad affairs that tend to accentuate the passage of time rather than causing it to stand still. But even though the original members of the Fluid &mdash; John Robinson, Garrett Shavlik, James Clower, Rick Kulwicki and Matt Bischoff &mdash; hadn't played together since the early '90s,&hellip; <a class='more' href='/bestof/2009/award/best-local-concert-1053530/'>More >></a>

It's hard to imagine a more perfect setting for the return of Rage Against the Machine than Denver during the Democratic National Convention.

A Fluid reunion show seemed unlikely fifteen years after the band broke up, but fortunately for us, it happened. Even more unlikely was the reunion of one of the true punk-rock legends of the Colorado scene: the Frantix.

Everything Absent or Distorted's strong debut, The Soft Civil War, should have been difficult to improve upon &mdash; a sophomore slump would have been acceptable, even expected, from Denver's resident bombastic pop big band.

Colorado rapper A.V.I.U.S., producer Es-Nine and DJ Cysko Rokwel each had their own thing going on before they came together as 3 the Hardway: Cysko Rokwel was taking out DJs nationwide in the DMC Championships; Es-Nine was producing for local and national artists; and A.V.I.U.S. had just dropped his solid debut album, Patience.

For the fans who've played out the Pirate Signal's EP from 2006 like it was the only CD they owned, the duo's mixtape Of Gods and Gangsters, Vol. 1 was a breath of fresh air. The tape, entirely mixed by DJ A-What!, features Yonnas spittin' over original beats as well as beats used by M.I.A., 50 Cent and Kanye West,&hellip; <a class='more' href='/bestof/2009/award/best-hip-hop-mixtape-1053540/'>More >></a>

These days, CDs are seen as outmoded technology &mdash; a point made in a witty way by EP01, whose sleeve duplicates the design of an '80s-era floppy disc. Unlike a floppy, however, the CD inside will work in a modern computer drive.

Many of today's most extreme Denver bands were influenced by Bum Kon without even knowing it &mdash; and thanks to Drunken Sex Sucks, they can now fill in the gaps of their musical education. Only five of the 25 cuts here received a proper release, with the remainder appearing on an album for the first time.

The re-release of the VSS's final album, Nervous Circuits, hardly needs recommendation.

Young Coyotes has been around for less than a year. In that short time, however, the act has released two EPs, embarked on several cross-country tours, recorded a Daytrotter session, been hailed on numerous blogs and attracted a high-powered manager in Blee Music's Brian Swartz (Rose Hill Drive).

In the spirit of such acts as Dashboard Confessional, City and Colour and Bon Iver, Danielle Anderson opted to go with the clumsy Danielle Ate the Sandwich rather than her given name.

Being dubbed a "supergroup" can be a bit of a curse, but when your band includes members of local luminaries such as Bright Channel, Space Team Electra, Moccasin and Monofog, that term seems somewhat justified. But it would be meaningless if the resulting music was one iota less powerful, uplifting or sonically inventive than the music of Moonspeed.

It's hard to say if this is really a band or a performance-art group or both &mdash; or if it even matters to make such distinctions. It seems laughable to say that the act has developed since its debut early last year, but it has, adding various members along the way.

Once upon a time, an Achille Lauro show was a rare and remarkable event.
