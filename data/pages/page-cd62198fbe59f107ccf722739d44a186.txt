      <p class="highlightred">It is not advisable to accept a personal cheque as payment when selling your car. There are a number of reports people losing their car and receiving no money as a result of the cheque bouncing.</p>
      <p>Buying or selling your precious auto is always a fun process, and you'll
        enjoy it in Dubai as much as anywhere. Take
        a few posh cars for a test drive - you'll find second hand dealers a
        lot more willing to throw you the
        keys to a Mercedes or BMW than in many other countries. New car dealers
        are usually pretty good too as long as you look halfway sensible.</p>
      <p>What follows are details of where to buy, how to buy, how to sell,
          how to register, etc. Remember that cars seem to age more quickly in
          the arid
          climate in Dubai and look old sooner than you might expect elsewhere.
          Maintenance tends to be fairly casual too, FSH (Full Service History)
          usually means the car had a service every now and then, and there's
        no record of it. At the end are a few suggestions to consider (it's not
          advice but just a couple of ideas to get you started on your car shopping
          adventure),
          and        a few tips on what to look out for when shopping for a second
          hand car (it's not comprehensive, and it's no replacement for a proper
          test/check up by someone who knows what they're doing).</p>
      <h4>Selling a New Car</h4>
      <p>You may wonder about the heading here but it's not completely unheard
          of for private individuals to sell a new car - quite a few are given
          away as raffle prizes. You'll be offered a ridiculously low sum of
          money from a second hand dealer (or even the original dealer), and
          will probably do much better if you sell it through other means. A
          difficulty is that you can't test drive it unless you register it -
          which makes it second hand then.</p>
      <h4>Buying a New Car</h4>
      <p>A choice many new arrivals to Dubai shy away from but there are a
          number of things going for this option.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New cars are relatively cheap compared to many countries (probably
          not USA, NZ, or countries in Europe where cars are cheaper - France?
          Germany?)</li>
        <li>A bank loan is often cheaper than you first expect and usually, most
          working expats have more disposable cash compared to previous country
          of residence.</li>
        <li>New cars have some protection with the warranty.</li>
        <li>Some come with service agreements or contracts included (eg 3 years
          or 100,000 km worth of servicing, not usually transferable when selling
          car).</li>
        <li>You don't have to wonder if it's been looked after properly or not.</li>
        <li>Usually you can choose your preferred color.</li>
        <li>Often there'll be a good promotion on something close to what you
          want - especially unsold one year old models just before the new ones
          come out.</li>
        <li>The downside is the loan (if you've opted for that) and the depreciation
          (insane, like anywhere).</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>New Car Dealers<a name="dealers"></a></h5>
      <p>There's usually only  one dealer per car manufacturer due to
        the Sole Agency law in the UAE. So the lack of competition does mean
        you're
        stuck
        with
        that dealer for servicing if you want your warranty to remain valid.
        This applies to 2nd hand cars also if they're still under warranty. That
        law applies on a per emirate basis so you will find some automobile manufacturers
        with a different agent in different emirates. Some of the bigger car
        dealers in Dubai are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AGMC - BMW</li>
        <li>Al Futtaim - Lexus, Toyota</li>
        <li>Al Ghandi Auto - Chevrolet (Dubai &amp; Ras Al Khaimah, from January
        	2008, previously was Al Yousef Motors), GMC </li>
        <li>Al Habtoor Motors - Aston Martin, Bentley, Mitsubishi</li>
        <li>Al Majid Motors - Hyundai, Kia</li>
        <li>Al Nabooda Automobiles - Audi, Porsche, Volkswagen</li>
        <li>Al Rostamani Group - Citroen/Citro&euml;n  (31 May 2010 agreement signed for all emirates) </li>
        <li>Al Tayer Motors - Ferrari, Ford, Jaguar, Landrover, Lincoln, Mercury</li>
        <li>Al Yousuf Motors - Chevrolet (changed to Al Ghandi in Dubai &amp; RAK
        	from Jan 2008), Daihatsu, Daewoo</li>
        <li>Arabian Automobiles (Al Rostamani) - Nissan</li>
        <li>Galadari - Mazda (used to have Ford also but Ford paid them a few
          million dollars to get out of the agency agreement in about 2001 or
          2002).</li>
        <li>Gargash - Alfa Romeo, Mercedes, Saab</li>
        <li>Liberty Automobiles - Cadillac, Chevrolet, Hummer, Opel</li>
        <li>Trading Enterprises - Chrysler, Dodge, Honda, Jeep, Volvo</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's possible to buy grey imports - new cars from second hand dealers
        at cheaper than new prices. Usually come from other Middle Eastern countries,
        sometimes further afield. Often advertised as &quot;unwanted prizes&quot;.
        The difference is the grey import &quot;unwanted prizes&quot; will have
        warranty problems
        with
        the UAE agent, the real &quot;unwanted prizes&quot; won't.</p>
      <h5>Bank Loans for cars and automobiles<a name="car_loans"></a></h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Most/all banks have some sort of car loan arrangement, easily set
          up if you have a regular salary and a residence visa.</li>
        <li>A car loan means the car is owned by the bank - you can't sell it
          until paid off and get clearance letter from bank.</li>
        <li>A personal loan means the car is owned by you. Interest rate is higher
          than for a car loan.</li>
        <li>Normally banks will want three to six months bank statements, passport
          with resident visa, and salary certificate or letter from your company
          addresses to the bank. If you're getting a car loan then driving license
          also.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Buying a second hand car or used car</h4>
      <p>It's impossible to find one in Dubai now - they're all &quot;pre-owned&quot; instead.
        Makes them sound better than new right?</p>
      <p>One thing (of many) to bear in mind is whether or not a car is built
        to &quot;Middle East or Gulf specifications&quot;. A number of older
        cars have arrived in Dubai from other countries (used Mercedes from
        Europe for example) and have different specifications to new cars supplied
        to Gulf dealers. The main
        concern
        is
        the air conditioning and engine cooling system. Avoid if it's not Gulf
        specification, or at least find out how much it will cost you to upgrade
        it. This is less of a worry with newer cars. Keep reading for more useful
        tips...</p>
      <p class="highlightred">Warning: Do not accept personal cheques as payment for selling your second hand car. There are a number of cases reported where the cheque has bounced and the cheque-writer could not be traced. For example ... </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gulf News 26 August 2010: A couple agreed to sell their 2007 Mercedes for AED 125,000 in August 2010. The purchaser met the couple at the Dubai Traffic Department to transfer registration, and then gave them a personal cheque which subsequently bounced. The couple were quoted saying that &quot;<em>He asked us to sit down and would not allow us to do anything as he went about getting the car passed, doing the Arabic paperwork for the car transfer and getting an export number plate,</em>&quot; The report also said 


        <em>They filed a complaint with the Bur Dubai Police Station who told them that the Emirati had nine similar cases against him.</em></li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Magazines</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>There are a couple of <a href="http://www.dubaifaqs.com/magazines-in-dubai.php">UAE car magazines</a> that have classifieds - Wheels
            (free, weekly) and Auto Trader (weekly, 5 dhs, sold at service stations).</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Auctions</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="al-aweer-used-car-complex-dubai.php">Al Awir used car market
              in Rashidiya</a> has car auctions a couple of
            times a week run by Golden Bell Auctions - www.goldenbellauctions.com. Lists prices paid at previous auctions so good to look through and
            get an idea of car values. Good luck.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Supermarket notice boards</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>It's somewhat quaint to arrive in Dubai and look for cars on a supermarket
          noticeboard but it's a popular way to buy and sell used cars.</li>
        <li><a href="spinneys.php">Spinneys</a> and Choitrams (or Choithrams) seem to be the best choices. Take the same
            precautions as you would anywhere when shopping privately for a used
            car.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Newspapers - classified advertisements</h5>
      <p>See next section for links to newspaper classifieds online. See also
      	<a href="newspapers-in-dubai.php">Dubai newspapers</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>7 Days - limited</li>
        <li>Emirates Today - replaced by Emirates Business 24-7, limited </li>
        <li>Gulf News - has the largest selection and is probably your
          best choice.</li>
        <li>Khaleej Times - some.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Online websites for car sales</h5>
      <p>Note these are listed for reference, that does not mean they are recommendations
        (unless comment says so).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>www.autodealer.ae - claim to be the largest market place for cars, 4wds (4x4s), and bikes. Maybe. Many entries are often repeated.</li>
        <li>www.automalluae.com - Al Futtaim automall website, or not? Information received November 2011 was that it was not Al Futtaim Automall website but the About Us page says &quot;<em>Al-Futtaim Automall is the Used Car Division of the Al-Futtaim Group ...</em>&quot; We're confused.</li>
        <li>www.autosouk.com - good list on home page of cars for sale/wanted.</li>
        <li>www.autotraderuae.com - online version of magazine of the same name. Clumsy navigation to for sale ads (14 May 2008).</li>
        <li>www.cartrader24.com</li>
        <li>dubai.craigslist.org - just started in the UAE in 2006, very popular overseas.</li>
        <li>www.dubaiautozone.com - network error (14 May 2008)</li>
        <li>www.dubizzle.com - popular online classified ads website</li>
        <li>www.gnads4u.com - Gulf News dedicated classified ads site, not an online reproductive organ outlet</li>
        <li>www.khaleejtimes.com - Khaleej Times classified ads (in alphabetical order)</li>
        <li>www.starauto.com - slow loading</li>
        <li>motors.souq.com - auto section of souq.com </li>
        <li>www.uaemall.com - general auction site with vehicle section. Slow to load (14 May 2008).</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Al Awir Used Car Market (or Al Aweer) - Dubai Municipality Used Cars
        Showroom Complex<a name="alaweer"></a></h5>
      <p><a href="al-aweer-used-car-complex-dubai.php">Al Awir Used Car Market</a>, Ras Al Khor Industrial Area - a great place
        to look around and see everything from your most feared POS jalopy to
        exotic
        carriages
        you
        thought only existed in Jeremy Clarkson's imagination. But take a good
        dose of salt with everything you hear and Caveat Emptor should be painted
        on the windshield of every car there. Undoubtedly there are some good
        cars available but how are you going to recognise them from the questionable
        imports, the ones that have been clocked, the insurance write-offs welded
        together again, and so on? The market has a poor reputation and prices
        don't seem particularly cheap compared to other used car sources. Except
        for
      perhaps the auctioned cars.</p>
      <p>The complex has over 100 dealers, a car registration department, insurance
        companies, and a branch of the Middle East Bank so you don't even need
        your own money.</p>
      <p>Opening hours are 7:30 am to 2:00 pm and 
        4:30 pm to 11:00 pm Saturday to Wednesday, maybe half day only on Thursday,
        possibly Fri afternoons for dealers. This could change after 01 Sep 2006
      when government sector changes weekend for Thu/Fri to Fri/Sat.</p>

      <h5>Other used car dealers in Dubai</h5>
      <p>Is there any country in the world where used car dealers don't have
        a bad reputation? The answer is not Dubai or
        the UAE. And you have less comeback if there's a problem than you do
        in countries
        which
        have
        some degree of  consumer protection (assume none
        in the UAE). Look at every car you buy on an &quot;as is, where is&quot; basis.
        The only exception being ones that still have a manufacturer's warranty.
        There
        are second hand car warranties sold by Gulf Warranties which may give
        you some piece of mind but there's a long list of exceptions in what
        they cover, and check the fine print for servicing locations and frequency.</p>
      <p>If you have an accident and it's attributable to a defect that the dealer
        should have known about and had rectified, the police may get involved.
        But that's a bit late if you're laid up in hospital as a result. You'd
        have a very difficult time getting a successful outcome anyway.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4x4 Motors, near Dubai Airport - well known, large, they sell a lot
          of cars. Everyone seems to have a story about themselves or someone
          they know getting ripped off by 4x4. Which probably makes it about
        the same as a used car dealer anywhere else in the world.</li>
        <li>Auto Plus, Sheikh Zayed Road tel +971-4-3395400, Al Wahda St (Sharjah)
          tel +971-6-5321122, www.autoplusdubai.com.</li>
        <li>House Motors, Sheikh Zayed Road - seems to focus more on luxury cars
          (and the customers they think belong in them).</li>
        <li>House of Cars - similar to 4x4.</li>
        <li>Jumeirah Motors</li>
        <li>Off Road Motors - similar to 4x4.</li>
        <li>Western Autos - unknown opinion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Car care and maintenance</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Oil changes can be done quickly and cheaply while you wait
          at the many oil change places connected to petrol stations. Just check
          what your warranty obligations are, and make sure you get synthetic
          oil if that's what your car normally uses. Synthetic
          oil is expensive but regarded as better for your car although there's
          not much point in making a change from non-synthetic oil if you have
          an old car. About 100 dhs for normal oil &amp; filter change, 300-500
          for oil filter and synthetic oil change.</li>
        <li>Tyre checking, balancing and wheel alignment can be done at similar
          places - usually they sell batteries too. You're unlikely to save much
          by going to a back street tire shop and there are many fake (unsafe)
          tires around - it's doubtful a  shop on the premises of an EPPCO or
          ENOC petrol station would sell dodgy tyres or batteries.</li>
        <li>Mechanical problems - you can get solved cheaply in one of the auto
          repair shops along the main road to Al Awir or in Satwa. Expect to
          get what you pay for. There are better, more expensive places around.
          If you're not sure, best idea is probably to go to main dealer (not
          guaranteed to be reliable but less of a risk than Mr-Very-Cheap-Mechanic-With-Only-A-Spanner-And-Two-Screwdrivers),
          at least until you find a good mechanic through word of mouth. Remember
          that cars under warranty will normally have to go to the main dealer.</li>
        <li>For cosmetic care, petrol station car washes do a reasonably good
          job for about 20 dhs. Make sure you fold in the wing mirrors, remove
          or retract any aerials, and tape up rear window wipers.</li>
        <li>For a good polish and tidy up of your car (eg prior to selling it),
          places like Sara Auto Care in Al Quoz, and Grand Service Station off
          Sheikh Zayed Road near <a href="http://www.dubaifaqs.com/defense-roundabout-dubai.php">Defense Roundabout</a> do a good job for 200-300
          dhs (prices estimate may be old).</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Suggestions when looking for a car to buy in Dubai<a name="tips"></a></h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Buy a light colored automobile - black cars get unbelievably hot
          in the summer. There's a good reason why there are so many white cars
          in Dubai.</li>
        <li>If you buy a leather interior and it's a dark colour, expect second-degree
          burns when it contacts bare flesh after sitting in the summer sun.
          Burns from pale colors shouldn't scar too much.</li>
        <li>Most driving in Dubai will involve frequent stopping and starting
          on flat roads in straight lines, except for intersections. Many will
          say
          there's
          little
          point in getting a manual car. An automatic is less irritating
          in the traffic jams you'll be bound to get stuck in.</li>
        <li>A large 4wd (often called &quot;4-wheel&quot; instead of a &quot;4-wheel
          drive&quot; in Dubai) guzzles petrol and doesn't stop. But it's true
          you'll feel less vulnerable, and there are times it is easier
          to take a short cut over a bit of sand, or park on a pile of dirt.
          Parking on curbs and pavements is also possible but you risk being
          charged 150 dhs by the parking wardens.</li>
        <li>Window tinting is allowed up to 30% for foreigners / expats resident
          in Dubai. It makes the interior noticeably cooler. Cost is 50 to 500
          dhs depending on quality.</li>
        <li>Consider seriously a new or nearly new car (and a loan if you don't
          have cash). Otherwise go the other extreme and buy something very
          old and cheap - at least it won't surprise you if (or when) it falls
          apart although there are sometimes cheap
          reliable cars
          around. In order of likelihood of being reliable consider this list
          for old car purchases (top is most reliable), and remember that car
          parts for posh cars are still expensive even if the car is old.
          <ul>
            <li>Toyota</li>
            <li>Other Japanese</li>
            <li>Mercedes</li>
            <li>Hyundai</li>
            <li>Other Asian</li>
            <li>Skoda/Volkswagen</li>
            <li>The rest would rate as poor to very poor in this order: American/other
              German, British/French/Italian, anything else.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Test driving a car (especially an old banger)</h5>
      <p>Before you start the engine:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look at the dipstick - oil should be clear. If you
            see any muddy grayish color, engine might have cracked head or
          blown gasket (both expensive to fix). If solid black or dark brown,
          it more likely means the owner hasn't it changed for a while (not good
          but not an immediate expensive repair).</li>
        <li>Look at the water - if it's oily, same problem as above. If it's
          low - that indicates at least that maintenance is poor, worse could
        	be an external water leak needing moderately expensive cooling system
        	repairs or an internal water leak needing expensive engine and cooling
        	system repairs.</li>
        <li>Check other fluids that they're at correct levels. It won't tell
          you much about the mechanicals if they're not but it
          does mean
          someone's
          been negligent with maintenance.</li>
        <li>Open and shut all doors gently. If they don't close properly, chassis
          or body may be bent which would usually mean the car has had a bad
          accident and/or a bad repair. It could also just mean the doors are
          out of
          line. You can't usually tell if the chassis/body is straight just by
          looking at it. If it does look bent to you, that means
          it is really really bent and will probably drive like a crab walks.
        	Needless to say, don't buy it unless you just want something to decorate
        	the garden with. </li>
        <li>Look around the car for rust and obvious accident damage. You'll
        	be unlikely to detect a good accident repair. Ask if there's been
        	any crashes though, and be very skeptical if the answer is no - most
        	cars in Dubai have had a ding or two in their lifetime. Look underneath
        	the car for any obvious dents, damage to the chassis.</li>
        <li>Also look at the ground and underneath the car for oil leaks. An
        	oil leak is not necessarily a disaster - many older cars have them -
        	but something to investigate.</li>
        <li>Look at the service history. If it doesn't exist, you may be able
        	to get some information by phoning the main dealer if you have number
        	plate and/or chassis number.</li>
        <li>Look at the tires for wear and damage (check the spare wheel also).
          Try and find the date - if they're older than 3 years, you probably
          won't
          be
          able to register the car since it's supposed to be illegal to have
        	tyres older than 3 years.</li>
        <li>If the tyres are worn obviously unevenly, there's at least a problem
          with alignment (easy to fix) and possibly worse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Start the car but don't drive it yet, just let it idle while you...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check the a/c (air-conditioning) on a hot summer day, preferably
          when the car has sat in the sun for a while. See how long it takes
          for cool
          air
          to come
          through
        at idle (and how smoothly car idles while a/c on full load). It's important
          not to rev up the car - you're trying to strain the system, not make
          it easy.</li>
        <li>If the a/c doesn't work well, it's expensive to fix. Many older cars
        	may have a leaky a/c system but you can top up the gas cheaply. It
        	will of course leak again over weeks/months/years - or seconds if
        	the leaky component breaks. If you're testing an old car with good a/c,
        	it's quite possible the owner has recently topped up a leaky system
        	unless there are records of repairs. You cannot realistically drive
        	a car without a/c from June to September. Really! Ask someone who lives
        	in the UAE if you don't believe it. It is possible but uncomfortable
        	to drive without a/c in April and October, and  tolerable to pleasant
        	from November to March.</li>
        <li>Check every electrical button and switch and control you can find.</li>
        <li>Lift the bonnet and listen to the motor, does it run smoothly? You
          may not have a clue the first time you do this but after listening
          to several cars, you will begin to hear occasional rattles and splutters.
          Secure your long hair, ties and jackets before poking your sticky beak
          under
          the
          bonnet
          near
          fan
          belts
          and
          other moving
          parts. There's also a trick with a big screwdriver that helps here
          but you'll need to find someone mechanical to show you - there's too
          much chance of burning
          or removing fingers to try and explain it here.</li>
        <li>Look at exhaust while someone revs the car a bit (not a lot - it's
          unnecessary). Any smoke should be white/light grey and minimal. Blueish/gray/black
          smoke is not good.  Put a tissue over the end.
          If any oil appears, that should worry
          you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Drive car (turn the stereo off so you can listen to the car)...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You should be trying to listen for unusual
                noises (something grinding or whining is usually much worse than something squeaking),
                and trying to detect any sort of wobbles, vibration, and roughness. Check while driving in a straight line, and around
          corners. Make sure you check with steering on full lock - in both directions
          and while moving. Any clonking sounds are cause for concern.</li>
        <li>Drive in reverse gear for 100m or so to see what visibility is like
          (and to make sure reverse works smoothly). Back the car into a car
          park or driveway also to see how comfortable you are manouvering the
        	vehicle.</li>
        <li> Stop the car hard without holding the steering wheel - but be ready
                to grab it. It should stop in a straight line (check no one is
        	behind you and warn passengers before doing this).</li>
        <li>Don't test the handbrake by trying to drive off with it set - it's
          possible to snap a driveshaft if it works well.</li>
        <li>Drive the car in all gears and change gears often to get a sense
          of how smooth it is. Jerky sloppy changes in an automatic are not a
          good
          sign. In a manual (think about how much time you'll spend exercising
          your left leg in Dubai traffic jams before buying a manual), jerky
          gear changes might indicate a problem with the gearbox, or just the
          driver trying to adapt to the clutch/gearchange combination - watch
          closely how the owner copes with it when driving. If the clutch takeup
          is jerky / sudden, that could be a good sign. It may
          mean there was a new clutch recently. If the takeup is near the top
          of the pedal travel
          and/or
          so
          smooth that you think it's an automatic, that's probably not a good
        	sign. Replacement is moderately expensive, adjustment is cheap. Try
        	to find out when it was last replaced. Clutches are good for 100,000+
        	kms under normal driving. Less than 10,000 kms if used badly or in the
        	desert.</li>
        <li>Similar comments apply to brakes. Soft spongy brakes and long pedal
          travel may mean the fluid is low, or pads almost worn out. Grabby brakes
          with little pedal travel are more likely to indicate reasonably new
          pads. Grinding noises under braking means you've got an expensive pad
          and disc replacement to do. Squeaking noises are an annoyance but unlikely
          to be serious - get it checked anyway.</li>
        <li>If you detect a whining sound, it could be the differential and/or driveshaft (sometimes called propellor shaft) which is expensive to fix, or gearbox (or less likely the engine) which is also expensive. Or wheel bearings which are cheaper to fix. Or tire/tyre noise which probably means new tires. For cars over 5 years old, fixing a differential, gearbox, or engine is going to cost from a quarter to half of the value of the car, and possibly more than the car is worth if it is over 10 years old. Hence the popularity of <a href="http://www.dubaifaqs.com/used-car-parts-dubai.php">cheap second hand motors in Sharjah</a> (which you should think of in the same way as disposable lighters - they'll need to be replaced after a few months). If the whining noise has a continual change in pitch as you accelerate despite gear-changes, then it's in the bearings, drivetrain, or tires. If the whining noise pitch changes abruptly as you change gear, then it's probably in the gearbox (or maybe the engine). </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't make a decision to buy based just on this checklist, it's not
        comprehensive or complete. And there's always the occasional devious
        seller who can disguise problems in such a way the checks above won't
        pick them up. Hopefully it's enough to get you started though.</p>
      <p>Good luck and drive safely!</p>
