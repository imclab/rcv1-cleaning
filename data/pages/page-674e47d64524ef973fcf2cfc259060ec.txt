<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It began when I started wondering
what I want when I go to a movie, read a book, slap on a CD, etc.
Do I want art, or do I want entertainment? Obviously a good deal
depends on context and packaging: one doesn't, unless one is stupid,
go to <B>Godzilla</b> for art, nor does one go to <B>The Ice Storm</b>
for a popcorn-munching wacky evening. Beyond that, though, what
makes something succeed or fail as art or entertainment? Obviously
an infinite number of subjective factors...which is why I plan
to be an idiot and come up with a bunch of guidelines and generalities
that I will shamelessly pass off as the truth, when in fact they
are only the truth of what's in one person's head -- mine -- at
this specific moment in world history.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Anyway, what began as a regular
bite-sized Tirade took on a life of its own and mushroomed, or
metastasized (depending on your view), into a whole other thing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">You may have your own guidelines.
That's great. I'd love to hear them. I'm interested in <I>your</I>
take on art vs. entertainment. I'm not interested in <I>your</I>
take on <I>my</I> take. Don't react -- create. Get in the spirit
of the thing. Don't say &quot;There are no guidelines.&quot; That's
a cop-out, and besides it's no fun. Also, everything I say about
art and entertainment is movie-oriented, though I hope much of
it can be adapted to other media as well.</FONT></P>

  </TR>
</TABLE></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">My favorite oppositional quote
about it comes from David Cronenberg: &quot;Entertainment wants
to give you what you want. Art wants to give you what you <I>don't
know</I> you want.&quot; To continue and riff in that vein, I
offer the following guidelines, to be amplified throughout this
section (and perhaps even contradicted -- hey, I'm makin' this
up as I go)....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Entertainment is part of an
evening -- mini-golf, pizza, a movie, ice cream. Art <I>is</I>
the evening -- you generally have to make plans to see an art
movie, and then you find somewhere to sit and discuss it afterward.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Entertainment is terrified of
losing you, and is willing to change itself to be more to your
taste. Art doesn't give a fuck whether it loses you -- if you're
lost, that's <I>your</I> problem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Entertainment condescends to
what it perceives as your level. Art assumes you're at a high
level and wants to take you higher -- it conascends.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Entertainment wants to make
you <I>think</I> you're thinking, but actually steers you toward
its chosen conclusion. Art actually <I>does</I> make you think,
and allows you to arrive at your own highly subjective conclusion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Entertainment generally isn't
personal or obsessive or visionary. Art often is.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Good entertainment often is
not artistic. Good art often is entertaining.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If entertainment is unappealing,
offensive, and hell to sit through, you just wasted your ticket
money. If art is unappealing, offensive, and hell to sit through...maybe
you should see it again.</FONT></P>

      - Oscar Wilde</FONT></CENTER></TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The dictionary is no help whatsoever
on this word: &quot;An aesthetically pleasing and meaningful arrangement
of elements, as words, sounds, colors, shapes, etc.&quot; Or this:
&quot;Any system of rules and principles that facilitates skilled
human accomplishment.&quot; They might as well just say &quot;things
that don't suck.&quot; If art is so nebulous and subjective as
to resist definition, you may ask, why bother trying to define
it? Well, <I>that's</I> a fine attitude. Why bother doing anything?
Because we believe it's worth doing. Or at least trying to do.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So what is this thing called
art? It's easy to define it by what it isn't (i.e., entertainment
... though art can be entertaining), but let's try to define it
by what it is. Art, to me, is a work that speaks to those who
are willing to rise to it; a work that speaks to all genders,
races, sexualities, religions, etc., at any time and in any place,
and yet is not blandly homogenized -- i.e., it isn't that way
by cowardly design, intended to reach a mass audience. It may
in fact <I>not</I> reach an audience until decades or even centuries
later.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Art is, generally, also selfish.
If it reaches you, it does so almost in spite of itself. Art is
about expressing one's inner state, one's personal vision of the
world. You may respond to it because you share the artist's feelings
and vision; you may not share those things, but respond to the
purity of the vision, the forceful and vivid way it's expressed.
Or it may leave you utterly cold. In which case, who's to blame,
you or the artist? Neither. There's the artist, and here's you,
and the two just don't intersect. It happens.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Art also tends to subscribe
to &quot;less is more.&quot; Art films in particular are often
plotless. When a film is too plotty, too narratively complicated
as opposed to humanly complex, you can feel that it isn't art.
(There are exceptions. BTW, to save space, can we just assume
there are exceptions to everything, so I don't have to keep saying
it?) In his book <B>Understanding Comics</b>, Scott McCloud shows
us a basic icon of a cartoon face, and says that the less detailed
and specific it is, the more we project onto it and see ourselves
in it. A circle with two dots and a dash for a face could represent
you. A red-haired woman in her 30s with a pierced nostril and
eyes of two different colors might not represent you. (Or she
might, but she might not represent the person sitting next to
you.) If a movie features such a character, it's that much harder
to get you to hook into her instead of seeing her as Other or
just a quirky person. Skillful writing would help in that regard,
as would skillful acting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Art is ambitious and tries to
suggest where we are now, or rather, where we always have been
and always will be -- the rest is just details. At the same time,
art does not <I>try</I> to be art. Art that <I>tries</I> to be
art is failed art. Art <I>is</I> art without really trying to
be. Many artists can wax quite eloquent about why they were moved
to do their art, but only after the fact. During the time they're
doing it, the process is highly instinctive, unconscious, subverbal.
It's only afterward that meaning and interpretation are imposed
onto the work by its admirers (or by the artists themselves).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The best art -- and here, in
the realm of film, I think of masterpieces like <B>Citizen Kane</b>,
<B>Taxi Driver</b>, <B>A Clockwork Orange</b>, <B>The Seventh
Seal</b>, too many others to count -- often is not comforting.
It can be disturbing, even depressing or sickening. It doesn't
have to be &quot;entertaining,&quot; in the sense that we generally
perceive the word; more precise adjectives might be &quot;compelling,&quot;
&quot;engrossing,&quot; perhaps even &quot;shocking,&quot; but
not necessarily a popcorn flick, not a movie you'd take home to
meet your mom. But it still leaves you <I>satisfied,</I> the same
basic feeling entertainment gives you. Art gives you what you
didn't know you wanted, scratches an itch you didn't know you
had, and that's part of the thrill of art -- making new connections,
discovering new corners of yourself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Finally, it helps if we genuinely
enjoy the art; we are then inclined to do all the interpretive
work, which is really part of the art -- the admirer brings something
of him/herself to the art and completes it. And this is where
it gets really subjective. One person's art is another person's
pretentious shit. And if you think, say, <B>Crash</b> is pretentious
shit, you're likely to laugh at my fervent theories about its
larger significance. And I can turn around and laugh at your passionate
defense of what <I>you</I> consider art and I consider shit. And
once we're all done laughing at each other and ripping one another's
opinions to shreds, the art is still there, untouched, unaffected
by our arguments pro or con. It will outlive us; it will outlive
its creator. As it should. People come and go, as do trends and
theories about art, but art lives forever.</FONT></P>

entertaining is as subjective as our concept of what art is. Many
people found <B>Independence Day</b> entertaining. I did not.
Many critics were not entertained by <B>Starship Troopers</b>.
I was -- very much. Whether we're experiencing art or entertainment,
our receptive process functions in a similar way, though on different
levels. Either way, we are looking to be <I>transported.</I> It's
wrong to say in entertainment's defense that it's &quot;just escapism.&quot;
Entertainment that fails to take you out of yourself -- that leaves
you sort of sitting there feeling ripped off and wishing you'd
waited for video -- fails as entertainment, and therefore cannot
properly be said to be escapism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Perhaps one wildly generalized
difference between art and entertainment is that the latter takes
you out of yourself and into another world, whereas the former
takes you deeper into yourself, where you and the artist co-create
an inner world. Entertainment is mostly about mass appeal and
plays on the moods and prejudices of the moment. It is generally
unreflective. It is a straight narrative arrow, a good story well
told. (Big exception: <B>Pulp Fiction</b>, which is actually three
straight narrative arrows intersecting.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">There's nothing in the world
wrong with great entertainment. The best entertainment -- my picks
off the top of my head would be <B>Raiders of the Lost Ark</b>,
much of Hitchcock (except <B>Vertigo</b>, which I consider his
one film that succeeds as art; dazzling as his other classics
are, they're entertainment), <B>Treasure of Sierra Madre</b>,
<B>Clerks</b>, dozens upon dozens of others -- gets your blood
going, excites you on a motor level, makes you laugh your ass
off, whatever. Entertainment tends to be visceral, art is more
often cerebral. You can feel an adrenaline rush when a great action
sequence in a Spielberg film is working; when a Woody Allen comedy
or <B>South Park</b> episode reduces you to helpless, breathless,
almost soundless laughter, the response is equally physical. Entertainment
does it to your body and sometimes to your heart; art does it
to your mind and sometimes to your soul.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Entertainment is more about
emotion, and though art is often about expressing emotional states,
it often doesn't allow itself access to populist strategies of
entertainment, like catharsis or tearjerking. When entertainment
fails in that regard -- when you're supposed to cry but instead
sit there dry; when you're supposed to be knocked through the
back wall but instead wait for a scene with a lot of light so
you can read your watch -- then it really fails, big time. Ask
anyone who saw <B>Godzilla</b>. How can entertainment fail? The
same way that art can fail -- you've seen it before, it doesn't
rock your world or your boat, it doesn't do anything for you or
to you, it just kinda sits there.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">But when it works, it can take
you for a ride that art, for all its intensity and complexity,
often can't. It can dazzle you, make you feel like a kid again.
And that's one thing art doesn't do. Art usually assumes you're
mature, and treats you accordingly. Entertainment can be refreshing
in its sheer happy atavism; you willingly regress. Or at least
you do if it's done right. If entertainment fails, you resent
being treated like a dumb kid. When it works, though, you <I>are</I>
a kid again and you don't resent anything. Even entertainment
for adults, like an Albert Brooks film or a John Woo action classic,
can make you respond as an adult the way entertainment you saw
as a kid made you laugh or thrilled you. Entertainment can give
you what you want. Nothing to sneeze at.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It used to be that the popcorn
flicks were reserved for the warmer months -- from May to early
September, when the kids were out of school and in the plexes.
Not any more. In Hollywood, summer is now year-round, and hardly
a week goes by without a moronic comedy or a moronic action film
or a moronic thriller. Consider that two of the first movies of
1998 were <B>Firestorm</b> and <B>Hard Rain</b> -- action no-brainers
that the studios correctly guessed wouldn't survive the tougher
summer competition (and barely survived their January release
-- <B>Hard Rain</b> flopped despite co-starring Minnie Driver,
hot off of <B>Good Will Hunting</b> and sloshing around in wet,
clinging clothes).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">So entertainment, or feeble
attempts thereof, now dominates American theaters as never before
-- while true art movies founder. I don't really understand why
a great film like <B>The Sweet Hereafter</b>, which is not <I>that</I>
difficult or artsy, failed to find a larger audience in America.
In light of all this, it's tempting to elevate art above entertainment
purely on elitist grounds, to root for the underdog against the
corporate monolith. But I've done that before, and I'd like to
take a different approach.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Entertainment is not easy to
do. A seamless, beautifully crafted, consistently engaging mainstream
American movie requires formidable skill. If it were easy to do,
we'd be getting great entertainment every week. The fact is, we
aren't. Most attempts at mass-appeal entertainment end up being
more frustrating and hard to sit through than the most stubbornly
interiorized art film. And art isn't easy either -- there's certainly
a lot of bad art out there, though not as much bad art as bad
entertainment, if only because the studio money is always there
for bad entertainment, whereas less commercial projects have to
appeal to at least a certain number of investors or producers
if they're to be made at all.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Yet I prefer failed art to failed
entertainment, and sometimes I even prefer failed art to good
entertainment. Your average piece of good entertainment is competent,
moving, perhaps intelligent. In other words, it's doing what it's
<I>supposed</I> to do, considering you peeled off seven fucking
dollars for the thing. Failed art, to me, is more valuable because
at least it took a risk. Robert Altman's <B>Short Cuts</b>, James
Mangold's <B>Heavy</b>, Larry Clark's <B>Kids</b> -- these are
several examples in recent years of art films I didn't care for,
but I'm still glad they were made -- I like to see the <I>attempt.</I>
<B>Godzilla</b>, on the other hand, I can't say I'm glad that
was made. Or <B>Six Days, Seven Nights</b>. Or the <B>X-Files</b>
movie.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">I'd rather see a movie that
aims high and misses than a movie that aims low and misses. I
have a kind of bipolar taste in movies anyway -- I love movies
that aim high and hit, like <B>Schindler's List</b>, and I love
movies that aim low and hit, like <B>Starship Troopers</b>. I
don't, however, have much use for movies that aim right in the
bland middle and hit, like <B>The Truman Show</b>, a clever piece
of entertainment that many people are praising as art. <B>The
Truman Show</b> is a textbook example of entertainment that makes
you <I>think</I> you're thinking. It doesn't make you actually
think, unless you haven't seen any of the movies and TV shows
(like <B>Twilight Zone</b>) that handled the same themes before,
and better. It comes on like art in entertainment's clothing,
but beneath the inner layer of art you find a layer of reassuring
themes found in populist entertainment. Right now it looks to
be the year's first Oscar contender. See what I mean?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If art can be entertaining,
can entertainment also be art? Can it do what it does so brilliantly
that it transcends itself? Yes, but rarely. De Palma has done
it, in such films as <B>Blow Out</b> and <B>Casualties of War</b>.
Spielberg has done it -- some of the moments in the <B>Indiana
Jones</b> trilogy are pure cinema, driven by an obsessive momentum
very close to art. That's also true of Sergio Leone, John Woo,
Luc Besson. Somehow the title &quot;entertainment&quot; doesn't
fit such movies as <B>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</b> or <B>Hard
Boiled</b> -- it seems diminishing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Indeed, some rare movies seem
not to fit comfortably into the categories of art <I>or</I> entertainment.
They occupy a realm between. I think of <B>L.A. Confidential</b>,
which, as both book and movie, is hard-driving pulp with the obsessive
complexity of art. A film like <B>L.A. Confidential</b> resists
either-or logic -- it's its own thing. It's neither. It's both.
Does it contradict itself? Very well, then, it contradicts itself.
It is large, it contains multitudes. The term &quot;middlebrow&quot;
was invented for work that cannot be classified as either highbrow
or lowbrow, but it's a pejorative term -- all three terms are
pejorative, actually -- and doesn't allow for the kaleidoscope
of pleasures that a successful blend of art and entertainment
can offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">For me, the premier artist/entertainer
is not any of my three filmmaking gods -- Kubrick, Lynch, or Cronenberg,
artists who don't seem all that interested in entertaining anyone
but themselves and fans like me. No, the guy I'm thinking of is
Scorsese, who grew up on unapologetic pulp entertainment, swam
around in the art of Fellini and Bergman and Godard in film school,
and has managed, in his best work, to combine the best of both
worlds -- the lurid propulsiveness of pulp and the emotional/psychological
complexity of art. It's there in movies like <B>Taxi Driver</b>,
<B>Raging Bull</b>, <B>Mean Streets</b>, and <B>GoodFellas</b>
-- though <B>GoodFellas</b> is more entertainment than art, and
is not his best film, I don't think (I'm ready for the shitstorm
of hostile e-mail on that one).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Scorsese may help me make a
final point, using two of his movies that illustrate the difference
between art and entertainment -- two movies that both star Robert
De Niro as an unhinged stalker, and which I hated at first viewing.
<B>The King of Comedy</b> is an airless and profoundly uncomfortable
black comedy that left me absolutely cold. Then a few years later,
I watched it again in preparation for a college paper on Scorsese,
and it had somehow become a great film, an unsung masterpiece.
Well, of course, the movie hadn't changed -- <I>I</I> had changed.
I was ready for it, ready to accept it. The second movie was <B>Cape
Fear</b>, which completely put me off when I saw it in the theater.
Too in-your-face (literally -- I've never seen so many invasive
close-ups in one movie), too violent (and I have a sky-high tolerance
for movie brutality), too loud, too <I>everything.</I> A few years
later, after preparing by reading J. Hoberman's appreciative review,
I gave <B>Cape Fear</b> a second try on video. I hated it then,
too.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The lesson? For me, it's this:
If a work of art upsets you, bores you, or just generally puts
you off to the point where you never want to see it again ...
wait a while and see it again. It may surprise you. And if a piece
of entertainment has the same bad effects on you ... in all likelihood,
it ain't gonna improve with age. It's gonna remain a piece of
unentertaining shit.</FONT></P>
