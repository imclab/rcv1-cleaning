Hi, My name is Greg Boasberg, and I am the founder of <a href="http://www.sell-cars-for-profit.com">sell-cars-for-profit.com</a>. I'm here to tell you that you can make a lot of money buying and selling cars for a profit. The first car I ever flipped I bought for $1000. The next day I sold it for $1600. I made $600 for a couple hours work. After that it was in my blood. I was so excited I quit my teaching job and became a full time car flipper. Later on I got my dealers license and it's been a thrill ever since. I've been successfully buying and selling cars for a while now and want to help you. Now I usually make anywhere from $1000 to $1500 off of each used car I sell. Sometimes I make in the $2000 to $2500 dollar range. This is not a get rich quick scheme. Whether you're selling cheap cars or luxury cars, becoming successful takes practice and dedication. There are many benefits to being a car flipper and <strong>getting your dealers license.</strong>.
</p>
<ul id="body-ul">
  <LI>The best deals on cars are at <strong>private</strong> dealer auctions.</LI>
  <LI>You can buy trade ins directly from New Car Stores <strong>dirt cheap. </strong></LI>
  <LI>You can sell as many cars as <strong>you</strong> want.</LI>
  <LI>With your special dealer plates you can drive <strong>any vehicle</strong> in your inventory for business or pleasure.</LI>

<h3>Just a few of the other benefits are:</h3>
</p>
<ul id="body-ul">
  <LI>If you have a car dealer license, a smog certificate is good for two years. A smog certificate for a private party is only good for three months.</LI>
  <LI>If you have a car that's registration expired while in your inventory, when you sell it you wont have to pay the penalty fees.</LI>
  <LI>You have the prestige of owning your own business. You will reap all the benefits for your hard work!</LI>
  <LI>You get wholesale prices from Mechanics, Body Shops, Parts Stores, etc. and you don't have to pay taxes on any of them. </LI>
</UL>
<br>
<p>Ready for this? You don't have to pay the high overhead on a car lot. That means more profit for <strong>YOU</strong>!<br />
  Want to make some extra money on the side, or get   out of your dead end job? <strong>SELL USED CARS FOR PROFIT!!! </strong> let's get started.<br>

<p> For only <strong>$19.95</strong> you will receive priceless information.<br>
  I will teach you how to save big time on operating expenses. <br>
  What does that mean? More cash for you to keep. <br>
  You can use it to buy more inventory. <br>
  You could also save it and start a <strong>buy here pay here</strong> operation. <br>
  Sell your cars for more money.<br>
  Finance your customers yourself and charge high interest rates. <br>
  Why have some bank finance your customers when you can do it yourself. <br>
  Why should they collect the interest and take a portion of your profit. <br>
  That's not fair. The name of the game is making money right? When you're just starting out you're going to make a lot of mistakes. <br>
  Not a good idea to take on high overhead when you're first starting out.</p>
<p>The mistakes you make in the beginning can bury you. You can always get a big lot in the future. A lot of guys go out of business early. They get the lot with the high overhead and they do not know what they are doing. <strong>IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE IN THIS BUSINESS </strong>you have to <strong>keep your overhead low in the beginning</strong> because you're going to make mistakes. <strong>How do we learn and grow in business?</strong> By trial and error. Hopefully we learn when we make mistakes and do things different the next time. I mean isn't that the story of life. Let me help you succeed. Learn how to get your dealers license without having to pay the overhead on a lot. </p>
