  <div class="field-content">The man who covered the whole of Cheryl Cole's arse with a tattoo of flowers revealed his magnum opus on Instagram over the weekend. As you might expect, people hit Twitter in their droves to tell Cheryl how horrific it looked, and to ask whether she had meant it to look like she'd been in a chemical fire. Seemingly, Cheryl didn't mind:

"People are entitled to their own opinion. Personally I've never really concerned myself with other people's body parts! I've had it for seven-eight months but only just had it detailed. I can pretty much safely say I'm now done!"

Wonder if she got a bee tattoed above her bumhole? That would certainly be the classy thing to do. Seriously though, it really does look terrible. Really, truly awful. We can only assume it was covering up something even worse, although we can't possibly think what. So we tried to find a picture of Ashley's face in it. AND GUESS WHAT?

TAKE THAT, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM.</div></div>

We mostly used their money and web servers to write about and film The Feeling as much as humanly possible. Sadly we went off them a bit with their last album. But… it turns out the band didn’t like it either. So they’ve gone back to basics and… we’ve had the new album Boy Cried Wolf for a couple of weeks and every song is our favourite song. The Feeling are properly back, Back! BACK!

Unfortunately it has the effect of making her mouth look like it belongs to a gammy witch. Still, doesn’t her skin look smooth? We wonder where she goes to get platelets injected into her face.

  <div class="field-content">The crowd who attended the One Direction: This Is Us premiere were impressive. But it was a premiere – it was expected. But look how many people turned out just to watch Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman filming a new episode of Sherlock. It’s Bene-mania. The Cumbster used all the press attention to make a protest about the detention of David Miranda and the question of civil liberties. What an interesting man.

  <h2><span class="field-content">Saints Row IV review: Lucky number four, that&#039;s right, isn&#039;t it?</span></h2>
  <div class="field-content">The first ten minutes of Saints Row IV has you infiltrating a terrorist base, disarming a nuclear missile, being declared President of the USA, curing cancer and then trying to fight off an alien invasion that places all of humanity in Matrix-esque bio-pods to live their lives out in a simulation. Sounds like the kind of films we used to imagine in primary school, eh? And do you remember how much fun they were? Exactly. (Except for the playing with dog poo bit. Never sure how that used to make it into the final cut)
For those of you new to the Saints Row series, the games are all set in a open world environment similar to Grand Theft Auto, except it's nowhere near as serious. To give you an idea of how not-serious, the main marketing tool for Saints Row 3 was a four foot bat made from a dildo. But even those of you familiar with the previous titles will be blown away by just how crazy and imaginative Saints IV really is. Picture a dildo bat, but without the misogyny and twice the wackiness.
As you might expect, there's not much point in going to deeply into the plot, other than to say the alien invasion in the intro turns out to have been masterminded by the cruel and (naturally) British-sounding Zinyak, head of the Zin, who you'll spend most of your time fighting against in the simulation. This simulation, a recreation of the Stilwater from Saint 2, allows you the biggest departure from previous Saints games in that (after some tinkering) you now have access to a variety of superpowers, including ultra speed (you'll never need to drive again), super-high jumps (no need to worry about fights with the police any more) and the ability to fire ice-blasts (or fights with anyone else, for that matter). Think Prototype and Crackdown, but slightly more developed and interbred.
It's not just new powers though, there's also a whole new arsenal for you to play around with (too many new weapons to go into here; black hole guns, disintegrator rifles and a weapon that causes explosions by firing waves of dubstep at your enemies to name a few) as well as a dizzying array of customisation options. Naturally all this costs cash (called Cache here, geddit?) which you still gain by completing missions and gaining control over different areas of the map. Basically, it's all the fun of the previous titles, including the same brilliant combat mechanic, but with even more firepower.
That being said, we did have a few problems. The intentional graphical glitches (people and walls pixellating and moving around) aimed at letting us know we were in a simulation got a little irritating after a while, as did the fact radio stations no longer switch off automatically (although having said that, Saints IV has some of the best radio playlists in any game to date).
It's also worth mentioning that the dialogue in Saints IV is genuinely hilarious. Not just computer-game hilarious, but actually hilarious. It's been a while since we've actually laughed at a game, and Saints IV's one liners, tongue in cheek pastiches and all out piss-takes of various pop culture references are almost always spot on. It could have been easy &nbsp;to appear smug and knowing, but we didn't get that feeling here even once.
In a nutshell, what Saint IV manages to do so well is that it's just fun, purely and decisively fun. Yes there's an aim to it and bosses to be killed and experience to gain, but by far the overriding point of Saints IV is to have a good time, and it does that fantastically well. Ok, so it's not as beautiful as GTA, nor as ruthlessly accurate as COD, but what it is, is fun to the nth degree.
Saints Row 4 is out now on Xbox 360, PC and PS3. We reviewed the Xbox 360 version.
Below is a gameplay video of some of the major features. Minor spoilers, etc etc etc...</div></div>

  <h2><span class="field-content">Crazy conspiracy lady Tila Tequila has written a book about angels, and it is awful</span></h2>
  <div class="field-content">We've covered Tila Tequila several times in the last year, as she segues from social media whore to nutjob conspiracy theorist, in fact, if it wasn't for Amanda Bynes being driven insane by the success of She's The Man, Tila would absolutely be our most favourite insane celebrity. Pictures David Icke and Tom Cruise trapped in the body of a Vietnamese escort (figuratively speaking of course) and you're pretty much there.
Her most recent move in the fight against our cyborg lizard overlords came as she was forced to launch her own website after being kicked off Facebook. We decided not to look too deeply into exactly why she was banned when this popped up as the top comment on her announcement video:

Anyway. With the launch of Tila's new website also comes her new book, called&nbsp;The Amazing Lost Tales of Arch Angel Annabel Blue. Do you remember at school when they told you not to simply write a series of events when you're telling a story? Tila doesn't. In fact TALTAAAB reads a little bit like the narrator has been smoking magic crystals out of &nbsp;a lightbulb. Here's a little excerpt:

"As more Angels lost their pureness, they started falling down one by one so from the Heavens because due to their loss of purity, and love, they too, lost their Angel Wings, and as they fell from the Heavens they all beseeched God, and vowed that they would take vengeance upon him for treating them with such cruelty. &nbsp;What those fallen and disgraced Angels did not realize that it was not God who had stopped loving them. &nbsp;It was not God who took away all of their beautiful Angel Wings, but it was their own envy towards Arch Angel Annabel that was the ultimate &nbsp;outcome of their unexpected fate."

Wonderful, gripping stuff. Do you want to know what happened to Angel Annabel? Simply pop over to her website&nbsp;(anonymoustruthblog.org, as if it would be anything else) and get yourself a bargain at only £2.99. It's unclear whether the rest of the book had actually been written yet, but you'll get it when it is.
Finally, we'd like to show you one of Tila's recent videos. Skip to about 1.25 for the stuff about cyborgs and to listen to Tila saying 'quote unquote' over and over again. Take a look at the comments if you get a second. Amazing.

  <div class="field-content">The best thing about actors is that they’re stark raving mad. All of them. Naomi Watts appears to be no exception. Faced with the difficult task of portraying one of the best-loved dead people in the world – the late Princess Diana of Hearts, she sought permission from the only person whose opinion mattered: Lady Di herself. Thankfully, the tormented spirit of the dead royal thinks Naomi is doing a bang up job of mimicking that way she used to look up from under her fringe and shyly smile. We hope she haunts to the premiere.

  <h2><span class="field-content">Coronation Street actor suspended after rapping about rape, badly</span></h2>
  <div class="field-content">It's not entirely clear whether this is just a promo for the show or an actual thing that happened (well ok, it's pretty clear), but it seems Coronation Street actor Chris Fountain has been suspended from the show after being outed as controversial rapper The Phantom.
The Phantom is (apparently) notorious for singing graphic raps on YouTube about rape and violence while wearing a mask. As far as we can tell, he only ever had about 30 people listen to him and one of them was his mum, so we're not sure how notorious he actually was. We're also not sure whether that really counts as controversial since a fair amount of modern rap seems to be about exactly those two things, but perhaps it's controversial because he's white. RACISTS.
A statement from ITV bosses reads:

‘ITV find the language used and the views expressed in this video totally unacceptable. Chris Fountain has been suspended pending further inquiries into this matter.’

Fountain meanwhile maintains his innocence, claiming that, a bit like The Wanted, he was just experimenting with expressing himself musically when things turned nasty.

‘I would like to sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. I am deeply ashamed by the lyrics and very much regret my behaviour. The videos were made over a year ago when I was experimenting with music and I’ve not done anything like it since and nor will I.’

Anyway, here's a video of the man in action. As far as we can tell, Fountain's worst crime in this whole sorry episode is being completely shite.

Naturally, NSFW.

Disappointed the picture is such low quality? So were we. So we went to the Craigslist section it was from and tried to find the original ad in order to take a decent screencap. Sadly, we didn't find it, but we did discover that Miami seemingly has a huge number of men with 'large capable hands'.&nbsp;</div></div>
