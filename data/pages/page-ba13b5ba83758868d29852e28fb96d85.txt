food and nightlife share the spotlight with weekly local humor columns
and original comics. Transistor's comprehensive local arts
&amp; entertainment event calendar features an array of traditional and
outsider events, appealing to a wide audience. Limited calendar space,
combined with a crack team of event researchers, and active hunting for
those hidden entertainment gems makes this <i>the</i> go-to event calendar for
Duluth/Superior&mdash;not something to be taken lightly among an
entertainment-oriented audience that demands credible and relevant
information that they will put to use all week long. Every week
features top-notch local writers who cover a variety of timely,
alternative topics, with a distinctive, bitingly funny voice: Top
Picks&mdash;the Transistor's best bets on entertainment
and local culture for the week&mdash;Gettin' Ripped by Slim Goodbuzz, All Bets Off by Mark
Lindquist, Curmudgeon's Corner by Russ Stewart, Make\Out by Ann Klefstad, The Next Level by Paul Lundgren,

the clever, original and eye-catching comix of The Guys Who Never Stop Fighting, The Slightly
Exaggerated True History of Abraham Lincoln, Double Your Efforts, the work of Luke Holden and upcoming featured illustrators.<br>
<br>
&bull; The Transistor is available at high foot-traffic
entertainment areas like UMD, historic &amp; greater downtown

designed for optimal counter space visibility and portability, encourages tourists and locals
alike to pick one up and put it in their pockets to read at their leisure.</p>
