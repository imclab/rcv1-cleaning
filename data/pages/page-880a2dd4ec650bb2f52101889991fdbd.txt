					<h3><a name="Buying_a_Used_Car">Buying a Used Car</a></h3>
					<p>Consumers 
						continue to look to used cars as affordable alternatives to new cars. The buyer&#39;s goal 
						is to find a car at the right price that is also safe and reliable.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<h3><a name="What_car_should_you_buy">What car should you buy</a>?
					</h3>
					<p>Before you begin your search for a good deal on a used car, spend time 
						considering many of the same factors that would apply to a new car purchase: 
						how will you use the vehicle; how long do you plan to keep it; and your budget 
						for the purchase, including insurance, operation, maintenance and repair costs.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Ask friends, co-workers and others about their experiences and satisfaction 
							with their cars--would they buy the car again?
						</li>
						<li>
							Check auto and consumer magazines and books at your local library for 
							information on the reliability records of various models. The annual Consumer 
							Reports Guide to Used Cars can be particularly helpful in pointing out 
							potential repair problems and trouble spots.
						</li>
						<li>
							Find out if a particular vehicle has ever been recalled for safety defects by 
							calling the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#39;s (NHTSA) 
							toll-free hotline (800-424-9393).
						</li>
						<li>
							Check insurance rates with your agent when selecting a car; some cars cost more 
							to insure than others.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<hr />
					<h3><a name="How_much_is_it_going_to_cost">How much is it going to cost?</a>
					</h3>
					<p>To help you investigate and compare prices, consult an established new or used 
						car pricing guide at your local library or on the Web. You may also wish to 
						check local newspaper classified ads for an idea of what used car prices are in 
						your area.</p>
					<hr />
					<h3><a name="Used_car_sources">Used car sources</a></h3>
					<p>Consider the following sources when looking for a used car:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>New car dealers</strong> acquire most of their used cars through 
							trade-in deals. These cars are also likely to come with a limited warranty 
							under which the dealer is obligated to fix problems with the vehicles covered 
							by the warranty.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Used car dealers</strong> generally sell vehicles that have seen a bit 
							more use and abuse than those on the new car dealer&#39;s lot. You may pay 
							less, but the car is less likely to have received needed repairs. Used car 
							dealers also may offer limited warranties.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you are considering buying from a dealer, check out the dealer&#39;s 
						reputation and reliability first. Ask the dealer for the names and numbers of 
						several previous customers, and contact them to find out how they were treated 
						after the sale, and whether the car was as reliable as the dealer represented 
						it to be. Also, call the Better Business Bureau in your locale for any 
						complaints filed against the dealer.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Car rental agencies</strong> may sell used rental cars, generally 9 to 
							12 months old, and driven less than 25,000 miles. The company usually can 
							provide the car&#39;s maintenance and repair records, and may offer a limited 
							warranty. But mileage on rental cars is often high on a per year basis, and the 
							cars may suffer from the wear and tear that comes from use by a variety of 
							drivers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Bank and loan companies</strong> sometimes sell repossessed cars to pay 
							off defaulted loans. Quality varies from car to car. Since the vehicle is 
							being sold to recover the amount due on a loan, it may be possible to get a 
							good deal on a reliable car.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Private owners</strong> usually sell their used cars through newspaper 
							classified ads. Although checking out used cars in newspaper ads may be time 
							consuming, you may find a well-maintained car selling for less money than you 
							would pay a dealer. One of the drawbacks of buying a car from a private owners 
							is that warranty and repair services are not available.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you buy a used car from a private owner, ask for the car&#39;s maintenance 
						and repair records and, if the seller is the first owner, for records of the 
						original purchase. Also, compare the identity of the person selling the car with 
						the person listed on the car&#39;s title or registration.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<h3><a name="About_vehicles_with_salvage_titles">About vehicles with salvage titles</a></h3>
					<p>Regardless of the source, ask to see the seller&#39;s title and registration for 
						the vehicle before agreeing to buy it. These documents will disclose if the car 
						has a &quot;salvage&quot; title. A vehicle with a salvage title has been 
						previously declared a &quot;total loss&quot; by an insurer and should be 
						purchased with extra caution because of the possibility of structural (frame) 
						damage that could affect the safety of the vehicle. You may also obtain a 
						printed history of the vehicle&#39;s ownership from your local Department of 
						Motor Vehicles. You should also know that some lending institutions will not 
						finance a salvage vehicle. For more information on salvage vehicles, call the 
						California Department of Consumer Affairs toll-free telephone number (800) 
						952-5210  and request a free copy of Auto Body 
						ABC&#39;s, or find more information at <a href="http://www.bar.ca.gov/80_BArresources/02_SmogCheck/Salvage_Vehicles.html">http://www.bar.ca.gov/80_Barresources/02_SmogCheck/Salvage_Vehicles.html</a>.
					</p>

					<h3><a name="On-the-Lot_Checklist">On-the-Lot Checklist</a></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>BODY</strong>-- look for rust, particularly at the bottoms of fenders, 
							around lights and bumpers, on splash panels, under doors, in the wheel wells, 
							and under trunk carpeting. Small &quot;blisters&quot; may indicate future rust 
							sites. Check for paint that does not quite match, gritty surfaces, and paint 
							over spray on chrome--all possible signs of a new paint job, masking body 
							problems. Look for cracks, dents, and loose bumpers--warning signs of a past 
							accident.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>TIRES</strong>--Uneven wear usually indicates either 
							bad alignment or  suspension damage. Do not forget to check the condition 
							of the spare tire.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>DOORS, WINDOWS, TRUNK LID</strong>--Look for a close fit and ease of 
							opening and closing. A door that fits unevenly may indicate that the car was 
							involved in a collision.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>WINDOW GLASS AND LIGHTS</strong>--Look for hairline cracks and tiny 
							holes.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>TAILPIPE</strong>--Black, gummy soot in the tailpipe may mean worn 
							rings, or bad valves, and expensive repairs.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>SHOCK ABSORBERS</strong>--Lean hard on a corner of the car and release; 
							if the car keeps rocking up and down, the shocks may need replacing.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>FLUIDS</strong>--Oil that is a whitish color, or has white bubbles, can 
							be a sign of major mechanical problems. Check the radiator fluid; it should not 
							look rusty. With the engine idling, check the automatic transmission fluid; it should not 
							smell rancid, or look dark brown. Check for leaks and stains under the car, on 
							the underside of the engine, and around hoses and valve covers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>LIGHTS AND MECHANICAL PARTS</strong>--Make sure all headlights, 
							taillights, brake lights, backup lights, and direction signals work properly. 
							Test the radio, heater, air conditioner, and windshield wipers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>INTERIOR</strong>--Check the upholstery for major wear and tear; do not 
							forget to look under floor mats and seat covers. Check the steering wheel; 
							unlocked, with the engine off, it should have no more than two inches of 
							&quot;play.&quot;
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>A car with low mileage, but with a lot of wear on the driver&#39;s seat or the 
						brake and accelerator, may indicate tampering with the odometer. A musty smell 
						inside the vehicle could mean that the car was damaged in a flood, or that rain 
						leaks inside the car.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<h3><a name="Road_Test_Checklist">Road Test Checklist</a></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The car should start easily and without excessive noise. Once the car has 
							warmed up, listen for engine noise as you drive; unusual sounds may be signs of 
							major trouble.
						</li>
						<li>
							Drive over rough road surfaces; watch for unusual vibrations, noises, or odors.
						</li>
						<li>
							Make several stops and starts, at varying, but safe, rates of speed on a clear, 
							level road surface. The car should accelerate smoothly and should brake without 
							grabbing, vibrating, or pulling to one side. When you step firmly on the brake 
							pedal, it should feel firm, not spongy.
						</li>
						<li>
							Try turning at various speeds. Too much sway or stiffness can mean bad shocks 
							and/or front end problems. Turn the wheel all the way from one side to the 
							other; power steering should feel smooth, with little or no squealing.
						</li>
						<li>
							Check the wheels for &quot;dog-tracking&quot;--have someone stand behind the 
							car as you slowly drive away--if the back wheels head slightly to one side, the 
							car has major frame problems.
						</li>
						<li>
							Look for these signs of odometer tampering: white lines between the numbers 
							that do not line up, or vibration of the 1/10-mile numbers while the car is 
							moving.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<hr />
					<h3><a name="Technician_Checklist">Technician&#39;s Checklist</a></h3>
					<p>Take the car to a diagnostic center or repair facility for an overall inspection 
						by a technician before you buy it. If the used car dealer refuses to let you 
						take the car to your technician for an inspection, look in the yellow pages of 
						your local telephone directory for a mobile diagnostic service so that the car 
						can be inspected on the car lot. The cost for this service varies, but the 
						money you invest up front may save you many more dollars later. Ask for a 
						written estimate of the costs to repair any problems the technician finds, and 
						use that estimate as a bargaining chip if you make an offer for the car.
					</p>
					<p>If you are unable to make any such arrangement for an inspection, you may want 
						to consider taking your business to another dealer.
					</p>
					<p>The technician should:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Perform an engine compression test
						</li>
						<li>
							Check spark plugs and ignition system
						</li>
						<li>
							Perform a contamination diagnosis of oil and fluids
						</li>
						<li>
							Check transmission fluid
						</li>
						<li>
							Check fan and belts, charging system, power steering and air conditioner
						</li>
						<li>
							Check cooling system: radiator, heater, hoses
						</li>
						<li>
							Check braking system: lining, wheel and master cylinders, drums and front 
							disks, hoses, bearings, grease seals
						</li>
						<li>
							Check suspension: ball joints, tie rod ends, idler arm
						</li>
						<li>
							Check differential or transaxle lubricant
						</li>
						<li>
							Test drive the vehicle
						</li>

					<h3><a name="negotiate">How to negotiate with the seller</a></h3>
					<p>For most transactions, bargaining is still part of the process. Whether you like 
						to bargain or not, you can control the situation by simply keeping the price of 
						the &quot;new&quot; car totally separate from any discussion of what you will 
						think your trade-in (if any) is worth and the warranty terms.
					</p>
					<p>Bargaining can be an exhausting process, so feel free to take a break if you 
						need to collect your thoughts or discuss the terms with someone you trust. 
						Above all, do not let yourself be pressured into a deal with which you are not 
						comfortable just because you are tired of haggling or do not understand exactly 
						what is being offered.
					</p>
					<p>Many sellers--especially dealers--will try to convince you that the car you are 
						looking at is &quot;the best one you can find at that price.&quot; While this 
						may be true, you should be sure in your own mind that the car is worth the 
						asking price based on a thorough inspection by an independent technician or 
						diagnostic service and your own price research.
					</p>
					<p>Your local library may have &quot;how to&quot; books and videos you can check 
						out regarding getting the best deal when buying a car. Look under the subject 
						&quot; automobiles - purchasing.&quot;
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>STEP 1: Getting the best price on the &quot;new&quot; car</strong><br />
							Figure your top price ahead of time--but keep it to yourself. If the 
							salesperson starts to talk about anything other than price (trade-in, 
							financing, etc.), tell him or her that you will discuss that later, after you 
							have agreed on the price of this particular car. It is very important not to 
							reveal your plans for financing or for trading in your current car just yet. 
							Work on a firm cash price for the &quot;new&quot; car first.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>STEP 2: Selling or trading in your current car</strong>
							<p>Whether you plan to trade your present car or sell it yourself, you should know 
								what its wholesale and retail value is (refer to page one for sources).
							</p>
							<p><strong>Wholesale versus retail:</strong> The wholesale value of your current 
								car is the lowest amount your car is worth. The retail value of your car is the 
								wholesale value plus the profit someone will pay to buy your car. Typically, 
								you will receive wholesale value for your trade-in at a new or used car dealer, 
								and you will get the retail value if you sell it yourself.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Trading in your present car:</strong> If you decide to trade-in your 
								present car to a dealership, discuss its value only after you have settled on a 
								price for the &quot;new&quot; vehicle. Make sure you keep your trade-in 
								negotiation separate from the firm price already established for the 
								&quot;new&quot; car. Otherwise, the good deal you get for your new car could be 
								spoiled by the low price you get for your old car.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Selling your car yourself:</strong> You can get an idea for the wording 
								of a newspaper advertisement in the classified section of your local newspaper. 
								The ads can also give you a guide for an asking price of your present car. 
								Before you place an ad, you will need to make sure your car is clean and in 
								good, safe mechanical condition.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>STEP 3: New and used car warranties, buying a car &quot;as is,&quot; and 
								implied warranties</strong>
							<p><strong>The Federal Trade Commission&#39;s (FTC) Buyers Guide</strong>: Whenever 
								you shop for a used car at a dealer&#39;s lot, be sure to read the Buyers Guide 
								that by law must be displayed on a side window of the vehicle. The Buyers Guide 
								will tell you if the dealer is offering a written warranty on the car.
							</p>
							<p>The FTC Used Car Rule specifies that it is deceptive for a used car dealer to:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Misrepresent the mechanical condition of a used vehicle.
								</li>
								<li>
									Misrepresent the terms of any warranty offered in connection with the sale of a 
									used vehicle.
								</li>
								<li>
									Represent that a used vehicle is being sold with a warranty when the vehicle is 
									being sold without a warranty.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Where warranties are given, they often differ, depending on the seller. Whatever 
								the warranty, make sure it is understandable and in writing <b>before</b> buying 
								the car. The warranty should spell out the parts and labor guaranteed, the 
								length of coverage ( in miles and/ or days)., and a deductible charge for 
								warranty service (if any). If the used car is a recent model, the original 
								manufacturer&#39;s warranty may still be in effect.
							</p>
							<p>Many used cars come without any warranties at all. These cars may be sold 
								&quot;as is&quot; or &quot;with faults,&quot; as long as this is fully 
								disclosed in the <em>FTC Buyers Guide</em>.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Used car or dealer warranties:</strong> The best time to negotiate for a 
								used car warranty is <strong>after</strong> you have agreed on a price for the 
								car. If you try to get a salesperson to come up with a warranty before a price 
								for the car is set, you will pay a higher price for the car.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Buying a car &quot;as is &quot;:</strong> If no written warranty is 
								offered, the <em>Buyers Guide</em> tells you that the dealer assumes no 
								responsibility for repairs and that you will pay all costs for any needed 
								repairs. Usually, the dealer has no further responsibility for a car sold 
								&quot;<strong>as is</strong>&quot; once the sale is complete and you drive off 
								the lot.
							</p>
							<p>If, during negotiations, the seller or dealer makes any promises about repairing 
								problems with the vehicle, add each of these promises to the written contract. 
								If the contract is silent about these items or describes the sale &quot;as 
								is,&quot; you will have a very difficult time enforcing the seller&#39;s oral 
								promises later.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Implied Warranties:</strong> An implied warranty is a general, unwritten 
								warranty of fitness. The principle of &quot;implied&quot; warranties is that 
								any car you buy can be safely purchased on the assumption that it is roadworthy 
								and will perform for a reasonable amount of time without undue expense or 
								trouble on your part. The implied warranty may be disclaimed by the seller, 
								however, when you buy a car &quot;as is. &quot;
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<hr />
					<h3><a name="Tips_to_keep">Tips to keep in mind before buying a used car</a></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Before you go to the first dealer, try to arrange financing with your bank, 
							credit union, or other financial institution. Compare finance charges to find 
							the best deal.
						</li>
						<li>
							Know beforehand what the total cost will be, including price, down payments, 
							the interest rate and monthly payments.
						</li>
						<li>
							When you are ready to actually go look at cars, take someone with you 
							whose experience and judgment you trust.
						</li>
						<li>
							Do not sign any documents until you have read and understand them. Make sure 
							there are no blank spaces, all of the salesperson&#39;s verbal promises are 
							included, and the type of warranty that comes with the car is spelled out.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you are required to make a deposit, ask whether it is refundable and under 
							what circumstances, and make sure the information is also included in the 
							contract (the contract may be your only receipt).
						</li>
						<li>
							Before buying a used car, have your own technician inspect it. A used car may 
							have major mechanical or structural problems; replacement parts may be hard to 
							find; the seller may misrepresent the car&#39;s mileage or condition; and 
							warranty coverage may not be available.
						</li>
						<li>
							The &quot;three-day cooling off period&quot; for canceling a contract does NOT 
							apply to new or used car purchases. Many consumers think that it does apply, 
							but it does not. As of July 1, 2006 the &quot;Car Buyers Bill of Rights&quot; 
							offers the &quot;option&quot; of a cooling off period of 2 days for a fee.
						</li>
						<li>
							For used cars, a dealer is required to make sure the car is in safe working 
							order before it leaves the lot. This means the car must have brakes, lights, 
							etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							Verify that the vehicle&#39;s California registration is current. If not, you 
							may be subject to late fees and penalties imposed by the Department of Motor 
							Vehicles. Also, the registration will disclose if the manufacturer repurchased 
							the vehicle under <a href="http://www.dca.ca.gov/acp/">California&#39;s 
								warranty (Lemon) law.</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							When a used vehicle is sold in California, the seller is legally responsible 
							for providing a smog certificate. The seller is obligated to ensure the 
							vehicle&#39;s emission (smog) control equipment complies with the state&#39;s 
							emission control equipment requirements. Even when a smog certificate is 
							supplied, however, beware that you may be purchasing a vehicle that is not in 
							compliance. It is advisable to pay for an inspection at a station of your 
							choice as a precaution. Also, check for the underhood label showing whether the 
							vehicle was manufactured to meet either California or U.S. emissions standards. 
							For more information on smog requirements, call the California Department of 
							Consumer Affairs toll-free telephone number, (800) 952-5210, and request a free copy of <a href="/80_BARResources/02_SmogCheck/Used_Vehicle_Smog_Equip_Req.html">
							 Smog Equipment Requirements for Used Vehicles</a>. Note: waivers
							 are not granted when a smog certificate is required for change of 
							ownership.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the registration fee is paid to the dealer, the dealer has 30 days to 
							forward it to the <a href="http://www.dmv.ca.gov">Department of 
								Motor Vehicles. </a>
						</li>
						<li>
							California&#39;s Lemon Law only applies to new cars still covered by the 
							manufacturer&#39;s original warranty; most used car buyers are not protected so <b>beware!</b>
