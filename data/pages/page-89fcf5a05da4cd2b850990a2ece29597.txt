				<h2>Information on Smog Check, Transfers, Title and Registration</h2>
                <p align="center"><em><strong>DMVSolutions.org is a privately owned website that is not affiliated with the California DMV or any government agencies.</strong></em></p>
				<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles 
				  transfers millions used vehicles each year. 
				  Information about your smog requirements, title, 
				  transfer, registration,'bill of sale', and other 
				  forms can be found on the official California 
				  DMV web site. </p>
				  <p align="center"><a href="http://www.cash4usedcars.com/sell/" target="_blank"><img src="images/ad.jpg" alt="Sell your Car, Truck, Van or SUV here." width="302" height="251" border="0" ></a></p>
				<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles 
				  has set up a very informative web site enabling 
				  you to access basic information about all of 
				  your used vehicle needs. Actual transfer of 
				  ownership or other specific needs may require 
				  you actually visit your local DMV.</p>
				  <p><img src="images/family.jpg" width="163" height="90" align="left" alt="Find DMV information easily with DMVsolutions.org">Our 
				  direct link access will guide you to that specific 
				  information. Remember, due to the high volume 
				  of California DMV transfer of used vehicles 
				  you may need to call and set up an appointment.</p>

				<a name="smog"></a>
				<h3>Smog Check</h3>
				  <p>The State of California has one of the most 
				  strict vehicle smog requirements in the country. 
				  Each year millions of vehicles are subject to 
				  a smog inspection. The California DMV will update 
				  the vehicle year requirements on their web site 
				  and notifications are sent by mail. California 
				  smog machines are now directly linked to the 
				  state headquarters in Sacramento and all vehicles 
				  that pass or fail are immediately entered into 
				  the state database.</p>
				<a name="transfers"></a>
				<h3>Transfers</h3>
				<p>To transfer a used vehicle from one private party to another,
				  we recommend both parties
				  go to the Department of Motor vehicles in your
				  area and transfer together. This ensures both
				  parties it is done correctly with no chance
				  of fraud or misrepresentation. With a proper
				  DMV printout, known as a 'KSR&quot;, each party 
				  can be assured of any tickets against the vehicle, 
				  late registration fees, penalties owed, or more 
				  serious problems such as a &quot;DOJ Stop&quot; 
				  which refers to a law enforcement problem prohibiting 
				  title transfer.</p>
				  <a name="title"></a>
				  <h3>Title</h3>
				  <p>Each used vehicle will have a State specific 
				  title with a title number. This needs to be 
				  looked at by a DMV expert who will look for 
				  fraudulent titles, not valid titles, and titles 
				  from a different State that may require additional 
				  documentation. In the case of a 'lien' on the 
				  title, the bank or credit union who holds title 
				  (or lien release papers) will have to be contacted 
				  and paid. At this point, the lien will be satisfied 
				  and title will be free to transfer.</p>
				  <a name="registration"></a>
				  <h3>Registration</h3>
				  <p>Every vehicle on the road must legally have 
				  a current registration. Some vehicles may qualify 
				  for a &quot;Certificate of Non-Operation&quot; 
				  which allows a used vehicle to be free of penalties 
				  while in a non-operational state. In general, 
				  the DMV can run a background check on a used 
				  vehicle by the license number or vehicle identification 
				  number (VIN#). This provides an exact assessment 
				  of any fees owed, tickets not paid, or other 
				  registration problems.<br>
				  <br>
				  When selling a used vehicle, please be aware 
				  of current 'scams' involving a fraudulent cashiers 
				  check or the buyer asking for money back because 
				  he accidentally made the cashiers check for 
				  too much money. This is a nationwide scam where 
				  thousands of people have lost their vehicles 
				and money.</p>
