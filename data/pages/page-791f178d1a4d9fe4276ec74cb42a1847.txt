      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An acquaintance with and an 
      understanding of literary characters is one of the first ways a young 
      child has of making sense of what it is to be human. We all come to know 
      more clearly who and what we are while reaching out, imaginatively, for 
      what we might become. As the child dwells in and wonders at the lives 
      lived in story, she comes to know both herself and the world and begins to 
      see that world as something over which she, as a character in life, might 
      exercise some control. The events of story are a means of exploration of 
      the world, helping her to confirm, to illuminate, and to extend her own 
      life experiences, in ways that give her power over them. Story gives 
      public form to private meanings and thus helps those who receive its 
      messages to reach out to other human beings in the world, knowing that 
      they share some of the same concerns and feelings. Informational 
      narratives are also important forms of children's literature and ways for 
      young people to understand and appreciate their world and those who share 
      it with them. We all need to learn about life both literally and 
      literarily, efferently and aesthetically. </FONT>

      best and the latest thinking about the constellation of topics that will 
      enable them to bring the two together most successfully. The reading 
      bibliography is basic to gaining a rich background in the 
field.</FONT></P>
