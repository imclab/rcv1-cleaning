    <p>Liberty Auto Parts and Salvage Company officially opened its doors in 
      1932 under the leadership of brothers Al and Bill Gelfand, and their brother-in-law 
      Mannie Schwartz. Bill and Al eventually sold their shares of the company, 
      leaving Mannie with sole ownership. In 1975, Arthur Schwartz became the 
      second-generation owner when his father turned over the reins of running 
      the company. Arty expanded the company into a major competitor in the automotive 
      salvage industry. Then in 2008, Brad Schwartz became the third-generation 
      owner of Liberty Auto. Under his guidance, Brad moved the company forward 
      into the 21st century, embracing the age of advanced technology, and continually 
      works to maintain the competitive edge that Liberty holds over the industry. 
    </p>
    
	<p> Liberty is one of the few remaining salvage yards in the city of St. Louis. 
      It is one of the largest privately owned automotive recycling centers in 
      the Midwest,  operating on 10 acres of property. With plenty of 
      storage space and millions of parts in stock, Liberty sells and ships to 
      individuals, shops, and dealerships all over the country. Liberty also has 
      free delivery service throughout the St. Louis region and parts of Illinois. 
      Their focus is on late model salvage, both domestic and foreign. They sell 
      quality recycled parts for cars, trucks, vans, and SUV&#8217;s, and have 
      a national locating service to help find parts not in their own inventory. 
    </p>
	
	<p> Liberty strives toward integrity, quality, and responsible customer service. 
      Their countermen are some of the most knowledgeable in the entire industry. 
      They continually assess and review how they can improve their operations 
      and customer relations. Throughout the years and the many changes that have 
      affected the salvage business, the people at Liberty are proud that they 
      have remained a leader in the automotive recycling industry.</p>
