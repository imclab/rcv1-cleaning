                <h3></h3>
                Since we've perfected the art of island living, it only makes since we also put it on display. The galleries on Sanibel, Captiva, Pine Island and Matlacha especially are proof positive of our eye for beautiful aesthetics. Theaters, too, seem to hold performances on a nightly basis in converted schoolhouses and old Vaudeville stages alike. If all else fails, just listen for the sound of live music coming from the closest bar and pull up the nearest chair.

                    <h3>"Aruba, Jamaica... oooh, I'd rather take you to Fort Myers, Sanibel and Fort Myers Beach -- if you're looking for tropical tunes and island rhythms. "</h3>
                    <p><p>With a bit of the Beach Boys, a riff of Jimmy Buffett and a backbeat of reggae, calypso and steel drum, the live music scene on The Beaches of Fort Myers &amp; Sanibel delivers island flavor and tropical harmony.</p>
<p><strong>Singers, musicians and tunesmiths</strong><br />A number of local musicians perform the island sounds that visitors from cold northern climes long for. Danny Morgan, one of the area's longest-playing bands, does Jimmy Buffett along with original tunes, including Captiva Moon and Beautiful Sailboard Ride. Versatile John McLane plays everything from sax to steel drums.<br />Greg Roché and Noble Hochmeister are two other local talents with a tropical twist. They cover the Beach Boys, Buffett, Bob Marley and others with guitar and vocals. For purely positive vibrations, The Reggae All-Stars is an all-Jamaican band with a sound that won't let you sit still. For a bit of Cajun-Zydeco flavor, look for The Yard Dogs.</p>
<p>Watch for these artists to appear around the area, and read below to find out where you can hear them and others live.</p>
<p><strong>Jammin' on the beaches</strong><br />For those in search of true beach party tunes, look no farther than the clubs of Fort Myers Beach. Around the Times Square area, music drifts across the waves from Cottage Bar, Beach Pierside Grill, Beached Whale and Lani Kai Resort. The Yard Dogs frequent the stage at Pinchers Beach Bar &amp; Grill at the Holiday Inn. Parrot Key Caribbean Grill lives up to its name, with tinkling sounds from the islands.</p>
<p><strong>Reggae in the islands</strong><br />On Sanibel and Captiva Islands, resorts, restaurants and clubs host musicians on a regular basis, many of them with a Caribbean flair. On Sanibel, the Jacaranda Bar is the hottest spot for dancing, often to reggae bands. John McLane is a regular at Thistle Lodge Sunday brunch at Casa Ybel Resort, and Danny Morgan plays twice weekly at Traders Café, a favorite among locals.</p>
<p>Captiva Island is always jiving, and you can hear tunes spilling out of Keylime Bistro at Captiva Island Inn and RC Otters just about any time of day. Steel drum and other solo acts entertain six nights a week on the beach at Mucky Duck. For dancing, hit the Crow's Nest at 'Tween Waters Inn. Danny Morgan also performs on Captiva Cruises' Sunset Serenade excursions.</p>
<p><strong>Tunes in town</strong><br />In downtown Fort Myers, you're likely to hear blues or jazz at popular clubs including City Tavern. If you're in a mellow mood, slip into Bell Tower Shops every other Friday for contemporary, easy-listening music. Nearby at Shoeless Joe's in the Crowne Plaza Hotel, guitarist and singer Jeff Key entertains.</p>
<p><strong>Good vibrations on the Cape</strong><br />Cape Coral is home to the Yard Dogs, who perform weekly at the Twisted Conch, a Caribbean-style grill. Live country and rock-and-roll bands fill the streets during the Coconut Festival, held in November.</p>
<p><strong>Local flavor in Pine Island</strong><br />Don't necessarily expect ""tropical tourist tunes"" in Pine Island, where the locals tend to favor classic rock, blues, bluegrass and country rock. Do expect funky, let-your-hair-down fun at Ragged Ass Saloon, Bert's Bar &amp; Grill and Woody's Waterside. The latter often presents solo artists who play island tunes."</p></p>

                    <h3>"The new gallery features impressive artwork and an uplifting message, bringing the Olympic spirit to downtown Fort Myers in full force. "</h3>
                    <p><p>Winning isn’t everything – it’s doing your best that matters most, and creativity and balance are key. That’s the thinking behind the new Art of the Olympians gallery in downtown Fort Myers’ historic River District.</p>
<p>Based on the ancient tenets of the Olympic Games, where athletes nurtured their artistic as well as athletic abilities, the gallery came to life through the vision and passion of former Olympian Al Oerter. A consecutive four-time discus gold medalist, Oerter lived and painted in Fort Myers Beach many years before his death in 2007. His family members and fellow Olympians worked to bring the one-of-a-kind gallery to fruition. It opened in January 2010, just in time for the Vancouver Winter Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>The Star Attraction: Art &amp; Sport</strong><br />One of only four locations in the U.S. permitted by the U.S. Olympic Committee to use the Olympian name and their logo, Art of the Olympians (AOTO) displays Oerter’s work along with that of more than 30 others – from fencers to bobsledders, Americans to Australians, sculptors to poets.  The art is showcased in a new, ultra-modern building with Mediterranean accents, located on the banks of the Caloosahatchee River. The light and airy second-floor gallery overlooks the river and displays a 125-piece collection. Here’s just a sampling of the art:</p>
<p>Peggy Fleming’s mixed media representation of the Olympic rings and a sketch of her Olympic figure skating routines.  Abstract paintings by the late gold medalist runner Florence “Flo-Jo” Griffith JoynerIntricate and realistic pencil sketches by Liston Bochette, a decathlon and bobsled Olympian.  Olympic portraits by Fijian athletics competitor Tony Moore&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Eye-catching graphic designs by record long-jumper Bob Beamon.</p>
<p>On the building’s first floor, the Al Oerter Educational Center of Excellence features multi-media Olympic exhibits, touring exhibitions and presentations by Olympians.</p>
<p><strong>The Journey: Unique Exhibit to Permanent Gallery</strong><br />Oerter worked with fellow Olympian and artist Liston Bochette (a Fort Myers resident who represented Puerto Rico) to put together the region’s first display of Olympian art. The exhibit, which included the works of 12 international athlete-artists, was held at Fort Myers’ Alliance of the Arts in conjunction with the 2006 Winter Games in Torino, Italy.</p>
<p>They envisioned a permanent home for the growing collection and chose Fort Myers, then began planning and fundraising. According to Bochette, Oerter thought of the gallery as a “small diamond” and wanted its permanent home to be a place where people would want to come see it.</p>
<p>After Oerter passed away, family and fellow athletes carried the torch, making a presence and garnering attention with an exhibit at the 2009 Summer Games in Beijing. The Olympic community embraced the idea. Gold medalist figure skater Peggy Fleming narrated an hour-long documentary about the gallery that aired nationwide. Another famous former Olympian, bobsledder Prince Albert of Monaco, has pledged international fundraising support. With the backing of the Olympic community, AOTO directors expect to draw 300,000 visitors a year to the Fort Myers art attraction.</p>
<p><strong>The Victory: A Winning Message</strong><br />Cathy Oerter says her husband had a commitment to fusing body, mind and spirit. “He always said art and athletics are quite the same, except art is a lot easier on the shoulders and knees,” she said. Her husband decried egotism in sports and worked hard to educate future athletes about Olympic values, seeking to promote athletic social responsibility in the modern world.</p>
<p>One of Al Oerter’s most notable quotes is: “I didn’t set out to beat the world; I just set out to do my absolute best.” The Art of the Olympians gallery and its Center for Excellence offer a fitting, lasting tribute to Oerter – and a world of inspiration for anyone who visits."</p></p>
