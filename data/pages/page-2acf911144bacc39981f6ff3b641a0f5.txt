Books<br>
      <br>
      </span></big></big>Children&rsquo;s
literature
has often been viewed as perhaps less
valuable, this however is not the case for the value of literature
comes from
three primary areas. First it as value as a form of human expression
and emotion
a way for people to connect with each other. And books for children are
indeed
such a form of connection, they are often an expression of the deepest
emotions
of people, from McCloskey who created beautiful picture books of Maine,
to the
much acclaimed Harry Potter, children&rsquo;s literature is a deep
expression of
human emotions, desires, and beliefs.<br>

            <br>

Literature as a message is also
intended to shape those who
read it (at least good literature is). Steinbeck, Hemingway, and more
all had
the goal of getting a message out and thereby affecting the society in
which
they where in.&nbsp;<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big></big> </div>



      
      <p class="MsoNormal">Is not children&rsquo;s literature a method of
shaping? Indeed as a
child is much more susceptible to being shaped it can be argued that
children&rsquo;s
literature does this much better then any novel intended for adults
ever could.</p>

      
      <p class="MsoNormal">Literature is also a form of
entertainment, something that
children&rsquo;s literature most certainly is as well. Great
literature for children
is more then this however as picture books is often created to be read
by one
person to another. In other words picture books can be a form of
entertainment
for adults and kids alike. They are often a social form of
entertainment and so
have direct social value. </p>


      
      <p class="MsoNormal">In all ways then
children&rsquo;s literature is as important or
perhaps more important social then that which is created for adults.
Because of
this importance it is defiantly worth studying, both for the purposes
of
allowing the public to know what it does and how it works, but also to
allow
those who create children&rsquo;s books to understand it.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;" class="MsoNormal">The
need for a Cross Cultural Analysis of Children's Literature</p>


      
      <p style="text-align: center;" class="MsoNormal">Cross-Cultural
Analysis is about more then simply a study of another culture, or in
this case another cultures books for children. Cross-Cultural studies
are a comparison, a way of finding out both the importance and impact
of aspects of cultures by viewing other cultures. It is often a very
systematic approach to studying cultures, as will as our own.
Children's books and literature in general is a cultural phenomenon,
children's literature is our way of passing on our thoughts to the next
generation, of socializing them. It is also our way of communicating
what we are as a culture. Certainly different writers and different
groups have different messages within our country, this however only
indicates even more the need for children's literature to be analyzed
using cross-cultural methods. To help us understand what values we are
transmitting using different types of books and pictures.&nbsp;</p>


      
      <p style="text-align: center;" class="MsoNormal">Cross
cultural
research in children's literature can also help us come to understand
what values are truly important to society as a whole, by examine the
values that different societies emphasize as compared to the values
other societies emphasize we can come to understand both societies
better. Certainly a simple study of literature could give us some idea
of what values exist in children's books, we could discover through
this how often the certain values appear in the children's books.
However this gives us no idea of how valuable such things are compared
to another culture, at least in literary message, nor does it allow us
to gage the full impacts of such messages. As debates rage among the
educational community about the actual impact of different types of
entertainment on children, the only solution is through comparisons of
the actual impact of such things. Certainly culture in general can be a
factor which would tend to make such comparisons difficult, however any
major research in the social sciences and humanities requires multiple
tools to be successful. &nbsp;And Cross cultural research could be
such
a tool.</p>
