	<div style="border:1px solid black;background-color: #FFFFCC;padding:4px">
	<p>And it came to pass <i>that</i> the sons of Kahn, who dwelt in the valley 
	of Scotts, in the land of Cali-fornia, fell upon hard times. For they were 
	hard plagued by the Mic-rosoftees who dwelt in the north, yet ruled all the 
	lands around, and forced all to bow down and pay tribute before <i>their</i> 
	god Vi Su-Albahsic. And there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth in the 
	valley, <i>and</i> also much careful reading of the Situations Vacant 
	columns.</p>
	<p>And then An-ders, an elder in the tribe of the sons of Kahn, <i>dreamed</i> 
	a dream. And he called together all the tribe and spake unto them saying: 
	Brothers - last night I dreamed that everyone in the world paid tribute to 
	the god Vi Su-Albahsic. And the Mic-rosoftees did come down <i>into</i> the 
	valley of Scotts, and forced all men who dwelt there to worship Vi Su-Albahsic. 
	And the sons of Kahn gave in and became programmers like Jerripur-Nel, the 
	scribe of Bytemag, <i>who</i> toileth still upon Roberta&#8217;s Basic flash-card 
	program; yea, yet he hath toiled upon it for seven and four-score years or 
	more, as it seemeth to me.</p>
	<p>And An-ders spake, saying: Do you want <i>this</i> to happen?</p>
	<p>And the sons of Kahn replied as one saying: Indeed, we sodding well do 
	not.</p>
	<p>And so the sons of Kahn looked once more upon Tur Bhopas-kal, and into 
	the void <i>which</i> was called Owl. And they saw <i>that</i>, while 
	calling it a void was a tad unfair, there was plenty of scope <i>for</i> 
	improvement. And An-ders and Gar&#8217;ee and Zackur-Lockur and Giant I and many 
	others girded up their loins, and toiled long and hard. And together they 
	fashioned TObject.</p>
	<p>And TObject conceived, and begat TPersistent. And TPersistent begat 
	TComponent, and TComponent begat TControl, and TControl begat TWinControl, 
	and TWinControl begat TCustomControl, and TCustomControl begat TCustomGrid, 
	and TCustomGrid begat TDrawGrid, and TDrawGrid begat TStringGrid.</p>
	<p>And TObject also begat Exception, and Exception begat EMathError, and 
	EMathError [<i>that&#8217;s enough begatting - Ed.</i>]</p>
	<p>And so it came to pass that the fruit of TObject&#8217;s loins were indeed 
	fruitful, and the whole multiplied much. And the tribe of TObject&#8217;s children 
	was known as Veesee-ell. And Tur Bhopas-kal was henceforth named by the name 
	of Delphi, by decree of the department of market, who had once spent a happy 
	fortnight in Corfu, and was wise in the ways of the Greeks.</p>
	<p>When the sons of Kahn looked upon Veesee-ell and Delphi, and they saw 
	that Delphi micturith upon the head of Vi Su-Albahsic, as though from the 
	top of the mountain of Rockee.</p>
	<p>And the sons of Kahn were glad within their hearts, indeed they were well 
	chuffed.</p>
	<p>And there was much wining and celebration and slaughtering of fatted 
	calves in the valley of Scotts, <i>with</i> plenty of alcohol-free and 
	meat-free alternatives laid on for those who cannot partake of strong drink 
	or murdered animals for reasons of medication or creed or obstinacy, or 
	because <i>their</i> girlfriends won&#8217;t let them.</p>
	<p>And by all a good time was had.</p>
	<p>And it came to pass that two seasons came and went. And the first season 
	was rich and fruitful for the sons of Kahn, and their bellies grew round and 
	plump with milk and honey.</p>
	<p>But the second season was thin and lean, and was a time of famine. For 
	verily the department of market of the sons of Kahn was not unpractised at 
	snatching defeat, yea even from the very jaws of victory. And the sound of 
	weeping and wailing was heard once more in the valley.</p>
	<p>And one day An-ders journeyed to the wilderness, and wept and wailed and 
	cried out unto the Lord, saying &#8216;Shall I spend the rest of my days tinkering
	<i>with</i> a Pascal compiler I wrote 15 years ago? Couldn&#8217;t I have a go at 
	something else? Shall I never have stock options which consistently increase 
	in value? Can I not be on the winning side <i>for</i> a change?&#8217;</p>
	<p>And it so happened <i>that</i> nearby stood a scout for the tribe of the 
	Mic-rosoftees, disguised as a juniper bush. And he heard An-ders cry out. 
	And he came forward to An-ders, saying, &#8216;Can I be of assistance?&#8217;</p>
	<p>And one thing led <i>unto</i> another.</p>
	<p>And when the sons of Kahn heard what had happened, they put upon the 
	matter a brave face saying: An-ders hath worked <i>but</i> a little on 
	recent releases, we will be on time with Delphi 3.0, we are sorry to see him 
	go, of course, but this will not impact any of our technology.</p>
	<p>But friends of the sons of Kahn remembered the wisdom of M&#8217;andee-rice 
	Davis. And <i>such</i> men were sore afraid <i>for</i> the sons of Kahn.</p>

people are not aware of the best reincarnation of Sir Arthur Conan 
Doyle's most famous character. <span class="yellow">Starting in 1984, 
<span class="r">Granada Television</span> in the UK 
spent an enormous amount of money to recreate a section of London England (circa 
1895-1905) right down to the carriages, gas lanterns, and costumes</span>. They only 
used stories by Doyle so you won't find Holmes fighting the Nazi's as we have 
seen in other incarnations from Hollywood. Jeremy Brett plays Holmes and is 
the most believable of all to date. Granada even goes so far as to end certain 
scenes with the actors standing in the same positions as the illustrations as 
originally published 
in <span class="r">The Strand Magazine</span>. The 
series is always running on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/" >PBS</a> in North

<h3><a id="dragon_tattoo"></a>Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</h3>
		<strong>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</strong> 
		(official <a href="http://dragontattoofilm.com/">web site</a>)<br>A 
		discredited journalist and a <span class="yellow">mysterious computer hacker</span> discover that 
		even the wealthiest families have skeletons in their closets while 
		working to solve the mystery of a 40-year-old murder. Inspired by late 
		author Stieg Larsson's successful trilogy of books, THE GIRL WITH THE 
		DRAGON TATTOO gets under way as Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander 
		are briefed in the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, whose uncle suspects 
		she may have been killed by a member of their own family. The deeper 
		Mikael and Lisbeth dig for the truth, however, the greater the risk of 
		being buried alive by members of the family who will go to great lengths 
		to keep their secrets tightly sealed.<br><br><strong>The Girl Who 
		Played With Fire</strong>  
		(official <a href="http://dragontattoofilm.com/">web site</a>)<br>Mikael Blomkvist is about to run a story that will expose an extensive sex 
trafficking operation between Eastern Europe and Sweden, implicating well-known 
and highly placed members of Swedish society. On the eve of publication, the two 
investigating reporters are murdered and the fingerprints found on the murder 
weapon belong to Lisbeth Salander.<br><br><strong>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</strong> (was
		<a href="http://dragontattoofilm.com/">theatrically 
		released</a> in North America on Oct-29, 2010)<br>In this last 
		installment, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) lies in critical condition, 
		a bullet wound to her head, in the intensive care unit of a Swedish city 
		hospital. She&#8217;s fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when 
		she recovers, she&#8217;ll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three 
		murders. With the help of her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist 
		(Michael Nyqvist), she will not only have to prove her innocence, but 
		also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the 
		vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. And, on her own, 
		she will plot revenge &#8211; against the man who tried to kill her, and the 
		corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life. <br><br>Charlie Rose Interviews:<ul>
