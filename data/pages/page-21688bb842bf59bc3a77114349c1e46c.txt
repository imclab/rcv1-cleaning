<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Definitions of the word literature tend to be circular. <i>The Concise Oxford 
Dictionary</i> says it is &#147;writings whose value lies in the beauty of form or 
emotional effect.&#148; The nineteenth-century critic Walter Pater referred to &#147;the 
matter of imaginative or artistic literature&#148; as a &#147;transcript, not of mere 
fact, but of fact in its infinitely varied forms.&#148; But such definitions really 
assume that the reader already knows what literature is. And indeed its central 
meaning, at least, is clear enough. Deriving from the Latin <i>littera,</i> &#147;a 
letter of the alphabet,&#148; literature is first and foremost mankind&#146;s entire body 
of writing; after that it is the body of writing belonging to a given language 
or people; then it is individual pieces of writing.</p>
<p>But already it is necessary to qualify these statements. To use the word 
writing when describing literature is itself misleading, for one may rightly 
speak of &#147;oral literature&#148; or &#147;the literature of preliterate peoples.&#148; The 
art of literature is not reducible to the words on the page; they are there 
because of the craft of writing. As an art, literature is the organization of 
words to give pleasure; through them it elevates and transforms experience; 
through them it functions in society as a continuing symbolic criticism of 
values.</p>
<p align="center"><br>
<b>THE SCOPE OF LITERATURE</b><span lang="en-us"> </span></p>
<p>Literature is a form of human expression. But not everything expressed in 
words &#151; even when organized and written down &#151; is counted as literature. Those 
writings that are primarily informative &#151; technical, scholarly, journalistic &#151; 
would be excluded from the rank of literature by most, though not all, critics. 
Certain forms of writing, however, are universally regarded as belonging to 
literature as an art. Individual attempts within these forms are said to succeed 
if they possess something called artistic merit and to fail if they do not. The 
nature of artistic merit is less easy to define than to recognize. The writer 
need not even pursue it to attain it. On the contrary, a scientific exposition 
might be of great literary value and a pedestrian poem of none at all.</p>
<p>The purest (or, at least, the most intense) literary form is the lyric poem, 
and after it comes elegiac, epic, dramatic, narrative, and expository verse. 
Most theories of literary criticism base themselves on an analysis of poetry, 
because the aesthetic problems of literature are there presented in their 
simplest and purest form. Poetry that fails as literature is not called poetry 
at all but verse. Many novels &#151; certainly all the world&#146;s great novels &#151; are 
literature, but there are thousands that are not so considered. Most great 
dramas are considered literature (although the Chinese, possessors of one of the 
world&#146;s greatest dramatic traditions, consider their plays, with few exceptions, 
to possess no literary merit whatsoever).</p>
<p>The Greeks thought of history as one of the seven arts, inspired by a 
goddess, the muse Clio. All of the world&#146;s classic surveys of history can stand 
as noble examples of the art of literature, but most historical works and 
studies today are not written primarily with literary excellence in mind, though 
they may possess it, as it were, by accident.</p>
<p>The essay was once written deliberately as a piece of literature; its subject 
matter was of comparatively minor importance. Today most essays are written as 
expository, informative journalism, although there are still essayists in the 
great tradition who think of themselves as artists. Now, as in the past, some of 
the greatest essayists are critics of literature, drama, and the arts.</p>
<p>Some personal documents (autobiographies, diaries, memoirs, and letters) rank 
among the world&#146;s greatest literature. Some examples of this biographical 
literature were written with posterity in mind, others with no thought of their 
being read by anyone but the writer. Some are in a highly polished literary 
style; others, couched in a privately evolved language, win their standing as 
literature because of their cogency, insight, depth, and scope.</p>
<p>Many works of philosophy are classed as literature. The <i>Dialogues</i> of 
Plato (4th century BC) are written with great narrative skill and in the finest 
prose; the <i>Meditations</i> of the second-century Roman emperor Marcus 
Aurelius are a collection of apparently random thoughts, and the Greek in which 
they are written is eccentric. Yet both are classed as literature, while the 
speculations of other philosophers, ancient and modern, are not. Certain 
scientific works endure as literature long after their scientific content has 
become outdated. This is particularly true of books of natural history, where 
the element of personal observation is of special importance. An excellent 
example is Gilbert White&#146;s <i>Natural History and Antiquities of Selbourne</i> 
(1789).</p>
<p>Oratory, the art of persuasion, was long considered a great literary art. The 
oratory of the American Indian, for instance, is famous, while in classical 
Greece, Polymnia was the muse sacred to poetry and oratory. Rome&#146;s great orator 
Cicero was to have a decisive influence on the development of English prose 
style. Abraham Lincoln&#146;s Gettysburg Address is known to every American 
schoolchild. Today, however, oratory is more usually thought of as a craft than 
as an art. Most critics would not admit advertising copywriting, purely 
commercial fiction, or cinema and television scripts as accepted forms of 
literary expression, although others would hotly dispute their exclusion. The 
test in individual cases would seem to be one of enduring satisfaction and, of 
course, truth. Indeed, it becomes more and more difficult to categorize 
literature, for in modern civilization words are everywhere. Man is subject to a 
continuous flood of communication. Most of it is fugitive, but here and there &#151; 
in high-level journalism, in television, in the cinema, in commercial fiction, 
in westerns and detective stories, and in plain, expository prose &#151; some 
writing, almost by accident, achieves an aesthetic satisfaction, a depth and 
relevance that entitle it to stand with other examples of the art of literature.</p>
<p align="center"><b><br>
LITERARY COMPOSITION</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Critical theories.</span> If the early 
Egyptians or Sumerians had critical theories about the writing of literature, 
these have not survived. From the time of classical Greece until the present 
day, however, Western criticism has been dominated by two opposing theories of 
the literary art, which might conveniently be called the expressive and 
constructive theories of composition.</p>
<p>The Greek philosopher and scholar Aristotle (384-322 BC) is the first great 
representative of the constructive school of thought. His <i>Poetics</i> (the 
surviving fragment of which is limited to an analysis of tragedy and epic 
poetry) has sometimes been dismissed as a recipe book for the writing of 
potboilers. Certainly, Aristotle is primarily interested in the theoretical 
construction of tragedy, much as an architect might analyze the construction of 
a temple, but he is not exclusively objective and matter of fact. He does, 
however, regard the expressive elements in literature as of secondary 
importance, and the terms he uses to describe them have been open to 
interpretation and a matter of controversy ever since.</p>
<p>The first-century Greek treatise <i>On the Sublime</i> (conventionally 
attributed to the third-century Longinus) deals with the question left 
unanswered by Aristotle &#151; what makes great literature &#147;great&#148;? Its standards 
are almost entirely expressive. Where Aristotle is analytical and states general 
principles, the pseudo-Longinus is more specific and gives many quotations; even 
so, his critical theories are confined largely to impressionistic generalities.</p>
<p>Thus, at the beginning of Western literary criticism, the controversy already 
exists. Is the artist or writer a technician, like a cook or an engineer, who 
designs and constructs a sort of machine that will elicit an aesthetic response 
from his audience? Or is he a virtuoso who above all else expresses himself and, 
because he gives voice to the deepest realities of his own personality, 
generates a response from his readers because they admit some profound 
identification with him? This antithesis endures throughout Western European 
history &#151; Scholasticism versus Humanism, Classicism versus Romanticism, Cubism 
versus Expressionism &#151; and survives to this day in the common judgment of our 
contemporary artists and writers. It is surprising how few critics have declared 
that the antithesis is unreal, that a work of literary or plastic art is at once 
constructive and expressive, and that it must in fact be both.</p>
<p><b><i>Eastern.</i></b> Critical theories of literature in the Orient, however, have 
been more varied. There is an immense amount of highly technical, critical 
literature in India. Some works are recipe books, vast collections of tropes and 
stylistic devices; others are philosophical and general. In the best period of 
Indian literature, the cultural climax of Sanskrit (<i>c.</i> 320-490), it is 
assumed by writers that expressive and constructive factors are twin aspects of 
one reality. The same could be said of the Chinese, whose literary manuals and 
books on prosody and rhetoric are, as with the West, relegated to the class of 
technical handbooks, while their literary criticism is concerned rather with 
subjective, expressive factors &#151; and so aligns itself with the 
pseudo-Longinus&#146;s &#147;sublime.&#148; In Japan, technical, stylistic elements are 
certainly important (Japanese discrimination in these matters is perhaps the 
most refined in the world), but both writer and reader above all seek qualities 
of subtlety and poignancy and look for intimations of profundity often so 
evanescent as to escape entirely the uninitiated reader.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Broad and narrow conceptions of poetry.</span> 
Far Eastern literary tradition has raised the question of the broad and narrow 
definitions of poetry (a question familiar in the West from Edgar Allan Poe&#146;s 
advocacy of the short poem in his &#147;Poetic Principle&#148; [1850]). There are no 
long epic poems in Chinese, no verse novels of the sort written in England by 
Robert Browning or Alfred Lord Tennyson in the nineteenth century. In Chinese 
drama, apart from a very few of the songs, the verse as such is considered 
doggerel. The versified treatises on astronomy, agriculture, or fishing, of the 
sort written in Greek and Roman times and during the eighteenth century in the 
West, are almost unknown in the Far East. Chinese poetry is almost exclusively 
lyric, meditative, and elegiac, and rarely does any poem exceed 100 lines &#151; 
most are little longer than Western sonnets; many are only quatrains. In Japan 
this tendency to limit length was carried even further. The ballad survives in 
folk poetry, as it did in China, but the &#147;long poem&#148; of very moderate length 
disappeared early from literature. For the Japanese, the tanka is a &#147;long 
poem&#148;; in its common form it has 31 syllables; the <i>sedôka</i> has 38; the <i>
dodoitsu,</i> imitating folk song, has 26. From the seventeenth century and 
onward, the most popular poetic form was the haiku, which has only 17 syllables.</p>
<p>This development is relevant to the West because it spotlights the 
ever-increasing emphasis which has been laid on intensity of communication, a 
characteristic of Western poetry (and of literature generally) as it has evolved 
since the late nineteenth century. In the Far East all cultivated people were 
supposed to be able to write suitable occasional poetry, and so those qualities 
that distinguished a poem from the mass consequently came to be valued above all 
others. Similarly, as modern readers in the West struggle with a &#147;communication 
avalanche&#148; of words, they seek in literature those forms, ideas, values, 
vicarious experiences, and styles that transcend the verbiage to be had on every 
hand.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Literary language.</span> In some literatures 
(notably classical Chinese, Old Norse, Old Irish), the language employed is 
quite different from that spoken or used in ordinary writing. This marks off the 
reading of literature as a special experience. In the Western tradition, it is 
only in comparatively modern times that literature has been written in the 
common speech of cultivated men. The Elizabethans did not talk like Shakespeare 
nor eighteenth-century people in the stately prose of Samuel Johnson or Edward 
Gibbon (the so-called Augustan plain style in literature became popular in the 
late seventeenth century and flourished throughout the eighteenth, but it was 
really a special form of rhetoric with antecedent models in Greek and Latin). 
The first person to write major works of literature in the ordinary English 
language of the educated man was Daniel Defoe (1660?-1731), and it is remarkable 
how little the language has changed since. <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> (1719) is much 
more contemporary in tone than the elaborate prose of nineteenth-century writers 
like Thomas De Quincey or Walter Pater. (Defoe&#146;s language is not, in fact, so 
very simple; simplicity is itself one form of artifice.)</p>
<p><b><i>Ambiguity.</i></b> Other writers have sought to use language for its most 
subtle and complex effects and have deliberately cultivated the ambiguity 
inherent in the multiple or shaded meanings of words. Between the two world 
wars, &#147;ambiguity&#148; became very fashionable in English and American poetry and 
the ferreting out of ambiguities &#151; from even the simplest poem &#151; was a 
favorite critical sport. T.S. Eliot in his literary essays is usually considered 
the founder of this movement. Actually, the platform of his critical attitudes 
is largely moral, but his two disciples, I.A. Richards in <i>Principles of 
Literary Criticism</i> and William Empson in <i>Seven Types of Ambiguity,</i> 
carried his method to extreme lengths. The basic document of the movement is 
Charles Kay Ogden and I.A. Richards&#146;s <i>The Meaning of Meaning,</i> a work of 
enormous importance in its time. Only a generation later, however, their ideas 
were somewhat at a discount.</p>
<p><b><i>Translation.</i></b> Certainly, William Blake or Thomas Campion, when they 
were writing their simple lyrics, were unaware of the ambiguities and multiple 
meanings that future critics would find in them. Nevertheless, language is 
complex. Words do have overtones; they do stir up complicated reverberations in 
the mind that are ignored in their dictionary definitions. Great stylists, and 
most especially great poets, work with at least a half-conscious, or subliminal, 
awareness of the infinite potentialities of language. This is one reason why the 
essence of most poetry and great prose is so resistant to translation (quite 
apart from the radically different sound patterns that are created in 
other-language versions). The translator must project himself into the mind of 
the original author; he must transport himself into an entirely different world 
of relationships between sounds and meanings, and at the same time he must 
establish an equivalence between one infinitely complex system and another. 
Since no two languages are truly equivalent in anything except the simplest 
terms, this is a most difficult accomplishment. Certain writers are 
exceptionally difficult to translate. There are no satisfactory English 
versions, for example, of the Latin of Catullus, the French of Baudelaire, the 
Russian of Pushkin, or of the majority of Persian and Arabic poetry. The 
splendor of Sophocles&#146;s Greek, of Plato at his best, is barely suggested even 
in the finest English versions. On the other hand, the Germans insist that 
Shakespeare is better in German than he is in English, a humorous exaggeration 
perhaps. But again, Shakespeare is resistant to translation into French. His 
English seems to lack equivalents in that language.</p>
<p>The very greatest translations may become classics in their own right, of 
enduring literary excellence (the King James Version of the Bible, appearing in 
1611, is the outstanding example), but on the whole the approximate equivalence 
of most translations to their originals seems to have a very short life. The 
original work remains the same, of lasting value to its own people, but the 
translation becomes out of date with each succeeding generation as the language 
and criteria of literary taste change. Nothing demonstrates the complexity of 
literary language more vividly. An analogous process takes place when a reader 
experiences a literary work in his own language; each generation gets a &#147;new 
version&#148; from its own classics.</p>
<p>Yet the values of great literature are more fundamental than complexity and 
subtleties of meaning arising from language alone. Works far removed from 
contemporary man in time and in cultural background, composed in a variety of 
languages utterly different from one another in structure, have nevertheless 
been translated successfully enough to be deeply moving. The twentieth century 
has seen an immense mass of the oral literature of preliterate peoples and of 
the writings of all the great civilizations translated into modern languages. 
Understanding the growth of literature and its forms in other civilizations has 
greatly enriched the understanding of our own.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Craftsmanship.</span> <b> <i>Prosody.</i></b> 
Literature, like music, is an art of time, or &#147;tempo&#148;: it takes time to read 
or listen to, and it usually presents events or the development of ideas or the 
succession of images or all these together in time. The craft of literature, 
indeed, can be said to be in part the manipulation of a structure in time, and 
so the simplest element of marking time, rhythm, is therefore of basic 
importance in both poetry and prose. Prosody, which is the science of 
versification, has for its subject the materials of poetry and is concerned 
almost entirely with the laws of metre, or rhythm in the narrowest sense. It 
deals with the patterning of sound in time; the number, length, accent, and 
pitch of syllables; and the modifications of rhythm by vowels and consonants. In 
most poetry, certain basic rhythms are repeated with modifications (that is to 
say, the poem rhymes or scans or both) but not in all. It most obviously does 
neither in the case of the &#147;free forms&#148; of modern poetry; but neither does it 
in the entire poetry of whole cultures. Since lyric poetry is either the actual 
text of song or else is immediately derived from song, it is regular in 
structure nearly everywhere in the world, although the elements of patterning 
that go into producing its rhythm may vary. The most important of these elements 
in English poetry, for example, have been accent, grouping of syllables (called 
feet), number of syllables in the line, and rhyme at the end of a line (and 
sometimes within it). Other elements such as pitch, resonance, repetition of 
vowels (assonance), repetition of consonants (alliteration), and breath pauses 
(cadence) have also been of great importance in distinguishing successful poetry 
from doggerel verse, but on the whole they are not as important as the former, 
and poets have not always been fully conscious of their use of them. Greek and 
Latin poetry was consciously patterned on the length of syllables (long or 
short) rather than on their accent; but all the considerations of &#147;sound&#148; 
(such as assonance and alliteration) entered into the aesthetically satisfactory 
structure of a poem. Similarly, both the French and Japanese were content simply 
to count the syllables in a line &#151; but again, they also looked to all the 
&#147;sound&#148; elements.</p>
<p>The rhythms of prose are more complicated, though not necessarily more 
complex, than those of poetry. The rules of prose patterning are less fixed; 
patterns evolve and shift indefinitely and are seldom repeated except for 
special emphasis. So the analysis of prose rhythm is more difficult to make 
than, at least, the superficial analysis of poetry.</p>
<p><b><i>Structure.</i></b> The craft of writing involves more than mere rules of 
prosody. The work&#146;s structure must be manipulated to attract the reader. First, 
the literary situation has to be established. The reader must be directly 
related to the work, placed in it &#151; given enough information on who, what, 
when, or why &#151; so that his attention is caught and held (or, on the other hand, 
he must be deliberately mystified, to the same end).</p>
<p>Aristotle gave a formula for dramatic structure that can be generalized to 
apply to most literature: presentation, development, complication, crisis, and 
resolution. Even lyric poems can possess plot in this sense, but by no means are 
all literary works so structured, nor does such structure ensure their merit &#151; 
it can be safely said that westerns, detective stories, and cheap melodramas are 
more likely to follow strictly the rules of Aristotle&#146;s <i>Poetics</i> than are 
great novels. Nevertheless, the scheme does provide a norm from which there is 
infinite variation. Neoclassical dramatists and critics, especially in 
seventeenth-century France, derived from Aristotle what they called the unities 
of time, action, and place. This meant that the action of a play should not 
spread beyond the events of one day and, best of all, should be confined within 
the actual time of performance. Nor should the action move about too much from 
place to place &#151; best only to go from indoors to outdoors and back. There 
should be only one plot line, which might be relieved by a subplot, usually 
comic. These three unities &#151; of time, place, and action &#151; do not occur in 
Aristotle and are certainly not observed in Classical Greek tragedy. They are an 
invention of Renaissance critics, some of whom went even further, insisting also 
on what might be called a unity of mood. To this day there are those who, 
working on this principle, object to Shakespeare&#146;s use of comic relief within 
the tragic action of his plays &#151; to the porter in <i>Macbeth,</i> for instance, 
or the gravediggers in <i>Hamlet</i>.</p>
<p>Assiduous critics have found elaborate architectural structures in quite 
diffuse works &#151; including Miguel de Cervantes&#146;s <i>Don Quixote</i> (1605-1615), 
Sterne&#146;s <i>Tristram Shandy</i> (1759-1767), Casanova&#146;s <i>Icosameron</i> (1788; 
1928). But their &#147;discoveries&#148; are too often put there after the event. Great 
early novels such as the Chinese <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i> (1754; first 
published in English 1929) and the Japanese <i>Tale of Genji</i> (early eleventh 
century) usually develop organically rather than according to geometrical 
formulas, one incident or image spinning off another. Probably the most tightly 
structured work, in the Neoclassicists&#146; sense, is the Icelandic <i>Njal's Saga</i>.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century was the golden age of the novel, and most of the more 
famous examples of the form were systematically plotted, even where the plot 
structure simply traced the growth in personality of an individual hero or 
heroine. This kind of novel, of which in their very diverse ways Stendhal&#146;s <i>
The Red and the Black</i> (1830) and Dickens&#146;s <i>David Copperfield</i> (1850) 
are great examples, is known as <i>Bildungsroman</i>. Gustave Flaubert&#146;s <i>
Madame Bovary</i> (1857) is as rigorously classicist in form as the 
seventeenth-century plays of Racine and Corneille, which were the high point of 
the French classical theatre, although Flaubert obeys laws more complex than 
those of the Aristotelians. Novels such as Tolstoy&#146;s <i>War and Peace</i> 
(1865-1869), Dostoyevsky&#146;s <i>Brothers Karamazov</i> (1880), and the works of 
Balzac owe much of their power to their ability to overwhelm the reader with a 
massive sense of reality. The latter nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 
witnessed an attack on old forms, but what the new writers evolved was simply a 
new architecture. A novel like James Joyce&#146;s <i>Ulysses</i> (1922), which takes 
place in a day and an evening, is one of the most highly structured ever 
written. Novelists such as Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, Virginia Woolf, and, 
to a lesser extent, Henry James developed a multiple-aspect narrative, sometimes 
by using time shifts and flashbacks and by writing from different points of 
view, sometimes by using the device (dating back to Classical Greek romances) of 
having one or more narrators as characters within the story. (This technique, 
which was first perfected in the verse novels of Robert Browning, in fact 
reached its most extreme development in the English language in poetry: in Ezra 
Pound&#146;s <i>Cantos,</i> T.S. Eliot&#146;s <i>The Waste Land,</i> William Carlos 
Williams&#146;s <i>Paterson,</i> and the many long poems influenced by them.)</p>
<p align="center"><b><br>
CONTENT OF LITERATURE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">The word as symbol.</span> The content of 
literature is as limitless as the desire of human beings to communicate with one 
another. The thousands of years, perhaps hundreds of thousands, since the human 
species first developed speech have seen built up the almost infinite systems of 
relationships called languages. A language is not just a collection of words in 
an unabridged dictionary but the individual and social possession of living men, 
an inexhaustible system of equivalents, of sounds to objects and to one another. 
Its most primitive elements are those words that express direct experiences of 
objective reality, and its most sophisticated are concepts on a high level of 
abstraction. Words are not only equivalent to things, they have varying degrees 
of equivalence to one another. A symbol, says the dictionary, is something that 
stands for something else or a sign used to represent something, &#147;as the lion 
is the symbol of courage, the cross the symbol of Christianity.&#148; In this sense 
all words can be called symbols, but the examples given &#151; the lion and the 
cross &#151; are really metaphors: that is, symbols that represent a complex of 
other symbols, and which are generally negotiable in a given society (just as 
money is a symbol for goods or labor). Eventually a language comes to be, among 
other things, a huge sea of implicit metaphors, an endless web of interrelated 
symbols. As literature, especially poetry, grows more and more sophisticated, it 
begins to manipulate this field of suspended metaphors as a material in itself, 
often as an end in itself. Thus, there emerge forms of poetry (and prose, too) 
with endless ramifications of reference, as in Japanese waka and haiku, some 
ancient Irish and Norse verse, and much of the poetry written in western Europe 
since the time of Baudelaire that is called modernist. It might be supposed 
that, at its most extreme, this development would be objective, constructive &#151; 
aligning it with the critical theories stemming from Aristotle&#146;s <i>Poetics</i>. 
On the contrary, it is romantic, subjective art, primarily because the writer 
handles such material instinctively and subjectively, approaches it as the 
&#147;collective unconscious,&#148; to use the term of the psychologist Carl Jung, 
rather than with deliberate rationality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Themes and their sources.</span> By the time 
literature appears in the development of a culture, the society has already come 
to share a whole system of stereotypes and archetypes: major symbols standing 
for the fundamental realities of the human condition, including the kind of 
symbolic realities that are enshrined in religion and myth. Literature may use 
such symbols directly, but all great works of literary art are, as it were, 
original and unique myths. The world&#146;s great classics evoke and organize the 
archetypes of universal human experience. This does not mean, however, that all 
literature is an endless repetition of a few myths and motives, endlessly 
retelling the first stories of civilized man, repeating the Sumerian <i>Epic of 
Gilgamesh</i> or Sophocles&#146;s <i>Oedipus the King</i>. The subject matter of 
literature is as wide as human experience itself. Myths, legends, and folktales 
lie at the beginning of literature, and their plots, situations, and allegorical 
(metaphorical narrative) judgments of life represent a constant source of 
literary inspiration that never fails. This is so because mankind is constant &#151; 
men share a common physiology. Even social structures, after the development of 
cities, remain much alike. Whole civilizations have a life pattern that repeats 
itself through history. Jung&#146;s term &#147;collective unconscious&#148; really means that 
mankind is one species, with a common fund of general experience. Egyptian 
scribes, Soviet bureaucrats, and junior executives in New York City live and 
respond to life in the same ways; the lives of farmers or miners or hunters vary 
only within narrow limits. Love is love and death is death, for a South African 
Bushman and a French Surrealist alike. So the themes of literature have at once 
an infinite variety and an abiding constancy. They can be taken from myth, from 
history, or from contemporary occurrence, or they can be pure invention (but 
even if they are invented, they are nonetheless constructed from the constant 
materials of real experience, no matter how fantastic the invention).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">The writer&#146;s personal involvement.</span> As 
time goes on, literature tends to concern itself more and more with the interior 
meanings of its narrative, with problems of human personality and human 
relationships. Many novels are fictional, psychological biographies which tell 
of the slowly achieved integration of the hero&#146;s personality or of his 
disintegration, of the conflict between self-realization and the flow of events 
and the demands of other people. This can be presented explicitly, where the 
characters talk about what is going on in their heads; either ambiguously and 
with reserve, as in the novels of Henry James, or overtly, as in those of 
Dostoyevsky. Alternatively, it can be presented by a careful arrangement of 
objective facts, where psychological development is described purely in terms of 
behavior, and where the reader&#146;s subjective response is elicited by the minute 
descriptions of physical reality, as in the novels of Stendhal and the greatest 
Chinese novels like <i>The Dream of the Red Chamber,</i> which convince the 
reader that through the novel he is seeing reality itself rather than an 
artfully contrived semblance of reality.</p>
<p>Literature, however, is not solely concerned with the concrete, with 
objective reality, with individual psychology, or with subjective emotion. Some 
deal with abstract ideas or philosophical conceptions. Much purely abstract 
writing is considered literature only in the widest sense of the term, and the 
philosophical works that are ranked as great literature are usually presented 
with more or less of a sensuous garment. Thus, Plato&#146;s <i>Dialogues</i> rank as 
great literature because the philosophical material is presented in dramatic 
form, as the dialectical outcome of the interchange of ideas between clearly 
drawn, vital personalities, and because the descriptive passages are of great 
lyric beauty. Karl Marx&#146;s <i>Das Kapital</i> (1867-1895) approaches great 
literature in certain passages in which he expresses the social passion he 
shares with the Hebrew prophets of the Old Testament. Euclid&#146;s <i>Elements</i> 
and St. Thomas Aquinas&#146;s <i>Summa Theologica</i> give literary, aesthetic 
satisfaction to some people because of their purity of style and beauty of 
architectonic construction. In short, most philosophical works that rank as 
great literature do so because they are intensely human. The reader responds to 
Pascal&#146;s <i>Pensées,</i> to Montaigne&#146;s <i>Essays,</i> and to Marcus Aurelius&#146;s
<i>Meditations</i> as he would to living men. Sometimes the pretense of purely 
abstract intellectual rigor is in fact a literary device. The writings of the 
twentieth-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, for example, owed much of 
their impact to this approach, while the poetry of Paul Valéry borrows the 
language of philosophy and science for its rhetorical and evocative power.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Relation of form to content.</span> 
Throughout literary history, many great critics have pointed out that it is 
artificial to make a distinction between form and content, except for purposes 
of analytical discussion. Form determines content. Content determines form. The 
issue is, indeed, usually only raised at all by those critics who are more 
interested in politics, religion, or ideology than in literature; thus, they 
object to writers who they feel sacrifice ideological orthodoxy for formal 
perfection, message for style.</p>
<p><b><i>Style.</i></b> But style cannot really be said to exist on paper at all; it is 
the way the mind of the author expresses itself in words. Since words represent 
ideas, there cannot be abstract literature unless a collection of nonsense 
syllables can be admitted as literature. Even the most avant-garde writers 
associated with the Cubist or Non-Objective painters used language, and language 
is meaning, though the meaning may be incomprehensible. Oscar Wilde and Walter 
Pater, the great nineteenth-century exponents of &#147;art for art&#146;s sake,&#148; were in 
fact tireless propagandists for their views, which dominate their most flowery 
prose. It is true that great style depends on the perfect matching of content 
and form, so that the literary expression perfectly reflects the writer&#146;s 
intention; &#147;poor style&#148; reveals the inability of a writer to match the two &#151; 
in other words, reveals his inability to express himself. This is why we say 
that &#147;style expresses the man.&#148; The veiled style of Henry James, with its 
subtleties, equivocations, and qualifications, perfectly reflects his 
complicated and subtle mind and his abiding awareness of ambiguity in human 
motives. At the other extreme, the style of Theodore Dreiser &#151; bumbling, 
clumsy, dogged, troubled &#151; perfectly embodies his own attitudes toward life and 
is, in fact, his constant judgment of his subject matter. Sometimes an author, 
under the impression that he is simply polishing his style, may completely alter 
his content. As Flaubert worked over the drafts of <i>Madame Bovary,</i> seeking 
always the apposite word that would precisely convey his meaning, he lifted his 
novel from a level of sentimental romance to make it one of the great ironic 
tragedies of literature. Yet, to judge from his correspondence, he seems never 
to have been completely aware of what he had done, of the severity of his own 
irony.</p>
<p>Literature may be an art, but writing is a craft, and a craft must be 
learned. Talent, special ability in the arts, may appear at an early age; the 
special personality called genius may indeed be born, not made. But skill in 
matching intention and expression comes with practice. Naïve writers, 
&#147;naturals&#148; like the seventeenth-century English diarist Samuel Pepys, the late 
eighteenth-century French naïf Restif de la Bretonne, the twentieth-century 
American novelist Henry Miller, are all deservedly called stylists, although 
their styles are far removed from the deliberate, painstaking practice of a 
Flaubert or a Turgenev. They wrote spontaneously whatever came into their heads; 
but they wrote constantly, voluminously, and were, by their own standards, 
skilled practitioners.</p>
<p><b><i>Objective-subjective expression.</i></b> There are certain forms of literature 
that do not permit such highly personal behavior &#151; for instance, formal lyric 
poetry and classic drama. In these cases the word &#147;form&#148; is used to mean a 
predetermined structure within whose mold the content must be fitted. These 
structures are, however, quite simple and so cannot be said to determine the 
content. Racine and Corneille were contemporaries; both were Neoclassic French 
dramatists; both abided by all the artificial rules &#151; usually observing the 
&#147;unities&#148; and following the same strict rules of prosody. Yet their plays, and 
the poetry in which they are written, differ completely. Corneille is 
intellectually and emotionally a Neoclassicist &#151; clear and hard, a true 
objectivist, sure of both his verse and the motivations of his characters. 
Racine was a great romantic long before the age of Romanticism. His characters 
are confused and tortured; his verse throbs like the heartbeats of his desperate 
heroines. He is a great sentimentalist in the best and deepest meaning of that 
word. His later influence on poets like Baudelaire and Paul Valéry is due to his 
mastery of sentimental expression, not, as they supposed, to his mastery of 
Neoclassic form.</p>
<p>Verse on any subject matter can of course be written purely according to 
formula. The eighteenth century in England saw all sorts of prose treatises cast 
in rhyme and metre, but this was simply applied patterning. (Works such as <i>
The Botanic Garden</i> [1794-1795] by Erasmus Darwin should be sharply 
distinguished from James Thomson&#146;s <i>The Seasons</i> [1726-1730], which is true 
poetry, not versified natural history &#151; just as Virgil&#146;s <i>Georgics</i> is not 
an agricultural handbook.) Neoclassicism, especially in its eighteenth-century 
developments, confused &#151; for ordinary minds, at any rate &#151; formula with form 
and so led to the revolt called Romanticism. The leading theorists of that 
revolt, William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in the &#147;Preface&#148; 
(1800) to <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> urged the observance of a few simple rules 
basic to all great poetry and demanded a return to the integrity of expressive 
form. A similar revolution in taste was taking place all over Europe and also in 
China (where the narrow pursuit of formula had almost destroyed poetry). The 
Romantic taste could enjoy the &#147;formlessness&#148; of William Blake&#146;s prophetic 
books, or Walt Whitman&#146;s <i>Leaves of Grass,</i> or the loose imagination of 
Shelley &#151; but careful study reveals that these writers were not formless at 
all. Each had his own personal form.</p>
<p>Time passes and the pendulum of taste swings. In the mid-twentieth century, 
Paul Valéry, T.S. Eliot, and Yvor Winters would attack what the latter called 
&#147;the fallacy of expressive form,&#148; but this is itself a fallacy. All form in 
literature is expressive. All expression has its own form, even when the form is 
a deliberate quest of formlessness. (The automatic writing cultivated by the 
Surrealists, for instance, suffers from the excessive formalism of the 
unconscious mind and is far more stereotyped than the poetry of the 
Neoclassicist Alexander Pope.) Form simply refers to organization, and critics 
who attack form do not seem always to remember that a writer organizes more than 
words. He organizes experience. Thus, his organization stretches far back in his 
mental process. Form is the other face of content, the outward, visible sign of 
inner spiritual reality.</p>
<p align="center"><b><br>
LITERATURE AND ITS AUDIENCE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Folk and elite literature.</span> In 
preliterate societies oral literature was widely shared; it saturated the 
society and was as much a part of living as food, clothing, shelter, or 
religion. In barbaric societies, the minstrel might be a courtier of the king or 
chieftain, and the poet who composed liturgies might be a priest. But the oral 
performance itself was accessible to the whole community. As society evolved its 
various social layers, or classes, an &#147;elite&#148; literature began to be 
distinguishable from the &#147;folk&#148; literature of the people. With the invention 
of writing this separation was accelerated until finally literature was being 
experienced individually by the elite (reading a book), while folklore and folk 
song were experienced orally and more or less collectively by the illiterate 
common people.</p>
<p>Elite literature continuously refreshes itself with materials drawn from the 
popular. Almost all poetic revivals, for instance, include in their programs a 
new appreciation of folk song, together with a demand for greater objectivity. 
On the other hand folk literature borrows themes and, very rarely, patterns from 
elite literature. Many of the English and Scottish ballads that date from the 
end of the Middle Ages and have been preserved by oral tradition share plots and 
even turns of phrase with written literature. A very large percentage of these 
ballads contain elements that are common to folk ballads from all over western 
Europe; central themes of folklore, indeed, are found all over the world. 
Whether these common elements are the result of diffusion is a matter for 
dispute. They do, however, represent great psychological constants, archetypes 
of experience common to the human species, and so these constants are used again 
and again by elite literature as it discovers them in folklore.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Modern popular literature.</span> There is a 
marked difference between true popular literature, that of folklore and folk 
song, and the popular literature of modern times. Popular literature today is 
produced either to be read by a literate audience or to be enacted on television 
or in the cinema; it is produced by writers who are members, however lowly, of 
an elite corps of professional literates. Thus, popular literature no longer 
springs from the people; it is handed to them. Their role is passive. At the 
best they are permitted a limited selectivity as consumers.</p>
<p>Certain theorists once believed that folk songs and even long, narrative 
ballads were produced collectively, as has been said in mockery &#147;by the tribe 
sitting around the fire and grunting in unison.&#148; This idea is very much out of 
date. Folk songs and folk tales began somewhere in one human mind. They were 
developed and shaped into the forms in which they are now found by hundreds of 
other minds as they were passed down through the centuries. Only in this sense 
were they &#147;collectively&#148; produced. During the twentieth century, folklore and 
folk speech have had a great influence on elite literature &#151; on writers as 
different as Franz Kafka and Carl Sandburg, Selma Lagerlöf and Kawabata 
Yasunari, Martin Buber and Isaac Bashevis Singer. Folk song has always been 
popular with bohemian intellectuals, especially political radicals (who 
certainly are an elite). Since World War II the influence of folk song upon 
popular song has not just been great; it has been determinative. Almost all 
&#147;hit&#148; songs since the mid-century have been imitation folk songs; and some 
authentic folk singers attract immense audiences.</p>
<p>Popular fiction and drama, westerns and detective stories, films and 
television serials, all deal with the same great archetypal themes as folktales 
and ballads, though this is seldom due to direct influence; these are simply the 
limits within which the human mind works. The number of people who have elevated 
the formulas of popular fiction to a higher literary level is surprisingly 
small. Examples are H.G. Wells&#146;s early science fiction, the western stories of 
Gordon Young and Ernest Haycox, the detective stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 
Georges Simenon, and Raymond Chandler.</p>
<p>The latter half of the twentieth century has seen an even greater change in 
popular literature. Writing is a static medium: that is to say, a book is read 
by one person at a time; it permits recollection and anticipation; the reader 
can go back to check a point or move ahead to find out how the story ends. In 
radio, television, and the cinema the medium is fluent; the audience is a 
collectivity and is at the mercy of time. It cannot pause to reflect or to 
understand more fully without missing another part of the action, nor can it go 
back or forward. Marshall McLuhan in his book <i>Understanding Media</i> (1964) 
became famous for erecting a whole structure of aesthetic, sociological, and 
philosophical theory upon this fact. But it remains to be seen whether the new, 
fluent materials of communication are going to make so very many changes in 
civilization, let alone in the human mind &#151; mankind has, after all, been 
influenced for thousands of years by the popular, fluent arts of music and 
drama. Even the most transitory television serial was written down before it was 
performed, and the script can be consulted in the files. Before the invention of 
writing, all literature was fluent because it was contained in people&#146;s memory. 
In a sense it was more fluent than music, because it was harder to remember. Man 
in mass society becomes increasingly a creature of the moment, but the reasons 
for this are undoubtedly more fundamental than his forms of entertainment.</p>
<p align="center"><b><br>
LITERATURE AND ITS ENVIRONMENT</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Social and economic conditions.</span> 
Literature, like all other human activities, necessarily reflects current social 
and economic conditions. Class stratification was reflected in literature as 
soon as it had appeared in life. Among the American Indians, for instance, the 
chants of the shaman, or medicine man, differ from the secret, personal songs of 
the individual, and these likewise differ from the group songs of ritual or 
entertainment sung in community. In the Heroic Age, the epic tales of kings and 
chiefs that were sung or told in their barbaric courts differed from the 
folktales that were told in peasant cottages.</p>
<p>The more cohesive a society, the more the elements &#151; and even attitudes &#151; 
evolved in the different class strata are interchangeable at all levels. In the 
tight clan organization that existed in late medieval times at the Scottish 
border, for example, heroic ballads telling of the deeds of lords and ladies 
were preserved in the songs of the common people. But where class divisions are 
unbridgeable, elite literature is liable to be totally separated from popular 
culture. An extreme example is the classic literature of the Roman Empire. Its 
forms and its sources were largely Greek &#151; it even adopted its laws of verse 
patterning from Greek models, even though these were antagonistic to the natural 
patterns of the Latin language &#151; and most of the sophisticated works of the 
major Latin authors were completely closed to the overwhelming majority of 
people of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Printing has made all the difference in the negotiability of ideas. The 
writings of the eighteenth-century French writers Voltaire, Rousseau, and 
Diderot were produced from and for almost as narrow a caste as the Roman elite, 
but they were printed. Within a generation they had penetrated the entire 
society and were of vital importance in revolutionizing it.</p>
<p>Class distinctions in the literature of modern times exist more in the works 
themselves than in their audience. Although Henry James wrote about the upper 
classes and Émile Zola about workingmen, both were, in fact, members of an elite 
and were read by members of an elite &#151; moreover, in their day, those who read 
Zola certainly considered themselves more of an elite than did the readers of 
Henry James. The ordinary people, if they read at all, preferred sentimental 
romances and &#147;penny dreadfuls.&#148; Popular literature had already become 
commercially produced entertainment literature, a type which today is also 
provided by television scripts.</p>
<p>The elite who read serious literature are not necessarily members of a social 
or economic upper class. It has been said of the most ethereal French poet, 
Stéphane Mallarmé, that in every French small town there was a youth who carried 
his poems in his heart. These poems are perhaps the most &#147;elite&#148; product of 
western European civilization, but the &#147;youths&#148; referred to were hardly the 
sons of dukes or millionaires. (It is a curious phenomenon that, since the 
middle of the eighteenth century in Europe and in the United States, the 
majority of readers of serious literature &#151; as well as of entertainment 
literature &#151; have been women. The extent of the influence that this audience 
has exerted on literature itself must be immense.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">National and group literature.</span> 
Hippolyte Taine, the nineteenth-century French critic, evolved an ecological 
theory of literature. He looked first and foremost to the national 
characteristics of western European literatures, and he found the source of 
these characteristics in the climate and soil of each respective nation. His <i>
History of English Literature</i> (5 vols., 1863-1869) is an extensive 
elaboration of these ideas. It is doubtful that anyone today would agree with 
the simplistic terms in which Taine states his thesis. It is obvious that 
Russian literature differs from English or French from German. English books are 
written by Englishmen, their scenes are commonly laid in England, they are 
usually about Englishmen and they are designed to be read by Englishmen &#151; at 
least in the first instance. But modern civilization becomes more and more a 
world civilization, wherein works of all peoples flow into a general fund of 
literature. It is not unusual to read a novel by a Japanese author one week and 
one by a black writer from West Africa the next. Writers are themselves affected 
by this cross-fertilization. Certainly, the work of the great nineteenth-century 
Russian novelists has had more influence on twentieth-century American writers 
than has the work of their own literary ancestors. Poetry does not circulate so 
readily, because catching its true significance in translation is so very 
difficult to accomplish. Nevertheless, for the past hundred years or so, the 
influence of French poetry upon all the literatures of the civilized world has 
not just been important, it has been preeminent. The tendentious elements of 
literature &#151; propaganda for race, nation, or religion &#151; have been more and 
more eroded in this process of wholesale cultural exchange.</p>
<p>Popular literature on the other hand is habitually tendentious both 
deliberately and unconsciously. It reflects and stimulates the prejudices and 
parochialism of its audience. Most of the literary conflicts that have seized 
the totalitarian countries during the twentieth century stem directly from 
relentless efforts by the state to reduce elite literature to the level of the 
popular. The great proletarian novels of our time have been produced, not by 
Russians, but by American Negroes, Japanese, Germans, and &#151; most proletarian of 
all &#151; a German-American living in Mexico, B. Traven. Government control and 
censorship can inhibit literary development, perhaps deform it a little, and can 
destroy authors outright; but, whether in the France of Louis XIV or in the 
Soviet Union of the twentieth century, it cannot be said to have a fundamental 
effect upon the course of literature.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">The writer&#146;s position in society.</span> A 
distinguishing characteristic of modern literature is the peculiar elite which 
it has itself evolved. In earlier cultures the artist, though he may have been 
neurotic at times, thought of himself as part of his society and shared its 
values and attitudes. Usually the clerkly caste played a personal, important 
role in society. In the modern industrial civilization, however, &#147;scribes&#148; 
became simply a category of skilled hired hands. The writer shared few of the 
values of the merchant or the entrepreneur or manager. And so the literary and 
artistic world came to have a subculture of its own. The antagonism between the 
two resultant sets of values is the source of what we call alienation &#151; among 
the intellectuals at least (the alienation of the common man in urban, 
industrial civilization from his work, from himself, and from his fellows is 
another matter, although its results are reflected and intensified in the 
alienation of the elite). For about 200 years now, the artistic environment of 
the writer has not usually been shared with the general populace. The subculture 
known as bohemia and the literary and artistic movements generated in its little 
special society have often been more important &#151; at least in the minds of many 
writers &#151; than the historical, social, and economic movements of the culture as 
a whole. Even massive historical change is translated into these terms &#151; the 
Russian Revolution, for instance, into Communist-Futurism, Constructivism, 
Socialist Realism. Western European literature could be viewed as a parade of 
movements &#151; Romanticism, Realism, Naturalism, Futurism, Structuralism, and so 
on indefinitely. Some of the more journalistic critics, indeed, have delighted 
to regard it in such a way. But after the manifestos have been swept away, the 
meetings adjourned, the literary cafés of the moment lost their popularity, the 
turmoil is seen not to have made so very much difference. The Romantic Théophile 
Gautier (1811-1872) and the Naturalist Émile Zola (1840-1902) have more in 
common than they have differences, and their differences are rather because of 
changes in society as a whole than because of conflicting literary principles.</p>
<p>At first, changes in literary values are appreciated only at the upper levels 
of the literary elite itself, but often, within a generation, works once thought 
esoteric are being taught as part of a school syllabus. Most cultivated people 
once thought James Joyce&#146;s <i>Ulysses</i> incomprehensible or, where it was not, 
obscene. Today his methods and subject matter are commonplace in the commercial 
fiction of the mass culture. A few writers remain confined to the elite. 
Mallarmé is a good example &#151; but he would have been just as ethereal had he 
written in the simplest French of direct communication. His subtleties are 
ultimately grounded in his personality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Literature and the other arts.</span> 
Literature has an obvious kinship with the other arts. Presented, a play is 
drama; read, a play is literature. Most important films have been based upon 
written literature, usually novels, although all the great epics and most of the 
great plays have been filmed at some time and thus have stimulated the younger 
medium&#146;s growth. Conversely, the techniques required in writing for film have 
influenced many writers in structuring their novels and have affected their 
style. Most popular fiction is written with &#147;movie rights&#148; in mind, and these 
are certainly a consideration with most modern publishers. Literature provides 
the libretto for operas, the theme for tone poems &#151; even so anomalous a form as 
Nietzsche&#146;s <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> was interpreted in music by Richard 
Strauss &#151; and of course it provides the lyrics of songs. Many ballets and 
modern dances are based on stories or poems. Sometimes, music and dance are 
accompanied by a text read by a speaker or chanted by a chorus. The 
mid-nineteenth century was the heyday of literary, historical, and anecdotal 
painting, though, aside from the Surrealists, this sort of thing died out in the 
twentieth century. Cross-fertilization of literature and the arts now takes 
place more subtly, mostly in the use of parallel techniques &#151; the rational 
dissociation of the Cubists or the spontaneous action painting of the Abstract 
Expressionists, for example, which flourished at the same time as the 
free-flowing uncorrected narratives of some novelists in the l950s and &#146;60s.</p>
<p align="center"><b><br>
LITERARY GENRES</b></p>
<p>Critics have invented a variety of systems for treating literature as a 
collection of genres. Often these genres are artificial, invented after the fact 
with the aim of making literature less sprawling, more tidy. Theories of 
literature must be based upon direct experience of the living texts and so be 
flexible enough to contain their individuality and variety. Perhaps the best 
approach is historical, or genetic. What actually happened, and in what way did 
literature evolve up to the present day?</p>
<p>There is a surprising variety of oral literature among surviving preliterate 
peoples, and, as the written word emerges in history, the indications are that 
the important literary genres all existed at the beginning of civilized 
societies: heroic epic; songs in praise of priests and kings; stories of mystery 
and the supernatural; love lyrics; personal songs (the result of intense 
meditation); love stories; tales of adventure and heroism (of common peoples, as 
distinct from the heroic epics of the upper classes); satire (which was dreaded 
by barbaric chieftains); satirical combats (in which two poets or two 
personifications abused one another and praised themselves); ballads and 
folktales of tragedy and murder; folk stories, such as the tale of the clever 
boy who performs impossible tasks, outwits all his adversaries, and usually wins 
the hand of the king&#146;s daughter; animal fables like those attributed to Aesop 
(the special delight of Black Africa and Indian America); riddles, proverbs, and 
philosophical observations; hymns, incantations, and mysterious songs of 
priests; and finally actual mythology &#151; stories of the origin of the world and 
the human race, of the great dead, and of the gods and demigods.</p>
<p><b><i>Epic.</i></b> The true heroic epic never evolved far from its preliterate 
origins, and it arose only in the Heroic Age which preceded a settled 
civilization. The conditions reflected in, say, the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> 
are much the same as those of the Anglo-Saxon <i>Beowulf,</i> the German <i>
Nibelungenlied,</i> or the Irish stories of Cuchulainn. The literary epic is 
another matter altogether. Virgil&#146;s <i>Aeneid,</i> for instance, or Milton&#146;s <i>
Paradise Lost</i> are products of highly sophisticated literary cultures. Many 
long poems sometimes classified as epic literature are no such thing &#151; Dante&#146;s
<i>La divina Commedia,</i> for example, is a long theological, philosophical, 
political, moral, and mystical poem. Dante considered it to be a kind of drama 
which obeyed the rules of Aristotle&#146;s <i>Poetics</i>. Goethe&#146;s <i>Faust</i> is 
in dramatic form and is sometimes even staged &#151; but it is really a 
philosophical poetic novel. Modern critics have described long poems such as 
T.S. Eliot&#146;s <i>Waste Land</i> and Ezra Pound&#146;s <i>Cantos</i> as &#147;philosophical 
epics.&#148; There is nothing epic about them; they are reveries, more or less 
philosophical.</p>
<p><b><i>Lyric poetry.</i></b> Lyric poetry never gets far from its origins, except 
that some of its finest examples &#151; Medieval Latin, Provençal, Middle High 
German, Middle French, Renaissance &#151; which today are only read, were actually 
written to be sung. In the twentieth century, however, popular songs of great 
literary merit have become increasingly common &#151; for example, the songs of 
Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill in German, of Georges Brassens and Anne Sylvestre 
in French, and of Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, and Joni Mitchell. It is interesting 
to note that, in periods when the culture values artificiality, the lyric 
becomes stereotyped. Then, after a while, the poets revolt and, usually turning 
to folk origins, restore to lyric poetry at least the appearance of naturalness 
and spontaneity.</p>
<p><b><i>Satire.</i></b> The forms of satire are as manifold as those of literature 
itself &#151; from those of the mock epic to the biting epigram. A great many social 
and political novels of today would have been regarded as satire by the 
ancients. Many of the great works of all time are satires, but in each case they 
have risen far above their immediate satirical objectives. The sixteenth-century 
medieval satire on civilization, the <i>Gargantua and Pantagruel</i> of 
Rabelais, grew under the hand of its author into a great archetypal myth of the 
lust for life. Cervantes&#146;s <i>Don Quixote,</i> often called the greatest work of 
prose fiction in the West, is superficially a satire of the sentimental romance 
of knightly adventure. But, again, it is an archetypal myth, telling the 
adventures of the soul of man &#151; of the individual &#151; in the long struggle with 
what is called the human condition. <i>The Tale of Genji</i> by Murasaki Shikibu 
has sometimes been considered by obtuse critics as no more than a satire on the 
sexual promiscuity of the Heian court. In fact, it is a profoundly 
philosophical, religious, and mystical novel.</p>
<p><b><i>Prose fiction.</i></b> Extended prose fiction is the latest of the literary 
forms to develop. We have romances from classical Greek times that are as long 
as short novels; but they are really tales of adventure &#151; vastly extended 
anecdotes. The first prose fiction of any psychological depth is the <i>
Satyricon,</i> attributed to Petronius Arbiter (died AD 65/66). Though it 
survives only in fragments, supposedly one-eleventh of the whole, even these 
would indicate that it is one of the greatest picaresque novels, composed of 
loosely connected episodes of robust and often erotic adventure. The other great 
surviving fiction of classical times is the <i>Metamorphoses</i> (known as <i>
The Golden Ass</i>) by Apuleius (2nd century AD). In addition to being a 
picaresque adventure story, it is a criticism of Roman society, a celebration of 
the religion of Isis, and an allegory of the progress of the soul. It contains 
the justly celebrated story of Cupid and Psyche, a myth retold with 
psychological subtlety. Style has much to do with the value and hence the 
survival of these two works. They are written in prose of extraordinary beauty, 
although it is by no means of &#147;classical&#148; purity. The prose romances of the 
Middle Ages are closely related to earlier heroic literature. Some, like Sir 
Thomas Malory&#146;s fifteenth-century <i>Le Morte d&#146;Arthur,</i> are retellings of 
heroic legend in terms of the romantic chivalry of the early Renaissance, a 
combination of barbaric, medieval, and Renaissance sensibility which, in the 
tales of Tristram and Isolt and Lancelot and Guinevere, produced something not 
unlike modern novels of tragic love.</p>
<p>The Western novel is a product of modern civilization, although in the Far 
East novels began a separate development as early as the tenth century. Extended 
prose works of complex interpersonal relations and motivations begin in 
seventeenth-century France with <i>The Princess of Clèves</i> (1678) by Madame 
de Lafayette. Eighteenth-century France produced an immense number of novels 
dealing with love analysis but none to compare with Madame de Lafayette&#146;s until 
Pierre Choderlos de Laclos wrote <i>Les Liaisons dangereuses</i> (1782). This 
was, in form, an exchange of letters between two corrupters of youth; but, in 
intent, it was a savage satire of the ancient regime and a heart-rending 
psychological study. The English novel of the eighteenth century was less 
subtle, more robust &#151; vulgar in the best sense &#151; and is exemplified by Henry 
Fielding&#146;s <i>Tom Jones</i> (1749) and Laurence Sterne&#146;s <i>Tristram Shandy</i>. 
The nineteenth century was the golden age of the novel. It became ever more 
profound, complex, and subtle (or, on the other hand, more popular, eventful, 
and sentimental). By the beginning of the twentieth century it had become the 
most common form of thoughtful reading matter and had replaced, for most 
educated people, religious, philosophical, and scientific works as a medium for 
the interpretation of life. By the late 1920s the novel had begun to show signs 
of decay as a form, and no works have since been produced to compare with the 
recent past. This may prove to be a temporarily barren period, or else the novel 
may be losing its energy as a narrative art form and in this sense giving way to 
the medium of film.</p>
<p><b><i>Drama.</i></b> Like lyric poetry, drama has been an exceptionally stable 
literary form. Given a little leeway, most plays written by the beginning of the 
twentieth century could be adjusted to the rules of Aristotle&#146;s <i>Poetics</i>. 
Before World War I, however, all traditional art forms, led by painting, began 
to disintegrate, and new forms evolved to take their place. In drama the most 
radical innovator was August Strindberg (1849-1912), and from that day to this, 
drama (forced to compete with the cinema) has become ever more experimental, 
constantly striving for new methods, materials, and, especially, ways to 
establish a close relationship with the audience. All this activity has 
profoundly modified drama as literature.</p>
<p><b><i>Future developments.</i></b> In the twentieth century the methods of poetry 
have also changed drastically, although the &#147;innovator&#148; here might be said to 
have been Baudelaire (1821-1867). The disassociation and recombination of ideas 
of the Cubists, the free association of ideas of the Surrealists, dreams, trance 
states, the poetry of preliterate people &#151; all have been absorbed into the 
practice of modern poetry. This proliferation of form is not likely to end. 
Effort that once was applied to perfecting a single pattern in a single form may 
in the future be more and more directed toward the elaboration of entirely new 
&#147;multimedia&#148; forms, employing the resources of all the established arts. At 
the same time, writers may prefer to simplify and polish the forms of the past 
with a rigorous, Neoclassicist discipline. In a worldwide urban civilization, 
which has taken to itself the styles and discoveries of all cultures past and 
present, the future of literature is quite impossible to determine.</p>

WRITINGS ON LITERATURE</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: bold">Scholarly research.</span> </i>Research by 
scholars into the literary past began almost as soon as literature itself &#151; as 
soon as the documents accumulated &#151; and for many centuries it represents almost 
all the scholarship that has survived. The most extensive text of the Sumerian
<i>Epic of Gilgamesh,</i> the first of the world&#146;s great classics, is a late 
Assyrian synthesis that must have required an immense amount of research into 
clay tablets, written in several languages going back to the beginning of 
Mesopotamian civilization. Many Egyptian poems and the philosophic creation myth 
known as the &#147;Memphite Theology&#148; survive in very late texts that carefully 
reproduce the original language of the first dynasties. Once the function of the 
scribe was established as essential, he invented literary scholarship, both to 
secure his position and to occupy his leisure. The great epoch of literary 
scholarship in ancient times centered on the library (and university) of 
Alexandria from its foundation in 324 BC to its destruction by the Arabs in AD 
640. Hellenistic Greek scholars there developed such an academic and pedantic 
approach to literary scholarship and scholarly literature that the term 
Alexandrine remains pejorative to this day. To them, however, is owed the 
survival of the texts of most of the Greek classics. Roman literary scholarship 
was rhetorical rather than analytic. With the coming of Islam, there was 
established across the whole warm temperate zone of the Old World a far-flung 
community of scholars who were at home in learned circles from India to Spain. 
Judaism, like Islam, was a religion of the book and of written tradition, so 
literary scholarship played a central role in each. The same is true of India, 
China, and later Japan; for sheer bulk, as well as for subtlety and insight, 
Oriental scholarship has never been surpassed. In a sense, the Renaissance in 
Europe was a cultural revolution led by literary scholars who discovered, 
revived, and made relevant again the literary heritage of Greece and Rome. In 
the nineteenth century, literary scholarship was dominated by the exhaustive, 
painstaking German academician, and that Germanic tradition passed to the 
universities of the United States. The demand that every teacher should write a 
master&#146;s thesis, a doctor&#146;s dissertation, and, for the rest of his career, 
publish with reasonable frequency learned articles and scholarly books, has led 
to a mass of scholarship of widely varying standards and value. Some is trivial 
and absurd, but the best has perfected the texts and thoroughly illuminated the 
significance of nearly all the world&#146;s great literature.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style:italic">Literary criticism.</span> Literary 
criticism, as distinguished from scholarly research, is usually itself 
considered a form of literature. Some people find great critics as entertaining 
and stimulating as great poets, and theoretical treatises of literary aesthetics 
can be as exciting as novels. Aristotle, Longinus, and the Roman rhetorician and 
critic Quintilian are still read, although Renaissance critics like the once 
all-powerful Josephus Scaliger are forgotten by all but specialized scholars. 
Later critics, such as Poe, Sainte-Beuve, Taine, Vissarion Belinsky, Matthew 
Arnold, Walter Bagehot, Walter Pater, and George Saintsbury, are probably read 
more for themselves than for their literary judgments and for their general 
theorizing rather than for their applications (in the case of the first three, 
for instance, time has confounded almost all the evaluations they made of their 
contemporaries). The English critics have survived because they largely confined 
themselves to acknowledged masterpieces and general ideas. Perhaps literary 
criticism can really be read as a form of autobiography. Aestheticians of 
literature like I.A. Richards, Sir C.M. Bowra, Paul Valéry, Suzanne Langer, and 
Ernst Cassirer have had an influence beyond the narrow confines of literary 
scholarship and have played in our time something approaching the role of 
general philosophers. This has been true on the popular level as well. The Dane 
Georg Brandes, the Americans James Gibbons Huneker, H.L. Mencken, and Edmund 
Wilson &#151; these men have been social forces in their day. Literary criticism can 
play its role in social change. In Japan, the overthrow of the shogunate, the 
restoration of the emperor, and the profound change in the Japanese social 
sensibility begins with the literary criticism of Moto-ori Norinaga (1730-1801). 
The nineteenth-century revolution in theology resulted from the convergence of 
Darwinian theories of evolution and the technical and historical criticism of 
the Bible that scholars had undertaken. For many modern intellectuals, the 
literary quarterlies and weeklies, with their tireless discussions of the 
spiritual significance and formal characteristics of everything from the 
greatest masterpiece to the most ephemeral current production, can be said to 
have filled the place of religion, both as rite and dogma.</p>
