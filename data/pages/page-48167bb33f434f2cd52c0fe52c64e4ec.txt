This article by James J. Flink looks at the impact of the automobile technique on the
many facets of society.  The invention of the automobile was one technique that had
a tremendous impact on society as a whole and changed the inner workings of the
social machine forever. <p>

<p>

The auto had profound effects on the economical, social, moral, as well as
environmental aspects of society.<p>

<p>

<i><u>Economic</i></u><p>

	The economic impact not only would affect the manufacturers and the buyers of
autos, but the employment factor and the banking systems.  The family budget was
change, priorities changed.  Families suddenly felt that autos were a necessary for
everyday living(in part due to media) and needed to be obtained even sacrificing
other life needs.  <p>

<p>

Cars were expensive for the times and families were having a hard time coming up
with the resources to afford cars.  Manufacturers wanted to make money so they
collaborated with bankers and factions of society that held capital to find a way to
sell more autos--thus the birth of installment payments or credit.  The banking
institutions would lend families money to afford cars from the manufacturers, of
course at a profit.  The credit business had only just begun.  The thinking shifted
from "honest day's work for honest day's pay", to pay for needs and wants, to
"work till you're tired, then charge what you want and need".<p>

<p>

<i><u>Social<p>

</i></u>	The social structure was also rocked by the popularity of the auto.  They way in
which families lived, worked, and played was altered.  The community was
impacted--the auto allow individuals to escape the pressure of conformity or
prejudice and start life elsewhere(The very stuff societies are made of).  Family talks
after supper were replaced by family drives.  Instead of living in close proximity to
their places of employment, with the auto, families could move out of the smoke-filled cities to their own little "paradise" away from the big city.  Consequently,
socialization that revolved around the workplace took a different turn.  <p>

<p>

There was significant impact upon the SEC of America with the coming of the auto. 
The sale of new shiny autos posed a new issue:  What do we do all these used cars
when we persuade families to buy new cars and upgrade their previous models?  So,
a new industry evolved:   <i>Used Car Sales</i> or what we today called <i>Previously Owned</i>.<p>

Who would buy these cars?  Well, families that couldn't  afford new cars and were
at the lower end of the SEC ladder could be consumers.  The families with the
means to move out of the cities did so, leaving the poorer blue-collar workers in the
polluted city.  <p>

What evolved from this the appearance of urban ghettos and middle-class suburbs.<p>

<p>

The job market as well as other economic markets boomed as a result of auto sales
boom.  There had to be workers that could produce the autos.  There had to be
factories erected to house auto-production operations.  Roads had to be built and
paved.  These specially trained individuals had to learn their trades, so an early
model of  the vocational tech school was needed.<p>

<p>

<i><u>Moral</i></u><p>

	The moral issue was surely intertwined in the "new technology" of the auto.  Flink
argues that the auto was the start of the breakdown of family relations and of
morality.  The auto gave eager teens a place to be deviant(basically sexual acts and
"making out").  The relationship between parents and teens was demolished. 
Where teens might be "forced" to converse with parents(after there wasn't
anywhere to go), now teens could borrow or steal the car and go pretty much
wherever they wanted.  Families and neighbors used to sit on the porch and
socialize, now everyone has somewhere to go.<p>

<p>

<i><u>Environmental</i></u><p>

	The auto forever change the lands and the environment in ways that would pave the
path for future technologies.  The auto technology demanded the manipulation of
earth resources like steel, glass, oil, ect.  The Earth's resources were molded and
fixed into the raw materials needed to produce the auto.  The autos needed a place
to travel that would less stressful on them than having to travel over fields and
rockbeds, thus roadways were born.  Waterways had to be produced to get water
and electricity out to the outskirts of town where many had chosen to settle.  New
homesteads and ranches built up required clearing of small forests and wildernesses. 
The face of American was definitely changing.<p>

<p>

The auto was the beginning of a huge technological boom in American history.  The
"snowball" effect of technology can clearly be seen with the emergence of the auto
industry.  Ellul and McGinn frequently write of being overrun by technology, well
the auto is a clear example.  With the invention of the auto, came the emergence of
all these other industries and issues.  The auto could also be interpreted as one of
the beginnings of what Winters calls <i>technological drift, </i>and it continues today.  It's
got to be bigger, faster, smarter, until the end of existence.  <i> </i><p>
