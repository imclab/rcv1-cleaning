You phoned late that afternoon and said my car was ready for &quot;pickup&quot;  When I asked about a ride, I was told it would be hours and I interpreted this to mean perhaps even the next day. So I put my thumb out and hitchhike a ride with a neighbor diving down the street!<br>2. On arrival, I was told because of the weather??? you had not vacumed or washed vehicle.  I had spent most of day, with several neighbors in a shot sleave shirt occasionally seeing blue sky and sunshine cleaning up the leaves on the street from elderly shutin and so that leaves would not clog the drains on our long street when the predicted storm arrived the next morning."

I didn&#039;t feel like I was in a oil change assembly line like I have at places like Jiffy Lube. They changed my oil and did a 40 point inspection of my car, washed the outside and vacuumed the inside. They let me know about some potential work that needed to be done on my car but didn&#039;t pressure me to make an appointment or have them fix it then and there. The waiting area, though small, is clean and nice, and the staff was professional. I even got a small bag of candy as a thank you. It took me about 25 minutes to get there because of where I live so it&#039;s kinda far for an oil change, but I was so impressed by this staff that I will definitely be coming back. Kudos to the staff at University Automotive for their quality work and great customer service. :)"
