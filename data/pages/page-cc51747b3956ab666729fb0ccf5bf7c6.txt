I have a Chevy Lumina 1995, and the Blue Book value of the car is about $2850. The car is in good condition and still runs fine but due to a recent accident needs replacement of:
- right and left front headlights 
- hood (it got bent)
- bumper (it got dented)
- air conditioner (A/C condenser + radiator)

One repair shop owner declared the car a "total loss" and said the repair cost would be $3000, including parts replacement + labor + painting costs.
However, another shop owner managed to put fo<br><br>
