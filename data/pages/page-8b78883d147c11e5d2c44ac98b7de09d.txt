		<h2>What was ROK ICT!?</h2>
		
			<p>In the summer of 2008, Jared Brickman founded ROK ICT! in an effort to garner attention for the music and arts community in Wichita, KS. What started as a simple events calendar, grew into a multi-faceted organization that participated in arts advocacy, published a comprehensive guide to the Wichita arts community and produced events.</p>
		
		<h2>What was the mission of ROK ICT!?</h2>
			
			<p>As stated in its mission statement:</p>
			
			<p>"ROK ICT! is an organization working to foster a positive attitude for, and activity within, the Wichita arts community. We create and implement projects that focus on increasing communication, information accessibility, community involvement, and advocacy. Our organization performs a wide variety of activities, such as web development/hosting, event production, and coordinating volunteer efforts."</p>
			
			<p>Tagline: "get out. get known. be a part of it."</p>
		
		<h2>Did it succeed?</h2>
			
			<p>In the sense that it garnered a greater awareness of the bounty of artistic talent Wichita, KS has to offer? Yes. In a way that allowed the organization to sustain itself and help create sustainable living wages for full time musicians, artists and the like? No.</p>
		
		<h2>History</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>On November 8th, 2008, ROKICT.com was launched as an event calendar and social network focused on Wichita arts.</li>
				<li>In December of 2008, ROK ICT! joined Hartke Records, and the Wichita Downtown Development Corporation to form the First Friday committee.</li>
				<li>On April 3rd, 2009, in collaboration with over a dozen downtown businesses, ROK ICT! produced the debut of First Friday - Wichita's Downtown Music Crawl.</li>
				<li>On November 6th, 2009, ROK ICT! announced a partnership with NakedCity Magazine, in which the two would work together to produce NakedCityWichita.com, an online resource for local arts featuring an events calendar, artist/venue listings and blogs.</li>
				<li>On January 12th, 2010 ROK ICT! introduced local music to Wichita's new INTRUST Bank Arena, with the "ROK ICT! Local Music Night", featuring 14 local performing acts.</li>
				<li>In February of 2010, ROK ICT! closed its project with NakedCityWichita.com and moved the event calendar, artist listing, and venue listing back to ROKICT.com.</li>
				<li>In April of 2010, ROK ICT! relaunched of ROKICT.com as the premiere resource for information about Wichita arts.</li>
				<li>In June of 2011, ROK ICT! ended its activities and wished Wichita the best.</li>

		<h2>Letter from the Creator</h2>
			<p>Dear Wichita,</p>
			
			<p>You are as congenial and supportive as a New York transplant could hope a MidWestern city would be. Thank you for so graciously welcoming me to your community and allowing me to take my best shot at a music career in your fair city. Truly, you harbor creative, passionate and dedicated arts professionals that rival those of any other locale and those people deserve the attention of the world.</p>
			
			<p>There are many people whom, without their support, ROK ICT! and many of its creations would've remained a dream. To everybody who gave their time and their passion to the organization - thank you. I'd be remiss if I didn't offer my deep gratitude to a couple of friends:</p> 
			
			<p>First and foremost, my thanks goes to Jason Dilts. He deeply believed in a brighter future for the Wichita community and he helped me learn that there are many occasions (if not all) when congenitally (read: political correctness and good PR) trump impassioned japes. Though I may have had my differences with Adam Hartke, our friendship born of identical musical tastes, goofy senses of humor and a passion to help original musicians take the limelight will be one that I will not soon forget. Together, the three of us made up "those ROK ICT! guys" and I'm glad I had a chance to share the wild ride with them.</p>
			
			<p>I learned a lot from my journey with ROK ICT! and will take with me lessons that I will heed for the remainder of my career. It's my hope, that at least in some small way, I was able to make a difference for the artists and the fans who call Wichita home. Ultimately, I wish the best for doo-dah and hope all of Wichita's talent continues to find means by which they can connect with fans.</p>
			
			<p>Thanks again for letting me be a part of it.</p>
			
			<p>Your fan,<br/>
