<description><![CDATA[No one wakes up in the morning and says, 'I want to gain 150 pounds and I will start right now.' Weight and body oppression is oppressive to everyone. When you live in a society that says that one kind of body is bad and other is good, those with "good" bodies constantly fear that their bodies will go "bad".]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Rush hour traffic is definitely one thing that I will not miss in retirement. For years I have had the opportunity to commute in the not so wonderful, but definitely wacky world of rush-hour traffic. Want to know what a person is really like? Watch them behind the wheel of a car as their normally hidden psychopathologies emerge like Dracula from a coffin. I have noticed that there are a typical cast of characters on the freeway during rush hour. The cars and people may vary, but the behaviors are the same all contributing to the driving experience. This essay is a tongue-in-cheek look at six types of drivers I am sure you will recognize: Mario Weaver, Fastlane Freddie, Roger Roadrage, Sally Slowmo, Conrad Convoy, and Don Cruise (me making fun of myself). Add some fun to your next commute by seeing how many you can identify among the other drivers around you.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA["The first rule of (the Secrets of Life) is: you don't ever talk about (the Secrets of Life)." This is a direct quote from Brad Pitt. But I'm going to talk about them, for just this one instance... because it's important that everyone knows these secrets. I mean, everyone knows them, of course... that's why everyone does them, but just in case, under the bizarre circumstance that someone didn't know one of these rules, I think it's best that we talk about them just this once. That way no one has an unfair advantage over anyone else in the game of life. (Like the time that paraplegic was allowed to run in the Olympics against those "non-prosthetic-legged" people... so unfair.)]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[When it comes to good manners both the English and Frenchman in me are equally convinced that in a civilized society generally-agreed codes of respect and consideration towards others - especially when strangers or barely known - are vital in reducing the risk of conflict or offence in the requests, agreements, refusals, apologies, greetings and partings which are so much a part of our everyday lives. Both are also not without knowing that polite behaviour consists in maintaining a fine balance between showing you think well of others, and not giving others the impression you think too well of yourself...]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Who hasn't laughed at one of the most famous sketches in the history of British television comedy, the 'Dead Parrot Sketch' from Monty Python's Flying Circus? Well, one person comes to mind. A rival political party had adopted the image of a bird for its logo. Margaret Thatcher's speech writers encouraged her to quote from the dead parrot sketch to lampoon her rivals. This she did do at the party conference. But the story goes that she had been initially reluctant to use it because she just hadn't found it funny. The sketch illustrates one common element in comedy which is delight at feeling superior to others, like when we laugh at their misfortunes or shortcomings in contrast to ourselves -- like seeing someone hoodwinked by a pet salesman. The question arises whether laughing at the misfortunes of others is a good thing to do. Is all laughter healthy?]]></description>

The secret to performing a successful corporate show is achieving the same intimate relationship with a large audience that is achieved through a successful performance at the comedy club level. There are ways to achieve this intimacy and the professional corporate comedian uses them with fun and finesse.]]></description>
