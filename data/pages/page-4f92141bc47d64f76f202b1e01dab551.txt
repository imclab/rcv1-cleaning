I blurred the booty not only to save everyone from NSFW imagery but also because I find it hilariously ironic to censor Miley&#8217;s rear after we all saw it hanging out of vinyl on Sunday evening.

As I said yesterday (and as it was happening on Sunday), I thought Miley looked and acted like the biggest cracked-out stripper that ever was. Some say she was obviously on drugs, some say she was just high on attention. It was all just embarrassing and gross and people are still&hellip;</div>

<div class="entry-bound">Posted on ANDPOP: Fifth Harmony just released their music video for their second single &#8220;Me &amp; My Girls&#8221; and it&#8217;s a smash! Girl power!

<div class="entry-bound">Lamar Odom was spotted yesterday driving his SUV in the San Fernando Valley which isn&#8217;t all that far from his home with Khloe Kardashian.   From the pics on TMZ, it looks as though his face was a bit worn and he may have shed a few pounds.   Odom was first kicked out of his house by Khloe last Wednesday after a failed intervention.  Sources now say that Odom was probably laying low for a bit but no one is 100% certain of this.    Word has it that Khloe is not giving up on the NBA player and that the two have reportedly met in the last 48 hrs.

<div class="entry-bound">The long anticipated NSYNC reunion at the VMAs was over before you knew it. If you got up to get a drink of water you missed what was supposed to be a 15 minute performance by the &#8216;boy band&#8217;. The reason the performance was so short? Diva Justin Timberlake decided he wanted to cut it down to a brief medley of NSYNC classics &#8220;Gone&#8221;, &#8220;Bye Bye Bye&#8221;, and &#8220;Girlfriend&#8221;. According to The Huffington Post, Joey Fatone, Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick, and JC Chasez were originally &#8216;upset&#8217; that the solo artist decided to cut their performance&hellip;</div>

<div class="entry-bound">In what should come as a surprise to many people, 55-year old Madonna tops Forbes&#8217; list of highest paid celebrities this past year. The still-performing star raked in a ridiculous $125 million. A large portion of this money comes from her $305 million grossing MDNA tour with some added revenue streams from her fragrance, clothing, and other various investments. Coming in a distant second was director Steven Spielberg at $100 million, who earned a large portion of his money from his box office hit &#8220;Lincoln&#8221;. Believe it or not, Spielberg still rakes in a fortune from his&hellip;</div>

<div class="entry-bound">After a long hiatus Eminem has made a triumphant return to the rap game. Marshall Mathers didn&#8217;t need to twerk or do anything obscene to make some noise at the VMAs. Instead, the rapper dropped a 15-second tease for one of the tracks of his new album, along with the title and release date during a short commercial for Dr. Dre&#8217;s beats headphones. According to the NY Daily News , &#8220;MMLP2&#8243; named after his first big record &#8220;Marshall Mathers LP&#8221;, is the first album since the Grammy Winner&#8217;s 2010 album &#8220;Recovery&#8221;. The album is due to hit stores&hellip;</div>
