<font face="Arial, Verdana, Sans Serif"><font size="+1"><center><b>How the Buying &amp; Selling Scam Works in a Nutshell.</b></center></font><br />
<font size="-1">Legitimate Seller (LS) places an ad for the vehicle on the Internet (or elsewhere) with an e-mail address for responses.<br /><br />
Scamster Buyer (SB) responds to ad saying he'll pay the full asking price plus some extra. Different reasons are given for the extra amount, usually for shipping the vehicle to a foreign country or because someone owes SB some money. The extra amount is usually between $4,000 and $10,000. Moreover, SB offers to pay with a cashier's check!<br /><br />
LS is amazed and delighted to be able to sell his vehicle for the full asking price and responds to SB.<br /><br />
SB responds immediately but then some kind of delay usually crops up.<br /><br />
Eventually, SB sends the cashier's check to LS, but it is mailed from a foreign country (to thwart USPS investigators checking on postal fraud).<br /><br />
LS replies to SB that the cashier's check has arrived and, presumably, deposits it in his bank. The bank honors the cachier's check (usually within 1 or 2 days) and makes the money available to LS.<br /><br />
SB urgently requests that the difference between the cashier's check and the cost of the vehicle be sent or wired to his shipping agent after which he will make arrangements to pick up the vehicle. Sometimes a bank transfer is requested.<br /><br />
LS sends or wires the money or makes a transfer to SB's account.<br /><br />
Days or weeks later, LS is informed by his bank that the cashier's check is counterfeit. SB has disappeared. The vehicle is never picked up.<br /><br />

<b>The original ad</b> appeared on my web site back in early 2003. Here's what it said: "This 1&#189;-ton Chevrolet G-7107 truck was delivered to the military in April 1942 as a cargo truck. The crash truck body and Marquette manual wrecker boom were added later, but probably while the truck was still in use by the military. The same boom was installed on 50 Ford GTBB 1&#189;-ton wrecker/service trucks. It is likely that the truck was used by the U.S. Army Air Corps, probably in Korea.<br />
<dd>Restoration work has been started. The body has been completely sandblasted, all of the rust has been removed, holes patched, metal straightened, and it has four coats of primer. The engine had a depot rebuild in 1961, although it is not currently running. I have new wiring harnesses, stainless steel brake lines, and many other new parts, but they must be installed. The cab, obviously, needs a great deal of work.<br />
<dd>I have $4500 into this project, but I'll consider any reasonable offer or a <b>trade for a quad ATV</b> or some interesting vehicle that will fit in my garage. Call me, David Ahl (Tel: 973-285-0716) and let's talk about it."

Hi:<br />
Pretty much all the information about the wrecker plus photos are on my web site at http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Chevy/index.html. The engine hasn't been turned over in many years, so it may (or may not) be stuck. I have many cartons of new parts (glass, brake lines, wiring harnesses, etc.) that go with the truck. 
Re: payment. I would insist on having your check clear before shipping the vehicle or issuing a check for the difference in price. The vehicle is located in Parsippany, New Jersey right off Interstate 80. It weighs a bit over 4 tons, length 224", width 86" <br /><br />

<b>Two months pass. Then on Friday, 6/11/04 the check finally arrives!</b> The check comes alone with no cover letter or any explanation in a plain white envelope mailed 6/3/04 from Rotterdam, Netherlands. The return address is "John David, Groen Hilledijk 208B, 3074 AB R'Dam, Netherland."<br /><br />
The check, dated 5/20/04, is a cashier's check for the amount of $9,500 drawn on Peoples Bank of Northern Kentucky. It is made out to Ciao, David Aw and has a remitter's name of Jonathan Ben.<br /><br />
<img src="CheckSm.jpg" align="middle" hspace="8" alt="Cashier's check" /><br clear="all" /><br />
I note that several things look "wrong" about the check. First, it is not trimmed squarely with the border. Second, under a magnifying glass, the micro-print signature line is blurry and indistinct. Third, the paper does not have a watermark or thermochromic icon as it should.<br /><br />
Nevertheless, I take it to my bank and ask for a second opinion. The teller sees no problem with it, nor does a bank officer (which in my humble opinion is a sad commentary on typical bank employees today). I point out the problems I see in the check and the bank officer reluctantly offers to call Peoples Bank of Kentucky to check on it. After two phone calls and an on-line check with the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions, we learn that Peoples Bank is defunct and has been acquired by the Bank of Kentucky. Will they honor this check? No one seems to have a definitive answer, but the sense I'm getting is "probably not." I'm reluctant to deposit it since a bounced check will cost me $20. But "Jeff" doesn't have to know that, so I send him the following e-mail on 6/16/04.<br /><br />
Hi Jeff:<br />
I received your cashier's check for $9,500 today for my Chevy 1-1/2-ton USAAF Wrecker. The check is made out to "Ciao, David Aw" instead of to my name which is "David Ahl" but I think I'll be able to cash it. When do you want to pick up the truck? (By the way, "ciao" is an Italian word of greeting or parting that I often use in my letters and e-mail because my daughter lives in Italy.)<br />Best regards,<br />David Ahl

Dear Mr Ahl<br />

THIS IS NOT AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE<br /><br />

Thank you for your submission to the FBI Internet Tip Line. In as much as the FBI receives reports of this type of activity on a regular basis there is no need to forward any such additional emails to us.<br /><br />

A review of the information you provided revealed that you are being approached over the Internet to participate in one of many variations of an advance fee scheme being perpetrated by individuals from various West African nations, particularly Nigeria. This scam has also become popular and perpetrated by individuals all over the world, including in Korea and the UK. Victims have lost substantial funds in the past and all requests for travel to foreign locations should be ignored. The United States Secret Service (USSS) has developed an excellent, detailed description of this fraud scheme, which can be accessed at <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/alert419.shtml"><b>www.secretservice.gov/alert419.shtml</b></a>. If you have been victimized by one of these schemes, please forward appropriate written documentation to the USSS, Financial Crimes Division, 950 H Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20223, or contact them via telephone at (202) 406-5850. We encourage you to share this Web page with family and friends. Your continued cooperation in this and other matters is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />
[Although the FBI identified this as an "advanced fee fraud," it is NOT and the Secret Service web site noted, while interesting, has no relevant information about this type of fraud.]

Hi Jeff (or whatever your name is):<br />
Your cashier's check is FAKE! You're trying to CHEAT me. I've turned over everything to the FBI and I'm sure you be hearing from the FBI or from Interpol very soon. Why don't you get an honest job instead of trying to cheat people out of their money?<br /><br />
And don't go throwing around the name of God because He takes a very dim view of cheating and fraud. Here is what the Bible says about fraud in Micah 2:1-3. Woe to you who lie awake at night, plotting wickedness; you rise at dawn to carry out your schemes; because you can, you do. You want a certain piece of land or someone else's house (though it is all he has); you take it by fraud and threats and violence. But the Lord God says, "I will reward your evil with evil; nothing can stop me; never again will you be proud and haughty after I am through with you."<br /><br />

<font face="Arial, Verdana, Sans Serif"><font size="+1"><center><b>Scam is widespread all over the world.</b></center></font><br /><font size="-1">
The auto buying scam surfaced around 2002 with the first "offers to buy" coming from Nigeria. It seems somewhat more believable than the money transfer scam that offers you millions of dollars if you'll just allow some ill-gotten gains to be transferred into your bank account.<br /><br />The auto buying scam works for three reasons: first, the amount of money is not totally outrageous. Second, it is a response to your ad rather than an e-mail out of the blue. Third, your bank will give you immediate access to cash when they receive a cashier's check from another bank. It then takes a good bit of time for the actual check to be physically processed through the Federal Reserve system, sent to the issuing bank, found to be fraudulent, returned through the system to your bank, and notification sent to you. This process can easily take two weeks or more.<br /><br />
On 11/4/03, the Internet Fraud Complaint Center posted this warning:<br />
"The scheme targets individuals that use Internet classified ads to sell merchandise. Typically, an interested party located outside the United States contacts a seller. The seller is told that the buyer has an associate in the United States that owes him money. As such, he will have the associate send the seller a cashier's check for the amount owed to the buyer. This amount will be thousands of dollars more than the price of the merchandise, and the seller is told the excess amount will be used to pay the shipping costs associated with getting the merchandise to his location. The seller is instructed to deposit the check, and as soon as it clears, to wire (Western Union) the excess funds back to the buyer, or to another associate identified as a shipping agent. In most instances, the money is sent to locations in West Africa (Nigeria). Because a cashier's check is used, a bank will typically release the funds immediately, or after a one or two day hold. Falsely believing the check has cleared, the seller wires the money as instructed. In some cases, the buyer is able to convince the seller that some circumstance has arisen that necessitates the cancellation of the sale, and is successful in conning the victim into sending the remainder of the money. Shortly thereafter, their bank notifies the victim that the check was fraudulent, and the bank is holding the victim responsible for the full amount of the check."<br /><br />
I have no idea how many people have been taken in by the scam, but it has spread all over the world and has morphed into many variations. For example, here is an e-mail that I received on 6/17/04 from mmerah231@latinmail.com. Note on this one, the sender didn't even bother to fill in my name, the vehicle details or the price. Rather cheeky, I'd say.<br /><br />
