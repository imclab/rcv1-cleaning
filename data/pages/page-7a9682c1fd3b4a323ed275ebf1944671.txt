The e-journal <span style="font-style: italic;">Lexis</span> is
planning to publish its nineth issue, which will focus on the status of
the lexicon in speaker-centered theories, in June 2014.<br>
These theories differ from other theories, in so far as they seek to
analyse languages through attested utterances. As a result, they try to
take into account the context of the utterances, the relationship
between the speaker and the co-speaker, as well as the conversational
data involved, in order to explain their form and how their
interpretation is construed.<br>
This issue of<span style="font-style: italic;"> E-Lexis</span> aims to
explore the extent to which these theoretical choices have an impact on
the way the lexicon is envisaged and how the relations between lexicon,
syntax, morphology, phonology, pragmatics, semantics are organised. Are
these domains independent or do they interact ?<br>
A number of previous studies have focussed on the search to define an
"invariant" or "basic value", underlying various phenomena, and it is
necessary to establish whether it is through these particular analyses
that the lexicon has found its place in the theory.<br>
What is a lexical unit in this approach ? What is its status ?<br>
Using contextualised examples, the articles can propose specific
analyses, in order to understand divergences from other theoretical
approaches, or possible similarities. They can also consider related
epistemological questions. <br>
Manuscripts may be written in French or English and should be
accompanied by an abstract of up to 10 lines in French and English, as
well as a list of 5 key words. They should be sent to the General
Editor of Lexis, Denis Jamet, as e-mail attachments, (Word and pdf),
and will be refereed by members of the international Scientific
Committee. (Manuscripts may be accepted either in their original form,
subject to revision or refused). Articles are limited to 8,000 words,
excluding references ; data sets and illustrative and complementary
material can be accommodated in appendices, for which there is no size
limit.<br>

Editor: P. Prayer Elmo Raj<br>
            <br>
India is a constitutionally declared secular state. However, the recent
political, social and religious events and turns have challenged
secularism with its casteist, communalist, religious fundamentalist and
separatist attitudes. Asghar Ali Engineer, a reformist and prophetic
voice of modern India, has dealt in deepness the roots of Indian
secularism, the interplay between state and religion, and the manner in
which contemporary secularism is threatened/practiced by the
political/religious events unravelled in present context with a voice
that emphatically called for harmony. Secularism and the interplay
between religion and state is a relevant question today than ever. The
proposed edited volume is an attempt to bring in secular voices and
critical perspectives on historical and contemporary secularist
theoretical perspectives and modes, secularist view points on the
interface between religion and politics today, communalism,
fundamentalism and creative and existential facets of tolerance in
memory of a person who, throughout his extraordinary career, has
promoted the values of religious and communal co-existence, tolerance
and mutual understanding.<br>
            <br>
Themes of focus may include but are not restricted to:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) India and secularism:

Literature</span>
is a peer-refereed online journal published by the Department of the
English Language and the Department of English Language Literatures at
Opole University, Poland (for more information see <a href="http://%20www.explorations.uni.opole.pl">http://
www.explorations.uni.opole.pl</a>). The December 2013 issue of
Explorations takes as its theme the notion of limits.<br>
            <br>
The language section chooses as its motto Wittgenstein's famous words:
"the limits of my language mean the limits of my world." We thus seek
articles that investigate the connections between language and human
thought and/or explore the ways in which our understanding of such
connections influences or limits the study and teaching of language in
the academy.<br>
            <br>
The literature section invites articles which critically examine
encounters or confrontations involving literary and non-literary works
as they reach the limits of the conventions imposed on them. What
happens when such limits have been crossed? What kind of extra-literary
space is opened when a literary text interacts with a painting, a movie
or a musical composition and is transformed by them? What is the nature
of such interactions? Can we speak of "pure literature"? Or maybe we
should say that the literary work is necessarily infected with other
modes of expression? Is writing just writing?<br>
            <br>
Contributions are expected by June 30, 2013. Notifications of
acceptance will be sent by September 30, 2013.<br>

universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home &#8212; so close
and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet
they are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he lives
in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm, or office
where he works. Such are the places where every man, woman, and child
seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without
discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have
little meaning anywhere. Without concerted citizen action to uphold
them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger
world."&nbsp; Eleanor Roosevelt, presentation of : <span style="font-style: italic;">IN YOUR HANDS: A Guide for Community

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The sixth issue of the
on-line journal e-CRIT3224 ( <a href="http://e-crit3224.univ-fcomte.fr">http://e-crit3224.univ-fcomte.fr</a>
) published by the research centre CRIT at the Université de
Franche-Comté (Besançon), will be devoted to the notion of human rights
as it has been defined, used and embodied in English language
literatures. Articles will be published in English or in French. This
issue intends to investigate how this universal notion has been the
setting or subject of poems, plays, novels, short stories or
autobiographies written in English, over the ages and across
continents. It will also study how literature has exposed Human Rights
abuse or lauded its defenders.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
From the spirit of the French Revolution that imbued Romanticism, to
slave narratives in North America, to Tony Morrison's quest for
origins, to writings on and from the Celtic periphery, the notion of
respect for or acquisition of human rights has played central role in
both fictional and autobiographical production written from the margin.
Postcolonial literatures, be they Indian, North-American or African,
have equally found in the literary form a fertile ground to express the
experience of colonialism and its aftermath&nbsp; or give voice to
those committed to the coming of a fairer society in which the right of
minorities are respected.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Human Rights should here be understood as those expressed by the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the following themes could be
studied in relation to fictional treatment: the alienation of
indigenous land by settlers, the oppression of minorities, the
economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) of oppressed communities,
freedom of expression, women&#8217;s rights and equal opportunities, domestic
violence, the right to education, the supporters of human rights and
the fight against oppression, at a local, individual level.<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">For
over four decades G.B. Trudeau's <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>
strip has reflected and refracted America's national narratives,
atomising and coalescing them within the strip format to a global
audience. Chronicling, dramatising and defining key debates of the
late-twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries, the Pulitzer
prize-winning Doonesbury has also intervened in and shaped their
trajectory. Using and subverting the narrative strip form as a prism
through which to explore, catalogue, landmark and define its
contemporary moment, <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>
represents a significant artistic, cultural, comedic and critical
achievement.<br>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>'s
status as a symptomatic corollary, imaginative rendition,
cultural-historical document, and exploration of America, as well as
the strip&#8217;s diversity of interests, global reach, and cultural
reception and standing, offer fertile grounds for fresh contemporary
readings hitherto unfulfilled by academic engagement. Proposals are
therefore invited for an edited collection of critical and cultural
essays to be published through Manchester University Press that engage
with the long-running, iconic strip.<br>
            <br>
The following themes are broadly suggested as points for discussion and
points of departure for submitted proposals:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>: comedy and comment.<br>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>'s narrative
form: fragmentation, linearity and cohesion:<br>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span> 40: A
Retrospective: the great American novel?<br>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span> and the American
pastoral: from Thoreau to Walden commune and beyond.<br>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>, representation,
war and trauma: Vietnam, Iraq 1, the war on terror, Iraq 2, Afghanistan
and the war within.<br>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span> and the comic
tradition: art, satire, liberty and independence.<br>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>'s and America's
political debates.<br>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span> and activism:
civil and/or gay rights representation.<br>
- Reach and syndication: virtual <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>,
the daily strip and the dot com.<br>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>, the
counter-culture and the baby-boomers: from protest to Gen X.<br>
- On the cover of <span style="font-style: italic;">Rolling Stone:</span>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>, music,
business and cultural representation.<br>
- Bright Lights, Big City: <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>
and the eighties.<br>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span> and the American
presidency: idealism, reality and representation.<br>
- <span style="font-style: italic;">Doonesbury</span>, humour,
dissidence and censorship.<br>
            </div>
            <br>
It must be stressed that these are only suggested areas of discussion
and that proposals dealing with any aspect of the strip, or advancing

is seeking contributions to a special issue on Attention, Agency,
Affect: In the Flow of Performing Audiences.<br>
            <br>
Since their controversial inception on the academic cultural stage of
the last five decades, Performance Studies have always vindicated an
inter-disciplinary or anti-disciplinary engagement with the
interstitial and translational aspects of any politics of identity and
culture, stressing the centrality of the body, the everyday, and affect
in all aspects of human activity. At the same time, performance as a
central, even if contentious, metaphor for almost any form of
contemporary critical discourse &#8220;implies not just doing or even
re-doing, but a self-consciousness about doing and re-doing on the part
of both performers and spectators&#8221; (Carlson 2004) calling into question
traditional interpretations of the ways in which 'texts do things with
words.'<br>
            <br>
Starting from these premises we welcome contributions that discuss the
contested concept of &#8216;participation&#8217; from an inter-disciplinary
perspective, investigating how a critical focus on performance and
performativity can help to reframe, revise and challenge existing
notions of publics and audiences (both as spectators and as readers).<br>
            <br>
Suggested topics include but are not limited to:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">- the impact of performing
arts and relational models of spectatorship upon literary studies with
particular attention to digital literature;<br>
- the creative and critical interplay between authorial textuality and
performative event;<br>
- the relations between recently emerging participatory modes of
spectatorship and other models of social and communal interaction in
the dramatic context of glocalization;<br>
- the importance of orality, physicality and affect; <br>
- the influences of audience reception theory, feminist and queer
theory, cultural and postcolonial studies.<br>

            <br>
Indian aesthetics is a unique philosophical and spiritual point of view
on art, architecture and literature. The theory and practice of
aesthetics is a psychic and perceptive activity that envelopes and
reflects the wholistic experience of beauty enquiring and appreciating
the realm of aesthetic. The rich tradition of Indian aesthetics can be
traced back to the 2nd century BC with Bharata's <span style="font-style: italic;">Natyasasthra</span>,
the foundation text of Indian aesthetics and followed by significant
treatises on art, architecture and literature that proposed theories
which assist us with significantly varied approaches to aesthetically
appraise and appreciate a work of art. Moreover, the contributions of
Ananda Coomaraswamy and K. C. Pandey have opened up fresh possibilities
to rethink ways of renarrating, contextualizing, conversing and
communicating comparatively Indian aesthetics with aesthetic traditions
around the world. The proposed edited volume is an attempt to bring
together fresh theoretical/critical perspectives on Indian Aesthetics
and diverse efforts to interpret/appreciate/critique art, architecture,
music and literature in terms of Indian aesthetics that allows us to
rethink, reinterpret and retrace the significance and inimitability of
the theory and practice today as we live in an age of proliferation of
art, architecture, music and literature.&nbsp; <br>
Themes of focus may include but are not restricted to:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) Critical and interpretive perspectives on Indian aesthetics<br>
2) Contemporary approaches to Indian Aesthetics<br>
3) Indian Aesthetics as&nbsp; a method/critical tool to interpret art, architecture and literature<br>
4) Comparative Aesthetics<br>
5) History of Indian Aesthetics<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">Beauty,
like Monstrosity, is a cultural construction framed by the fears,
anxieties and aspirations of a particular time and place. Yet the
configuration of both as tools of inclusion and/or exclusion position
them more as sides of the same coin rather than Manichean opposites.
This is clearly seen in the way that many monsters are often shown as
beautiful, luring their victims into their dead embrace, just as Beauty
itself is revealed as a cruel and thankless master/mistress, whose
monstrous nature is hidden beneath a veneer of aesthetic perfection.
Within this, of course, are also the ways that the Monster is itself
shown to be beautiful, not necessarily for any exterior attributes,
though this is sometimes the case, but for an inner, spiritual
splendour that points to universal qualities beyond that of simple
perception.<br>
            <br>
This special issue of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Monsters
and the Monstrou</span>s

monstrous is truly beautiful and that beauty is the stuff of nightmares.<br>

This issue will focus on the correlations between initial elements
(i.e. elements that precede the subject and/or verb), or their absence,
and certain "linguistic events" which occur in the host sentence and in
the textual sequence (the following and preceding sentences).<br>
We invite studies based on one or more substantial annotated and
diversified corpora, which approach the topic from a contrastive
viewpoint (e.g. inter-genre or inter-language).<br>
The recommended methodology (studies on annotated corpora, with no
restriction on the software tools used) will enable observation and
quantitative and qualitative analysis of various phenomena linked to
word order and text structuring.<br>
Such approaches will enable large-scale studies of the possible
combinations between the various types of initial elements. They can be
considered from the following viewpoints: morpho-syntactic (adverb,
nominal group, subordinate, etc.), syntactic (complements,
circumstances, etc.), semantic (spatio-temporal, enunciative, manner
elements, etc.), informational (topic, focus, etc.), or preferably by
combining several of these perspectives.<br>
How many initial elements can be found? Of what types? What are the
possible combinations?<br>
The objective is to focus on regularities in the way the various
syntagms are arranged according to their type, while at the same time
relating them to the characteristics of other component parts of the
sentence (e.g. In the case of verb/subject inversion, which IE are
likely to appear?). Consideration should also be given to the influence
of the previous context, by paying attention to the informational and
textual structuring of the preceding utterances. For example, it may be
possible to observe phenomena of thematic (dis)continuity and the
cognitive status of the referents involved (where relevant), either in
the initial elements themselves or in the subject of the host sentence.<br>
It may also be possible to throw light on the respective
characteristics of utterances with or without initial elements, and to
see if they are linked to considerations of genre and language.<br>
The studies submitted should have at least one of the following
perspectives:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">- either a relatively
general study of initial elements, of the various possible combinations
and their impact on the sentence in a specific type of text (e.g.
history articles in French)<br>
- or a more specifically targeted study on a specific initial element
(e.g. temporal elements and the position of the subject) in a
diversified corpus.<br>

            <div style="text-align: justify;">'Above all, no body, no
body proper has ever touched -- with a hand or through skin contact --
something as abstract as a limit. Inversely, however, and that is the
destiny of this figurality, all one ever does is touch a limit.'<br>

Treatments of corporeality have piled high in literary and cultural
studies, especially in the last twenty years or so, while questions of
embodiment continue to proliferate in philosophical discussion. At the
same time, metaphorical bodies loom large: humanities scholars have
shown renewed critical interest in variously shaped ideas of the body
politic, past and present; corpus linguistics works with ever-larger
'corporae' of everyday language. Bodies, 'real' or 'imagined', never
lose the potential to unsettle. However, discussions of corporeality
tend to be carried, more or less subtly, by the reassuring promise of
the material body as a site of indisputable fact.<br>
We invite contributions that resist notions of bodies as self-evident
and instead investigate their limits. Poststructuralist theory provides
useful beginnings here: Deleuze and Guattari develop notions of 'bodies
without organs' that question where a body might end and how it might
relate to its realities, its limitations and its possibilities.
Jean-Luc Nancy has done much to offer ways of conceiving of bodies not
as vessels but as limits: as skins which, while they describe spaces in
their various folds, are by definition permeable, open and indefinite.
Jacques Derrida&#8217;s late work, meanwhile, can be read as showing limits
as bodies: here, conceptual limits, such as that between 'man' and
'animal', cannot police the two-dimensional, idealist division they
proclaim; instead, they are limitrophies, plural, heterogeneous,
multiply folded and changing frontiers.<br>
Thinking bodies as limits rather than facts has profound political
implications. It offers resistance to racist and (hetero) sexist
discourses that inscribe their ideologies on bodies in order to present
them as sites of tangible truth; it also challenges representations of
science as the key to universal and unlimited body knowledge. Further,
it offers ways to consider those areas of contemporary life that are
increasingly sites of the multiplication of limits: where relationships
between bodies and machines are increasingly complex, and the links
between the two increasingly obvious, what does this mean for notions
of the body/bodies? Tekhne, Derrida notes, is perhaps always an
invention of limits; how then, are the limits of bodies invented in
today&#8217;s technoscience? How are they kept in place? Who/what polices the
boundaries? Finally, there can be no thinking of body-machines without
thinking of body politics, of the ways in which the bodies of
languages, of nations, of institutions old and new, even of the
multiple and electronically folded limits of the digital age, are
installed as well as challenged.<br>

Topics for contributions may include, but are not limited to:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">- Cultural histories of
body limits past and present. This includes questions of how
contemporary notions of bodies are, or go beyond, 'the body as a
Western invention'.<br>
- If writing takes its place at the limit (Nancy), how is literature,
past and present, both product and production of body limits?<br>
- Deconstructions and reconsiderations of phenomenologies of bodies and
their limits (Jean-Luc Nancy, Jacques Derrida, Maurice Merleau-Ponty,
Martin Heidegger, Max Scheler, et al.).<br>
- Digital technologies and virtual realities: how do we feel the limits
of digital bodies of control? And how do they cut across human and
other animal bodies?<br>
- Body technologies and the limits they grow -- within 'modern
technology' as we know it, as well as before and outside it. What are
the limits and implications of senses that are prosthetically altered
and enhanced?<br>
- What are the politics of any one representation of body limits? This
might include staging of bodies in popular, media and consumer culture
as well as literature and art.<br>
-How do the bodies of languages, in their untranslatability, as well as
in the ways in which they permeate and modify each other, function as
limits and limitrophies? What are the politics of these exscriptions?<br>
- Where does a linguistic 'corpus' start and what delimits it, both
theoretically and to practical, applicable ends?<br>

to this volume will study the role of humor and more largely of
entertainment in popular culture during the 1914-1918 conflict. This
collective work seeks to evaluate some aspects of transnational war
culture by examining seemingly light-hearted discourses on the First
World War.<br>
            <br>
Being one of the first turning points of twentieth century
internationalism, the Great War, as H.G. Wells once said, has to be
envisioned as "the war of the mind". Cultural life in wartime was
submitted both to strategies of promotion and blockade to channel
information and its global circulation. Propaganda and the control of
communication also participated in exacerbating patriotism, lifting up
soldiers' spirits and encouraging the civilian support of the conflict.
Despite each country's own agenda, morale boosting and motivating the
population were the most widely shared things in the world at that
time. Debunking the general sense of perdition and trauma, humor and
other forms of entertainment played a crucial role in maintaining
people&#8217;s faith in their ability to end the war and stay alive through
that modern cataclysm. <br>
            <br>
Wartime escapism through culture is often associated with the Second
World War. However, during the Great War, recreational activities or
artistic creation also served as tools of diversion, triggering
national pride and hope, among the countries of the Entente or the
Alliance powers. They also provided a way to unite the general public
behind the war effort as well as to strengthen the bonds between the
home front and the battlefront. As the world seemed to collapse,
dignity and optimism were preserved thanks to the emancipatory moments
offered by paintings and other pictorial productions (caricatures,
sketches or cartoons), literature and poetry, theater, music and
musical performances, motion pictures, leisure industry resources, aid
and relief projects, government initiatives to stimulate daily life
transformation, etc. <br>
            <br>
We would like to enhance the variety of creative experiments designed
to illuminate the present and, thus, cast a positive light on the
future, allowing citizens to believe the Great War was not the end of
everything. One of the purposes of the book is to analyze which make-do
subterfuges were proposed to people to persuade them to trust their
leaders and dream forward. Besides, humor and entertainment &#8211; from the
most waggish expression to the blackest tone &#8211; also encompass some
political and polemical dimensions, related to social critique, that
need to be discussed. The authors can focus on local practices or use
international comparisons to demonstrate how these elements contributed
to a liberating experience or a survival philosophy, but also to some
ideological schemes.<br>
            <br>

the process of publishing your article very simple and efficient.
Usually, it takes 2 to 3 months before the moment you finished your
submission and a response generated by the reviewing system. If your
paper is accepted, we will try to publish it in the current issue.<br>
            <br>
General Journal guidelines for authors: see the website.<br>
            <br>
If the authors provide a previously published conference submission,
Editors will check the submission to determine whether there has been
sufficient new material added to warrant publication in the Journal.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-style: italic;">The Journal of Teaching English for Specific and Academic Purposes</span>
guidelines are that the submissions should contain a significant amount
of new material, that is, material that has not been published
elsewhere. New results are not required; however, the submission should
contain expansions of key ideas, examples, elaborations, and so on, of
the conference submission. The paper submitted to the journal should
differ from the previously published material by at least 40 percent.<br>
            <br>
Research articles are usually about 10 pages long. However, in special
cases, shorter or longer articles may be accepted with appropriate
reasoning. Authors are requested to follow guidelines for preparing
their manuscripts. An article sample template can be found on the

topic of the 2014 issue is based on the premise that all ideologies are
gendered matters. All discourses have ideological functions of enacting
and perpetuating power asymmetries and hierarchical relations; all
discourses including those on women and by women can be
instrumentalized by current political projects. The aim of this
thematic issue&nbsp; of International Studies: Interdisciplinary
Political and Cultural Journal is to examine the relationship between
women and different ideologies through the analysis of representations
of women in different discourses &#8211; women&#8217;s discourses and discourses
about women.&nbsp; <br>
Proposals may include, but are not limited to the following topics:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8226; women's (self)
representation and social construction of womanhood in literature,
film, pop culture, mass media and arts;<br>
&#8226; discourses on women's role in politics, economics, family structure
and workplace;<br>
&#8226; discourses on women's sexuality,&nbsp; morality and reproductive
rights;<br>
&#8226; competing feminist discourses and critical theories: white, black,
postcolonial, Third World, womanism etc. <br>
&#8226; the politics on gender, motherhood and nation-building;<br>
&#8226; the study of gender and language and gendered discourse analysis; <br>
&#8226; women, historical discourses and revisionism;<br>
&#8226; women, environment and ecology;<br>
&#8226; gender and queer performativity, and transgendered desire; <br>
&#8226; global and diasporic perspectives on gender.<br>

            </div>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">The
editors will particularly pay attention to papers highlighting shifting
ideologies of gender, sexuality, race and class as intersecting dynamic
social categories imbedded in various public and academic
discourses.&nbsp; We welcome research papers which seek through
intersectional framework to understand the interaction and
interconnection among&nbsp; these concepts&nbsp; and the ways in which
they inform and influence one another. How do these interactions
promote our understanding of gender, individual and collective identity
and&nbsp; formations of community. How do they impact on ideological
and political position of women in contemporary cultures and societies?
            <br>
The study of gender is an interdisciplinary field intertwined with
feminism, queer studies, sexuality studies, postcolonial studies, and
cultural studies (to name just a few&nbsp; relevant research areas).
Consequently our thematic issue will approach feminist problems from an
interdisciplinary standpoint that&nbsp; intends to bring together
researchers form a variety of backgrounds. Papers may include various
readings of gender and ideology across a range of disciplines and
fields, and we invite contributions form both humanities and social
sciences. <br>
Abstracts of no more than 300 hundred words in word format should be
submitted&nbsp; by 30 September 2013 at the following mailing address:
penier@uni.lodz.pl. Approved applicants will be notified by 1 November
2013. Final papers should be sent by 31 January 2014.<br>

anglophone)</span> is seeking papers for a special volume to appear in
the autumn of 2014.<br>
            <br>
Lacanian analysis of literature and the arts has not been in vogue in
France for some time now. Following the publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Écrits</span>
in 1966, there was a period of analytic fascination with the imaginary
capture of the mirror phase and its intersection with the structures of
the symbolic in both literary and film studies. Since the 1980s,
academic engagement with Lacanian theory in the cultural field has been
in a slump, and this for several reasons: the reputed difficulty of
Lacan&#8217;s style as apprehended through Ecrits, the opposition of numerous
feminist critics, and the general decline of theory in the field of
literary studies.<br>
            <br>
Today, in light of the growing force of scientistic conceptions of the
human subject (at the level of intelligence, behaviour, reproduction,
the limits of the body, mortality), Lacanian theory finds renewed
relevance in its unwavering postulate of the subject as singular,
unique and incalculable, insusceptible to scientific conclusiveness. It
is the Lacanian real, generally underexamined amongst first wave
Lacanians, which gives weight to this proposition insofar as the real
is the point at which all systems fail, where the signifier encounters
its impasse, and also, the beyond of this point; both what has not
encountered signifying discourse and the structural impossibility of
the signifier to produce an 'all' of meaning. Something always escapes
the signifier. This missing 'something', the <span style="font-style: italic;">objet a</span>
in the Lacanian myth of the origins of subjectivity, takes us beyond
the split of structuralism, beyond the subject of the signifier; the
Lacanian 'speakingbeing' is foundationally dislocated by a mode of
jouissance (civilised by lalangue, the pre-signifying letter of
language) that entails "a disruption of self-identity" (Copjec, <span style="font-style: italic;">Imagine There's No Woman: Ethics and
Sublimation</span>, 2002). It is in this sense, according to Colette
Soler (<span style="font-style: italic;">Lacan, l&#8217;inconscient réinventé</span>,
2009), that Lacan affirms "The Real is the mystery of the speaking
body".<br>
            <br>
It is primarily due to the influence of Slavoj Zizek (<span style="font-style: italic;">Enjoy Your Symptom: Jacques Lacan in
Hollywood and Out,</span>
1992) and his analyses of film and literature, that Lacanian theory
within Anglophone studies has been brought back into the domain of the
speakable, the thinkable, and perhaps even the desirable, revalorizing
its potential for clarification of the ways in which subjectivity can
be understood structurally (through language) but also as the site
where the absolute singularity of the human subject meets its
historical context: "The contribution of Lacan for our present time is
therefore doubly important: on the one hand, it allows us to acquire a
clear structural understanding of the [economic] crisis as a crisis of
the symbolic; on the other hand, it reaffirms the irreducibility of the
desiring subject as such" (<span style="font-style: italic;">Alain
Badiou, Jacques Lacan: Passé Présent - Dialogue, 2012)</span>.
It is this insistence on the radical singularity of each human subject,
intrinsic to Lacanian theory that makes of it a means of thinking
against the determinist discourses of our times.<br>
            <br>
This is true not only for the subject of capitalist discourse but also
for the question of sexual difference. The debate on the implications
of sexual difference has become, in the contemporary period, enmired in
a binary struggle between sex and gender (one might say 'Huston vs.
Butler'). Lacan's theory of sexuation, by contrast, consists in an
attempt to rethink sexual difference from a non-binary perspective.
Other concepts also move critical issues beyond their current point of
articulation:&nbsp; lalangue, the pre-symbolic letter that marks the
subject in its earliest being undercuts the autonomy of the
imaginary-symbolic axis of the subject. If the symptom marks the
subject's "point of exception to the established form of social bond
and is connected to the jouissance of the body" (Lissy Canellopoulos,
"The Bodily Event, Jouissance and the (Post)Modern Subject," 2010), the
sinthome designates the subject's singular way of knotting together the
registers of the real, the symbolic and the imaginary, and on occasion,
making up for the absence of the Name-of-the-Father (rejoining the
second of Badiou's concerns). Such are some of the relatively
unexplored dimensions of Lacanian theory which might illuminate our
readings of classic and contemporary culture and its objects.<br>
            <br>
In addition to the work of Slavoj Zizek, notable interventions in the
field of cultural analysis include Ellie Ragland's "Eyes Wide Shut, The
Woman Not Seen" (<span style="font-style: italic;">European Journal of
Psychoanalysis</span>, 2005); Juliet Flower MacCannell's reading of
Margaret Atwood's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</span>
in "Things to Come: a Hysteric&#8217;s Guide to the Future Female Subject" (<span style="font-style: italic;">Supposing the Subject,</span> 1994), or
the work of Joan Copjec.<br>
            <br>
As the expression of a desire to give renewed attention to this
critical orientation and to revitalize its debates and uses for
contemporary analysis of culture, <span style="font-style: italic;">E-rea
            </span>is
seeking articles which analyze literary, filmic, or other artistic
productions from the English-speaking world from a Lacanian
perspective. If Encore, as the inaugural text of the period of the
'later Lacan' may serve as a point of reference, analyses which
mobilize such key concepts as sexuation, lalangue, other jouissance,
ethics, the sinthome, or, that elusive concept - love - will be
welcome. Addressing a wide audience of Anglophone scholars and
students, concepts should be clarified to illuminate their use in the
analyses.<br>

are invited for a special issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gothic
Studies</span> exploring intersections between the Gothic and medical
humanities.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Gothic studies has long grappled with suffering bodies, and the
fragility of human flesh in the grip of medical and legal discourse
continues to be manifest in chilling literature and film. The direction
of influence goes both ways: Gothic literary elements have arguably
influenced medical writing, such as the nineteenth-century clinical
case study. In this second decade of the twenty-first century, it seems
apt to freshly examine intersections between the two fields.<br>
The closing years of the twentieth century saw the emergence of medical
humanities, an interdisciplinary blend of humanities and social science
approaches under the dual goals of using arts to enhance medical
education and interrogating medical practice and discourse. Analysis of
period medical discourse, legal categories and medical technologies can
enrich literary criticism in richly contextualising fictional works
within medical practices. Such criticism can be seen as extending the
drive towards historicised and localised criticism that has
characterised much in Gothic studies in recent decades.<br>
Our field offers textual strategies for analysing the processes by
which medical discourse, medical processes and globalised
biotechnological networks can, at times, do violence to human bodies
and minds -- both of patient and practitioner. Cultural studies of
medicine analyse and unmask this violence. This special issue will
explore Gothic representations of the way medical practice controls,
classifies and torments the body in the service of healing.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Essays could address any of the following in any period,
eighteenth-century to the present:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">· Medical discourse as
itself Gothic (e.g., metaphors in medical writing; links between case
histories and the Gothic tradition), and/or reflections on how specific
medical discourses have shaped Gothic literary forms<br>
· Illness narratives and the Gothic (e.g., using Arthur Frank&#8217;s &#8216;chaos
narratives&#8217; of helplessness in The Wounded Storyteller).<br>
· Literary texts about medical processes as torture/torment in specific
historical and geographic contexts (including contemporary contexts)<br>
· Doctors or nurses represented in literature as themselves Gothic
&#8216;victims&#8217;, constrained by their medical environment<br>
· Genetic testing; organ harvest; genetic engineering; reproductive
technologies; limb prostheses; human cloning, and more.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
            </div>
To date the links between Gothic and psychiatric medical discourse have
been the most thoroughly explored, so preference will be given to
articles exploring other, non-psychiatric medical contexts in the
interests of opening up new connections.<br>

The official journal of the International Gothic Studies Association
considers the field of Gothic studies from the eighteenth century to
the present day. The aim of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gothic
Studies</span>
is not merely to open a forum for dialogue and cultural criticism, but
to provide a specialist journal for scholars working in a field which
is today taught or researched in almost all academic establishments.
Gothic Studies invites contributions from scholars working within any
period of the Gothic; interdisciplinary scholarship is especially
welcome, as are readings in the media and beyond the written word.<br>

            <br>
"Given that representation conditions our responses and interpretations
of events, at present, the attempts to control the symbolic space of
discourses about the crisis is dominated by the struggle between the
institutional and financial powers, and a number of counter-discourses
that dispute such a space. The former appeal to regain their hegemonic
place and lost credibility. The latter emerge from social movements
like Occupy Wall Street, Arab Spring, 15-M, etc., that contest those
narratives with grassroots intervention. In such a light, the
representations of the crisis can be regarded as the ground where the
ethical discourses that have become urgent and relevant are being
articulated at the social symbolic level<br>
            <br>
Contributions are welcome that tackle the representation of the global
economic crisis from a cultural perspective in the Arts, film,
literature, journalism, as well as the linguistic, socio-economic,
political, community, or other, dimensions.<br>
Areas of interest would include, but are not limited to:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">- The role of emerging
social movements in shaping alternative discourses.<br>
- The mutation of millenarist or War on terror discourses to collude
with institutional narratives about the crisis.<br>
- The resurgence of popular genres (catastrophe, terror, science
fiction, children's tales) as symptom of social unrest and instability.<br>
- Discourses of realism and reality as opposed to narrativization.<br>
- The language of the media and politics in dealing with the crisis.<br>
- The representation of the crisis as trauma.<br>

            <br>
Studies of early modern English literature and culture have rarely
explored discourses and practices of lying and deception. This issue
will therefore seek new ways of discussing the complex relationship
between truth and falsehood, aiming to rethink the social, cultural and
epistemological underpinnings of mendacity in early modern England (c.
1500-1750). While truth-telling is often assumed to be a universal
paradigm (as attested by the Gricean maxim of quality), the codes of
truth and lying are subject to historical change. What might appear to
be an egregious falsehood at a particular time might seem relatively
benign at another. In early modernity, what were the cultural norms of
truthfulness and lying, and on what basis were they constructed? What
were the consequences when someone did not share the assumed common
project of truth-telling and deliberately tried to avoid telling what
they knew to be the truth, or to claim as true what they knew to be
false? What were the pragmatic (legal, political, social or
gender-based) strictures on mendacious discourse, and which media, art
forms or genres were exempt from these strictures?<br>
            <br>
Contributions may explore but are not restricted to topics such as the
following:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8226; discursive and/or
epistemological foundations of truth and lying in early modern culture
and philosophy;<br>
&#8226; lying in particular genres, discourses, media or art forms; <br>

            <br>
The notion of "the creature(ly)" has historically played a decisive but
under investigated role in negotiating the flexible borders between the
supernatural and human and animal life. This issues proposes to focus
on the literary, cultural, and material histories of the creature(ly).
It wants to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the contested
zone where the natural and the supernatural meet in the modern age; it
also aims to develop the notion of the creature(ly) as a powerful tool
for future analyses of the affects, affinities, and anxieties that have
marked this zone since the advent of modernity, and especially since
Darwin.<br>
            <br>
Contributions can explore, but are not restricted to: <br>
&#8226; how the notion of the creature(ly) has shaped and reflected changing
gender relations and legal institutions of personhood, and has cut
across the binary human/animal.<br>
&#8226; the affinities between the notion of the creature(ly) and the
diachronically related term "creativity," which places the notion at
the heart of modern conceptions of authorship and anxieties about
artificial creation.<br>
&#8226; the religious resonances in the notion of the creature(ly); its
relation to religious notions of Creation and the Creator and political
theological approaches.<br>
&#8226; postcolonial and gender dimensions of the ways in which the notion of
the creature(ly), like that of the monstrous, has historically served
to police the borders of Western subjectivity. <br>
&#8226; the relations between animal, human, and supernatural life in popular
culture and children&#8217;s literature.<br>
&#8226; the ways in which these relations have been shaped (and often
triggered) by scientific discourses and practices, and have been
sedimented in a broad range of material practices (like zoos).<br>
            <br>

Bapsi Sidhwa, author of the South Asian partition classic <span style="font-style: italic;">Ice-Candy Man</span> aka <span style="font-style: italic;">Cracking India,</span>
has famously said 'memory demands poetic license'. This issue invites
contributions that work to develop a 'poetics' of partition by
considering the<span style="font-style: italic;"> licentia poetica</span>
of the diverse literary and cultural productions relating to the
partitions of South Asia and Cyprus.&nbsp; Both South Asia and Cyprus
experienced partitions and exchanges of populations in their
transitions from British colonialism to post-colonial nation-states,
yet have seldom been studied in counterpoint in the same
context.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
The issue thus queries: how is cultural memory formed in the afterlife
of a partition, and what is the role of post-memory and prosthetic
memory? How do people remember the world prior to partition, and how
does this process shape possibilities for the future? What is the
relationship between nation-state forms of memory, diasporic
imaginaries, and cultural and personal memory for the victims of
partition? What license has been taken and to what effect to re-imagine
ways of being in the world in film, fiction, poetry, memoir, and&nbsp;
testimony and how do these unsettle ideas and feelings of home/land,
nation and community, or other ways of belonging?&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
Contributions may focus on either of the regions; transregional and
comparative perspectives are also welcome. Please note that the
deadline for proposals for all issues of this volume is 31 October

            <br>
Fiction narratives, films, documentaries and TV series dealing with
Muslim issues have increased notably since the events of 9/11, most of
them with reference to Islamist terrorism. Whether triggered by 9/11
attacks or not, Islamic characters in literature and film often embody
the problematic role of the 'Other' and are usually forced into a
stereotype designed from a Western biased perspective as an epitome of
fundamentalism and hatred versus the civilization and modernity
represented by white, wealthy westerners. Narratives like Hanif
Kureishi's<span style="font-style: italic;"> My Son the Fanatic</span>
(1994) and its 1997 film version, Monica Ali's <span style="font-style: italic;">Brick Lane</span> (2004) and its 2007 film
version, Jonathan Safran Foer's <span style="font-style: italic;">Extremely
Loud and Incredibly Close</span> (2005) and its 2011 film version, John
Updike's <span style="font-style: italic;">Terrorist</span> (2006),
Kiran Nagarkar's <span style="font-style: italic;">God Little Soldier </span>(2006),
Don DeLillo's <span style="font-style: italic;">Falling Man </span>(2007),
Mohsin Hamid's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Reluctant
Fundamentalist</span> (2008) and its 2012 film version, Tabish Khair's <span style="font-style: italic;">How to Fight Islamist Terror from the
Missionary Position</span> (2012), or Mohammad Hanif's <span style="font-style: italic;">Our Lady of Alice Bhatti</span> (2012) are
only some examples of a wider rich literary exploration.<br>
Along with literature, films, documentaries and TV series as <span style="font-style: italic;">Kurbaan</span> (2009), <span style="font-style: italic;">My Name is Khan</span> (2010), <span style="font-style: italic;">Saving Face</span> (2004), <span style="font-style: italic;">Homeland</span> (2011) or <span style="font-style: italic;">Little Mosque on the Prairie</span>
(2007), among many others, also attempt to offer (or fail to do so) an
insight about the kaleidoscopic and multifold nature of Muslim
identity. Western constructions are also contested and challenged by
intellectuals, academicians and scholars in what has come to be one of
the defining 21st century issues: Fred Halliday's 'Islamophobia
Reconsidered' (1999), Noam Chomsky's <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Culture of Terrorism </span>(1999), Ziauddin Sardar and Merryl Wyn
Davies' <span style="font-style: italic;">Why Do People Hate America?</span>
(2002), John E. Richardson's <span style="font-style: italic;">(Mis)Representing
Islam: The Racism and Rhetoric of British Broadsheet Newspapers</span>
(2004), Samir Kassir's <span style="font-style: italic;">Being Arab </span>(2006),
Robert Fisk's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Great War for
Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East</span> (2007), or Tabish
Khair's <span style="font-style: italic;">Muslim Modernities</span>
(2008) display, inter alia, multifarious approaches to this issue.<br>
            <br style="font-style: italic;">
            <span style="font-style: italic;">The Journal of

(Allahabad, India) seeks contributions for its next issue (December
2013) that will expand our current understanding of the complex nature
of Muslim identities within the international geopolitical and
sociological situation through a variety of critical stances. Prompting
scholars to engage with connections between history, economics,
literature, society, religion, etc., this journal invites articles
devoted to the analysis of how Muslim identities are shaped, dealt
with, investigated and problematized both in narratives and the screen
by fostering multifaceted approaches. Prospective themes are:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">- post-9/11 trauma
narratives and film<br>
- Muslim social struggle after 9/11<br>
- fighting stereotypes in the multi-ethnic classroom after 9/11<br>
- re-visiting terrorist tragedies<br>
- radical Islam and the radical ?Other?<br>
- diasporic Muslim identities<br>
- Western vs Eastern victimhood<br>
- collective memory/history<br>

The official journal of the International Gothic Studies Association
considers the field of Gothic studies from the eighteenth century to
the present day. The aim of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gothic
Studies</span>
is not merely to open a forum for dialogue and cultural criticism, but
to provide a specialist journal for scholars working in a field which
is today taught or researched in almost all academic establishments.
Gothic Studies invites contributions from scholars working within any
period of the Gothic; interdisciplinary scholarship is especially
welcome, as are readings in the media and beyond the written word.<br>
For more information on <span style="font-style: italic;">Gothic

Television has long been considered the visual medium where writers
continue to hold sway over the director/auteur who dominates the silver
screen. For reasons that perhaps stem from the burgeoning industry of
screenwriter's seminars and screenwriting handbooks, increasing
attention has been paid to the structure of television writing:
showrunners like Dan Harmon (creator and once and future showrunner of <span style="font-style: italic;">Community</span>)
expose their Propp-like schematics of episode-writing to an avid
audience, while the Sundance channel has followed in the footsteps of
Orange's documentary series Showrunners with its own documentary series
on television writers, The Writer's Room. How does the traditionally
collaborative writing process of the American television series combine
with the auteurist vision of television present since <span style="font-style: italic;">David Chase</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Sopranos </span>became a household
name?<br>
The Emmy nominations announced on July 18, 2013, were unusual in
heralding not only the best and brightest in television, but also the
storytelling innovations that television has been showcasing in recent
years. By nominating Netflix's <span style="font-style: italic;">House
of Cards</span>,
whose entire first season was made available on the VOD service,
Hollywood acknowledged the changes in the way television is made,
packaged, and enjoyed: the serialized narratives that have become
relatively standard in recent years no longer require the viewer to
'tune in next week.' Instead, streaming, DVD, and VOD services now
allow for marathon viewings that demand increasingly complex narratives
to satisfy sustained and / or repeated viewings. It seems therefore an
appropriate time to reexamine the narrative strategies employed in a
new golden age for American television.<br>
            <br>
Topics could include:<br>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">*Structure: the television
series has evolved in recent years, both in its beginnings, and its
endings (for example with the generalization of the cold open, or the
efforts made to truly conclude a series rather than have it simply end).<br>
*Defining one's terms: with efforts like <span style="font-style: italic;">Buffy the Vampire Slayer </span>Season 8
(in comic book format) and Richard Castle's Nikki Heat books appearing
in bookstores, where does diegesis end?<br>
*Problems of seriality and television narrative: how has televisions
attitude towards seriality changed, and how does the television writer
satisfy the weekly viewer, the binge viewer, and the repeat viewer? Has
the traditional structure of writing in acts and its perpetuations been
called into question -- for example in premium cable offerings, where
commercial breaks are no longer an issue?<br>
*Frame narratives: to what extent has the return of the often ironic
narrator, from <span style="font-style: italic;">Sex in the City</span>
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Desperate Housewives</span>,
hailed a similarly ironic distance from the diegesis? What has been the
cultural impact of the suggestive use of analepse and prolepse in a
series like <span style="font-style: italic;">Lost</span>?<br>
*Self-referential television: does quality television necessarily refer
to itself, as Robert J. Thompson once suggested, and has this tendency
increased in recent years?<br>

We invite submissions for a proposed essay collection concerning the

during the long nineteenth century. Essays might address gendered
travel, narratives determinedly off the beaten paths, Byronic or other
'celebrity' tourism, commercialization and mass tourism, genre
challenges and boundaries, and the intersections of tourism and travel
in many different avenues. Essays will consider the variety of ways in
which writers responded to the opening of borders and their
accompanying crossings throughout the century, as well as the ways in
which familiarity with such Continental landscapes mutated with the
development of texts and culture at home and abroad. <br>

invite contributions on the theme of Neo-Victorian Humour for the fifth
volume in Rodopi's Neo-Victorian Series, to be published in 2015. This
edited collection will examine the manifold modes, functions, and
implications of humour across neo-Victorian media, such as literature,
film, anime, graphic novels, videogames, visual art, performance and
lifestyle (e.g. steampunk). The volume will explore neo-Victorianism in
the light of contemporary aesthetics as the art of indirect speech,
what Umberto Eco famously described as "accept[ing] the challenge of
the past, of the already said&#8221; to &#8220;consciously and with pleasure play
the game of irony" (Eco, <span style="font-style: italic;">Reflections
on The Name of the Rose,</span>
1994) -- but also to engage in more aggressive games of parody,
aesthetic travesty, confrontation and denunciation. The omnipresence of
a humorous awareness tends to insist on a crucial difference and
distance between neo-Victorianism and its nineteenth-century referent,
thus seemingly arguing against a nostalgic stance. Yet humorous devices
can also be employed to recycle invidious ideologies (e.g. racism,
imperialism, classism, sexism) under the politically correct guise of
comical debunking or subversion, even to the point of carrying forward
a pro-nostalgic agenda. From a technical point of view, humour also
implies the establishment of a complicity with the audience, involving
readers/viewers in complex games that may finally have less bearing on
the diegetic world than on the textual, intertextual and metatextual
nineteenth-century worlds being re-imagined. We encourage chapters to
investigate the inherent contradictions of neo-Victorian humour's aims
and&nbsp; effects, both as a means of self-consciously creative
experimentation and&nbsp; adaptation of historical events, figures, and
artefacts and as a self-defeating&nbsp; nihilistic or anti-historical
project.<br>

experimental out of despair' (Raymond Federman)<br>
            <br>
'Literature is news that STAYS news' (Ezra Pound)<br>
            <br>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">Experimental
literature, in its broadest sense, might be said to ask the following
question: what more can fiction do than it currently does? It is a
consideration that inevitably discloses both a sense of dissatisfaction
with what we have, and a trusting optimism in the future&#8217;s ability to
deliver new possibilities. The experimental has connotations of risk,
excitement, innovation, and aesthetic progressiveness, but it also
frequently contains a knowledge of its own possible failure: an
awareness that experiments by their nature might go badly wrong.
Experimental fiction is a series of attempts at change, and yet the
last sixty years of literary history has been marked by an anxiety
about its own possible exhaustion (John Barth). What if all
experimentation has already been tried? Both the experimental, and its
close relation the avant-garde, look forward &#8211; a potentially
problematic stance given a contemporary scene that is preoccupied with
its own &#8216;post&#8217;ness. Indeed, as Brian McHale has recently asked, can the
literature of the postmodern be experimental at all?<br>
Both the avant-garde and the experimental thus bear a combative
relation to what has gone before, and to literary history as a whole.
The avant-garde contains the promise of both an aesthetic and a
political radicalness: remembering the term&#8217;s military etymology, we
are cognizant of the neo or contemporary avant-garde&#8217;s aggressive
potential. Perhaps for this reason, experimental or avant-garde fiction
often rubs people (readers, critics) up the wrong way: it implies
there&#8217;s something wrong what we already have, and seeks to usurp it. It
refuses consolation, recuperation, all of the dulling and soporific
effects of traditional narrative, and is subsequently accused,
variously, of self-indulgence, political quiescence and solipsism.
Sometimes it is too political -- the history of the avant-garde in the
twentieth-century, especially French 'literature of commitment'
(littérature engagée) -- and sometimes it is not political enough --
the characterization of experimental writers and audiences as aloof,
anti-reader literary elites. Itself a marginal mode, experimental
literature has obvious affiliations with other types of writing that
have been pushed out, overlooked or ignored by the mainstream, in
particular women&#8217;s writing. Nevertheless, as Christine Brooke-Rose has
noted, many experimental novels are 'surprisingly phallocentric'. Does
the stylistically experimental necessarily imply the politically
subversive?<br>
Experimental as a term is unavoidably evaluative: either as a synonym
for unsuccessful, unreadable, or elitist; or with its positive but
equally problematic associations of progressiveness and intellectual
ambition. In its positive incarnation it contains an implicit
condemnation of everything that is not experimental; it creates its own
version of what it subverts or moves on from, conceiving the
non-experimental as a homogenous mass. Keeping in mind Rita Felski's
warning that those critics 'who proclaim the subversive power of formal
experimentation, fail to consider that the breaking of conventions
itself becomes conventional', we ask whether the paradox inherent in
the canonization of experimental and avant-garde fiction means that
postmodernism has incorporated and recuperated it to the detriment of
experimental literature&#8217;s ability to fulfil its remit: that, is, as Eva
Figes put it, 'What matters is that the writer should shock into
awareness, startle, engage the attention: above all that he should not
engage in the trade of reassurance.'<br>

Michele Roberts gathered around Patsy Stoneman at Haworth in Yorkshire
to talk about the influence that the Brontës had had on their
evolutions as authors, and more generally, about the source of
inspiration that the most famous family of writers in England could
represent. Patsy Stoneman had already tackled the topic by publishing a
book entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">The Brontë
Influence</span> in 2004 with the help of Charmian Knight. The issue of
            <span style="font-style: italic;">LISA e-journal</span>
"Re-Writing Jane Eyre: Jane Eyre, Past and Present" is further evidence
of Charlotte Brontë's influence on the writers of the following
decades or centuries. So far, these studies have been quite limited and
this field of research, "the Brontë influence", offers a wide
range of possible developments.<br>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Moreover, if the four
authors' poetry and novels have already been the
object of numerous studies, there is much left to write about the
influences which were exerted on the Brontës, whether religious,
literary, philosophical or cultural. Taking account of the context
of&nbsp; a work is often a good way of understanding the issues
underlying a text: the path taken by the Brontës, their journeys,
their stays abroad, the books they read, etc. could prove to be very
enlightening. Besides these external factors, one could also consider
the interactions between the three sisters, who wrote in the same room
and who read passages from their works aloud.<br>
A final aspect to identify and study could be the influences which are
exerted within the Brontës' works themselves. How can one account
for the progress of the heroes and heroines? How is the influence that
characters have on one another expressed? What role does nature play in
the destiny of characters? Which other elements intervene in the novels?<br>
            <br>
This dossier devoted to the Brontës intends to analyse the works
through the perspective of influence and three different fields of
research can thus be considered:<br>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Are literary scholars and
critics supposed to voice their view on
normative questions within their academic writings? How far should
world views, political opinions and evaluations enter into the
scholarly and critical work with literary texts? Is it even possible to
exclude such judgements from literary studies? How and why do different
traditions of literary studies treat these problems divergently?<br>

controversy by Peter J. Rabinowitz and Marshall W. Gregory, which can
