  Our 1995 Saab 900SE turbo convertible project. The goal of the project
  was not to build a supercar, but to grow a car that's a easy to live
  with. It had to be reliable, fast, have predictable handling and good
  everyday drivability -- all those qualities that would let us enjoy it
  for a few summers to come.
  <P>
  Some of the key steps were to improve the chassis by installing better
  suspension components, reinforcing the steering and tightening up the
  body. The engine has been rebuilt for larger displacement
  (the proven Saab 2.3L design) and tuned for higher output with a
  custom Nordic stage4 ECU. This in
  turn called for a newer and stronger gearbox and a clutch to match.
  <P>
  The exterior remains largely untouched, except for later style transparent
  blinkers and removed chrome bumper strips. There are no plans for installing
  any body kits or otherwise enhancing the appearance of the car. It will
  remain stock from the outside. Period.
  <P>
  Another point of the project was to use only off-shelf parts that are
  easy to find, install and replace. Having no custom built hardware
  could also serve as an example of what could be achieved within a
  short timeframe on a reasonable budget and be a guide and inspiration
  to others. We maintain a complete
  <A HREF="http://www.platonoff.com/auto/log3.xtp">upgrade and service log</A>
  explaining every bit of work performed on the car, as well as
  maintenance, expenses and other related items.

    The summer's near, and here's a great way to celebrate it:
    a 1995 Saab 900SE turbo convertible. The car came from a local auction,
    with the body and interior in
    <A HREF="20060408.Original_Condition/">surprisingly good shape</A>.
    Unfortunately, it was not that good mechanically. It needed work in
    many areas, including the engine, transmission, suspension and soft top.
    Therefore the goal of this project was to build a better Saab convertible.

    The work started with <A HREF="20060506.Interior/">interior</A>.
    The seats and dashboard were removed, the side panels and carpeting
    stripped. The next step would be to clean everything up and prepare for
    soundproofing and audio upgrade.

    <A HREF="20060509.Suspension/">Suspension removal</A>. The front end is
    up on stands, the wheels are off, and the front struts together with
    suspension arms and calipers are being removed from the car. Then I find
    that I need to fiddle with the soft top to get to the rear shock towers,
    and finally the whole rear axle meets the floor.

    <A HREF="20060512.Powertrain/">Powertrain disassembly</A>. The headlights,
    grille and bumper come off to allow the access to the intercooler. The
    intercoler is then removed with all the pipes, and the airbox follows it.
    The exhaust system is easy to remove as it's held together with only
    rubber hangers and clam clamps. The gearbox gets unbolted from the engine
    and lowered to the floor. And finally, the engine comes out with a help
    of a friend and a 3-ton shop crane.

    The engine is <A HREF="20060512.Powertrain/#20060528b.Out_of_the_trunk.jpg">being replaced</A> with a
    2.3L block from a Saab 9000 Aero. The replacement engine came from a
    scrap yard, so it first gets stripped, disassembled and sent to an engine
    shop for machining and polishing. All accessories and manifolds are
    also refreshed and cleaned.

    New finish for all kinds of parts: valve cover, engine block, suspension.

    All parts have finally arrived, and the assembly work begun. You can
    see there's a space issue. The garage is pretty tight, so keeping all
    the parts and tools around is a bit of a problem.

    The car is out of the garage for the first time. Engine and suspension
    installation finished, wheels and bumper on. The front seats are installed
    temporarily so the car can be driven. Here's a
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvAFZbok2qY">short
    video <strong>[YouTube]</strong></a> of the car rolling out of the garage.

    Soundproofing is the last step before the final interior assembly.
    A layer of B-Quiet Ultimate sound deadening material is applied on the
    inside of the door and the outer surface, footwells, floor and side panels.

    The stereo system is upgraded with a more powerful four-channel amplifier,
    all new wiring, Infinity Reference component speakers in front doors and on
    the dashboard, and larger speakers in the rear for increased bass output.

    A final shot of the car. It already covered about 5000 km since the rebuild.
    There were zero problems (aside from <A HREF="/Auto/20061014.Saab_NG900_Rear_Springs_Intrax_vs_Eibach/">this
    suspension issue</A>). The car established itself to be solid and reliable, easy to
    drive in everyday traffic, and fast and capable when you want to have fun.

    A torque and horsepower graph from a Dynojet dyno, taken at ambient
    22&deg;C (71&deg;F), 29.4 in-HG. The shop only had a small portable
    fan, which limited the car's performance on the dyno. It only held
    15-16 psi of boost instead of its usual 18-19 psi, and started to drop
    off at just 4300 RPM. As the result, the top figures measured were 246
    whp and 309 ft-lbs at the wheels. Accounting for a 12% drivetrain loss, it
    gives 280 hp and 350 ft-lbs at the crank. The real world performance
    in more favorable conditions is estimated to be around 300-310 hp.

    A four-point roll bar built to
    <a href="http://www.casc.on.ca/">CASC-OR</a> specifications.
    I had to do this to make the car admissible to local driving events and
    high performance driving schools. Fabricated by
    <a href="http://www.cscracing.com/">CSC Racing</a> - one of the best roll
    cage builders in Ontario. It is removable, and fully clears the roof when
    installed. The bar bolts to the floor and the torsion box, and only
    requires the removal of rear interior panels to fit.
