		<p class="MsoList" align="center">AN INTRODUCTION TO THE CHIEF WRITERS 
		OF ENGLAND AND AMERICA, TO THE BOOKS THEY WROTE, AND TO THE TIMES IN 
		WHICH THEY LIVED</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/clemens.jpg" width="129" height="180" alt="Samuel Clemens"> </p>
		<p align="center">BY WILLIAM J. LONG (1866-1952)</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center"><i>This is the wey to al good 
		aventure</i>.CHAUCER</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>PREFACE</h3>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" align="center"><i>The last thing we find in 
		making a book is to know what to put first</i>.Pascal<br>
&nbsp;</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>When an author has finished his history, after 
		months or years of happy work, there comes a dismal hour when he must 
		explain its purpose and apologize for its shortcomings.</p>
			<p>The explanation in this case is very simple and 
		goes back to a personal experience. When the author first studied the 
		history of our literature there was put into his hands as a textbook a 
		most dreary catalogue of dead authors, dead masterpieces, dead 
		criticisms, dead ages; and a boy who knew chiefly that he was alive was 
		supposed to become interested in this literary sepulchre or else have it 
		said that there was something hopeless about him. Later he learned that 
		the great writers of England and America were concerned with life alone, 
		as the most familiar, the most mysterious, the most fascinating thing in 
		the world, and that the only valuable or interesting feature of any work 
		of literature is its vitality.</p>
			<p>To introduce these writers not as dead worthies 
		but as companionable men and women, and to present their living subject 
		as a living thing, winsome as a smile on a human face,--such was the 
		authors purpose in writing this book.</p>
			<p>The apology is harder to frame, as anyone knows 
		who has attempted to gather the writers of a thousand years into a 
		single volume that shall have the three virtues of brevity, readableness 
		and accuracy. That this record is brief in view of the immensity of the 
		subject is plainly apparent. That it may prove pleasantly readable is a 
		hope inspired chiefly by the fact that it was a pleasure to write it, 
		and that pleasure is contagious. As for accuracy, every historian who 
		fears God or regards man strives hard enough for that virtue; but after 
		all his striving, remembering the difficulty of criticism and the 
		perversity of names and dates that tend to error as the sparks fly 
		upward, he must still trust heaven and send forth his work with 
		something of Chaucers feeling when he wrote:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>O littel bookë, thou art so unconning, <br>How darst thou put thy-self in prees for drede?</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Which <i>may</i> mean, to one who appreciates 
		Chaucers wisdom and humor, that having written a little book in what 
		seemed to him an unskilled or unconning way, he hesitated to give it 
		to the world for dread of the prees or crowd of critics who, even in 
		that early day, were wont to look upon each new book as a camel that 
		must be put through the needles eye of their tender mercies.</p>
			<p>In the selection and arrangement of his material 
		the author has aimed to make a usable book that may appeal to pupils and 
		teachers alike. Because history and literature are closely related (one 
		being the record of mans deed, the other of his thought and feeling) 
		there is a brief historical introduction to every literary period. There 
		is also a review of the general literary tendencies of each age, of the 
		fashions, humors and ideals that influenced writers in forming their 
		style or selecting their subject.&nbsp; Then there is a biography of every 
		important author, written not to offer another subject for hero-worship 
		but to present the man exactly as he was; a review of his chief works, 
		which is intended chiefly as a guide to the best reading; and a critical 
		estimate or appreciation of his writings based partly upon first-hand 
		impressions, partly upon the assumption that an author must deal 
		honestly with life as he finds it and that the business of criticism is, 
		as Emerson said, not to legislate but to raise the dead. This detailed 
		study of the greater writers of a period is followed by an examination 
		of some of the minor writers and their memorable works.&nbsp; Finally, each 
		chapter concludes with a concise summary of the period under 
		consideration, a list of selections for reading and a bibliography of 
		works that will be found most useful in acquiring a larger knowledge of 
		the subject.</p>
			<p>In its general plan this little volume is modeled 
		on the authors more advanced <i>English Literature</i> and <i>American 
		Literature</i>; but the material, the viewpoint, the presentation of 
		individual writers,--all the details of the work are entirely new. Such 
		a book is like a second journey through ample and beautiful regions 
		filled with historic associations, a journey that one undertakes with 
		new companions, with renewed pleasure and, it is to be hoped, with 
		increased wisdom. It is hardly necessary to add that our subject has 
		still its unvoiced charms, that it cannot be exhausted or even 
		adequately presented in any number of histories. For literature deals 
		with life; and life, with its endlessly surprising variety in unity, has 
		happily some suggestion of infinity.</p>
			<p>WILLIAM J. LONG<br>STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT</p>
