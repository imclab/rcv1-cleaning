<font size="2">Addicts devote themselves to satisfying some personal desire. They are 
happy when they have their fix, but miserable in withdrawal. "Good" 
addicts, such as music addicts, are harmless, and we ignore them. "Bad" 
addicts are those who hurt others to feed their habit. Society 
prosecutes them-unless their addiction is automobiles. Despite their 
social cost, auto addicts are pampered. For, although cars are 
convenient appliances, they cost dearly. And, while a few cars are 
thrilling to drive and a few are beautiful, cars generally bring danger 
and ugliness.</font></p><p>
<font size="2">
Auto addiction is detrimental to society. But car addicts don't seem to 
care about the downside of their addiction. They are too concerned that 
their car gives them an identity, that it takes them everywhere they 
want to go whenever they wish to go there. Since they are totally 
occupied in living the sort of life that their addiction prescribes, we 
must indicate how we all pay for their addiction. The first place that 
auto addicts hurt us is the pocketbook. Cars are expensive, and consume 
money that would otherwise be spent on something of more lasting value. 
Perverse values are revealed when $50,000 automobiles are as common as 
hungry children.</font></p><p>
<font size="2">
Auto addicts choose to live away from their work, and their long 
commute costs plenty. Auto dependence spreads out the city and 
increases infrastructure cost. Because auto addicts will not use public 
transportation, they require expensive highways.</font></p><p>
<font size="2">
Other costs are less obvious. Valuable land becomes parking lots, and 
its value decreases. Our perfectly good downtown deteriorates as the 
auto addicts drive to suburban malls. "No free parking downtown," they 
complain. To them, "free" means "free to me." Auto addicts do not 
recognize that someone pays for "free" parking. And "free" roads, too. 
In his unnecessarily big and expensive car, the auto addict commutes 
for hours every week. But, commuting is inefficient and unproductive. 
It costs the commuter, the commuter's family, and society.</font></p><p>
<font size="2">
Auto addiction reduces the quality of life. Urban highways are ugly, 
parking lots are ugly. Automobiles offend other senses, too: fumes 
stink, cars pollute the air, they are noisy. Commuters reduce the 
quality of life in communities through which they pass. Inner-city 
residents must either fight to protect their neighborhoods or put up 
with danger, pollution, noise, and unsightliness. The auto addicts lose 
out, too. They lose because commuting is both stressful and isolating. 
Alone in their cars, they have no chance encounters with friends or 
neighbors. These connections are vital to personal and social 
well-being.</font></p><p>
<font size="2">

Auto addiction is a tough problem to solve because the addicts won't 
accept responsibility. A part of being an addict is to hold others 
accountable for the painful results of your habit. When all the car 
freaks exercise their addiction during rush hour, they sometimes create 
a traffic jam. Who do they blame for the jam? Not themselves; not other 
addicts. They blame the city or unyielding communities.</font> </p><p>
<font size="2">

Auto addicts refuse to accept that the traffic problem results from too 
many cars, not from inadequate roads. So, we cannot look to the addict 
to voluntarily cure his or her addiction. However, we can help them to 
consider alternatives. We can restrict the city's expansive growth. We 
can refuse to widen streets where such widening diminishes community 
life. We can protect inner city communities from commuter pollution to 
the extent that we have protected outlying areas.</font> </p><p>
<font size="2">

We can tax auto addicts so they pay for their addiction. We can 
increase gasoline taxes, and we can base registration fees on the size 
of the car being registered. We can make inner-city communities more 
attractive to those who now just drive on by. We can improve our public 
transportation system and be more innovative in improving its quality 
and convenience. Implementing such changes is difficult because there 
are so many auto addicts.</font> </p><p>
<font size="2">

And yet, we must act because a city of auto addicts is not sustainable. 
Sooner or later, auto addiction will end because of its costs, its 
inefficiency, and the ugliness it creates. If we all begin to take the 
cure, we will have a more livable city now and in the future.</font></p><p>
