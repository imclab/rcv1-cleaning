			<h2>George Lucas, California Car Culture, and "The Crash" in '62.</h2>
			
              <em><a name="top"></a>By Richard Ravalli</em> <br>
<br>
The first article about George Lucas was published in the <em>Modesto Bee</em> in 1955 when George Jr. was 11 years old. It was an article  highlighting a newspaper for kids that he created with school friend  Mel Cellini. The next time he made the local press, it was not such a  happy occasion. The <em>Bee</em> reported that he was recovering at the Modesto City Hospital after a horrible car accident on June 12, 1962.<a href="http://graffititribute.com/?page=history#1">1</a> By that year the Lucas family had left their home at 530 Ramona Street  for a walnut ranch house in what is now northern Modesto. George was  heading home, traveling east on Sylvan Road when he was about to turn  left toward his house. Attempting to pass him at high speeds,  17-year-old Frank Ferreira (a fellow Downey High School student)  smashed into Lucas's small Fiat Bianchina, flipping the car several  times before it crashed into a tree. Lucas was thrown from the car,  helping save his life, although he was injured badly. He had minor  fractures but his lungs were hemorrhaging. Soon thereafter, he awoke  and began recovering. The <em>Bee</em> article vividly displayed the mangled Fiat.<a href="http://graffititribute.com/?page=history#2">2</a> <br>
<br>
The document signals Lucas's experience with California car culture.  The state was an early leader in the modern American fascination with  the power and art of the automobile. Hot rodding began to form as a  favorite southern California pastime by the late 1930s. Model T's and  A's were "souped up" for greater performance as the local landscape  provided ample testing ground. Scholar John DeWitt writes, <br>
<br>
<blockquote>Early rodders in California were able to perfect their rods  and push them to their limits because they had easy access to flat, dry  lake beds in unpopulated desert areas, a relatively safe environment  for high-speed runs that were almost impossible to find in the rest of  the country. The weather helped too. Topless and fenderless roadsters  weren't very practical in the Pacific Northwest or northern New  England. ...[A]s more rodders appeared on the streets of Pasadena,  Bakersfield, Bellflower and Modesto, there were inevitable challenges.  Even an hour's drive to a lake bed was too far to go to settle things,  so drag racing ("racing on the main drag," one of several possible  etymologies for the term) became more prevalent.<a href="http://graffititribute.com/?page=history#3">3</a> </blockquote>
 Customizer Gene Winfield opened his first shop in Modesto in 1946  called Windy's Custom Shop. From here he connected with southern  California enthusiasts and racers and began competing at El Mirage and  Bonneville.<a href="http://graffititribute.com/?page=history#4">4</a> Gene eventually relocated south and over the years has produced a  number of works for the movie and television industry. Yet his story is  one evidence of the deep connection that exists between Modesto and the  California car culture, a connection that over the years has ultimately  produced many memorable moments in American popular culture. <br>
<br>
Economic and cultural shifts following World War II influenced the "greaser" youth rebel by the 1950s, and powerful and <em>flashy</em> cars became a vital ingredient in being "cool." George Lucas was  certainly caught up in such trends. Unhappy with the move to the ranch  when he was 15, Lucas became more withdrawn and listened to rock and  roll music. He grew his hair long and slicked it back. George Sr.  bought him his first car, the Fiat, and Lucas soon thereafter modified  the "sewing machine" motor and strengthened the suspension.<a href="http://graffititribute.com/?page=history#5">5</a> An amateur racing life followed at regional venues like Laguna Seca.  When not tearing up the tracks and streets (and getting ticketed),  Lucas spent many weekends cruising, which included circling the popular  loop through 10th and 11th Streets in downtown Modesto. Dad was not  pleased with his wayward son.<a href="http://graffititribute.com/?page=history#6">6</a> <br>
<br>
The iconic "James Dean rebel" in Lucas is evident in the 1962 <em>Bee</em> article. Public anxieties over children born in the Depression and  raised during wartime led to a variety of concerns about juvenile  delinquency, nationally as well as in the Golden State. The film  industry exploited the fears emanating from the California suburbs with  1955's <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>, starring actor James Dean as  southern California delinquent Jim Stark. His character survives an  automotive game of "chicken" but Dean himself was not so lucky, dying  in a wreck on his way to Salinas three days before the opening of the  movie.<a href="http://graffititribute.com/?page=history#7">7</a> <em>American Graffiti</em> draws upon both <em>Rebel's</em> and Lucas's dramatic experiences for its climactic accident scene near  the end of the film, offering the Modesto car crash a place in Lucas  lore almost equal to the mystique bestowed on the late actor's tragedy.<a href="http://graffititribute.com/?page=history#8">8</a> (The Dean-Lucas connection is furthered by the name of Lucas's adopted son Jett, named for Dean's character Jett Rink in <em>Giant</em>.<a href="http://graffititribute.com/?page=history#9">9</a> ) Such a relation is just one illustration of the ties between Lucas  and popular themes involving postwar California adolescents. It is part  of a call for closer inspection of the symbiotic connections linking  him and the "Golden Youth" discussed by historian Kirse Granat May in  her fascinating study <em>Golden State, Golden Youth: The California Image in Popular Culture, 1955-1966</em>. <br>
<br>
Just as Jim Stark reformed his ways in <em>Rebel</em>,  whatever sense of seriousness and responsibility that stuck with George  from his dad's strict upbringing manifested after the crash. Feeling  more than a bit lucky to be alive, Lucas made a decision to  straighten-up and focus on less dangerous career goals. As Dale Pollock  quotes him, "The accident made me more aware of myself and my feelings.  I began to trust my instincts. I had the feeling that I should go to  college, and I did."<a href="http://graffititribute.com/?page=history#10">10</a> He attended Modesto Junior College and graduated with an Associate of  Arts degree in 1964. The University of Southern California then called,  where Lucas officially began his career in film. <em>Leaving home</em> is as much a part of <em>American Graffiti</em> as the joy of being there, and in many ways that journey for the film's  director started on a fateful day in June of 1962. Historical "what  if's" abound, but the image of a small car wrapped around a Modesto  tree stands out as a pivotal moment in the past without which the  course of American film and popular culture at the turn of the 21st  century may have been significantly altered. <br>

<a name="5">5</a>If Lutz is correct, Lucas's small import vehicle, like Dustin Hoffman's Alfa Romeo Spyder in 1967's <em>The Graduate</em>,  may signify an early countercultural spark in the future filmmaker,  mirroring a California-inflected rebellious, creative spirit. See Lutz,  53. <br>
