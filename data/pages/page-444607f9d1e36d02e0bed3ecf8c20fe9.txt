<hr><P><a href="oes_abo.htm">About May 2012 National, State, Metropolitan, and Nonmetropolitan Area Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates</a></P>
<p>These estimates are calculated with data collected from employers in all industry sectors, all metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, and all states and the District of Columbia.
</p>
<p>The percentile wage estimate is the value of a wage below which a certain percent of workers fall.
 The median wage is the 50th percentile wage estimate--50 percent of workers earn less than the median and 50 percent of workers earn more than the median.
 <a HREF="/oes/oes_perc.htm">More about percentile wages.</a></p>
<br>
<P id="(1)">(1) Estimates for detailed occupations do not sum to the totals because the totals include occupations not shown separately. Estimates do not include self-employed workers.</P>
<P id="(2)">(2) Annual wages have been calculated by multiplying the hourly mean wage by a &quot;year-round, full-time&quot; hours figure of 2,080 hours; 
for those occupations where there is not an hourly mean wage published, the annual wage has been directly calculated from the reported survey data.</P>
<P id="(3)">(3) The relative standard error (RSE) is a measure of the reliability of a survey statistic. The smaller the relative standard error, the more precise the estimate.</P>
<P id="(9)">(9) The location quotient is the ratio of the area concentration of occupational employment to the national average concentration.
A location quotient greater than one indicates the occupation has a higher share of employment than average, and a location quotient less than one indicates the occupation is less prevalent in the area than average.  </P>
