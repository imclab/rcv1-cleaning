<p><strong>Literary reading on the rise for first time in history of Arts Endowment survey</strong> </p>
<p> <strong>January 12, 2009 </strong> </p>
<p><em>Washington, D.C.</em> -- For the first time in more than 25 years, American
  adults are reading more literature, according to a new study by the National
  Endowment for the Arts. Reading on the Rise documents a definitive increase
  in rates and numbers of American adults who read literature, with the biggest
  increases among young adults, ages 18-24. This new growth reverses two decades
  of downward trends cited previously in NEA reports such as Reading at Risk
  and To Read or Not To Read.</p>
<p>&quot;At a time of immense cultural pessimism, the NEA is pleased to announce
  some important good news. Literary reading has risen in the U.S. for the first
  time in a quarter century,&quot; said NEA Chairman Dana Gioia. &quot;This
  dramatic turnaround shows that the many programs now focused on reading, including
  our own Big Read, are working. Cultural decline is not inevitable.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the key findings:</p>
<p><strong>Literary reading increases </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>For the first time in the history of the survey - conducted
    five times since 1982 - the overall rate at which adults read literature
    (novels and short stories, plays, or poems) rose by seven percent. </li>
  <li>The absolute number of literary readers has grown significantly.
    There were 16.6 million more adult readers of literature in 2008. The growth
    in new readers reflects higher adult reading rates combined with overall
    population growth.</li>
  <li>The 2008 increases followed significant declines in reading rates
    for the two most recent ten-year survey periods (1982-1992 and 1992-2002).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demographics of literature readers</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Young adults show the most rapid increases in literary reading.  Since
      2002, 18-24 year olds have seen the biggest increase (nine percent) in
      literary reading, and the most rapid rate of increase (21 percent).  This
      jump reversed a 20 percent rate of decline in the 2002 survey, the steepest
      rate of decline since the NEA survey began. </li>
  <li>Since 2002, reading has increased at the sharpest rate (+20 percent)
    among Hispanic Americans, Reading rates have increased among African Americans
    by 15 percent, and among Whites at an eight percent rate of increase.</li>
  <li>For
      the first time in the survey's history, literary reading
      has increased among both men and women. Literary reading rates have grown
      or held steady for adults of all education levels. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Trends in media and literary preferences</strong> </p><ul>
  <li>Fiction (novels and short stories) accounts for the new growth in
    adult literary readers.</li>
  <li>Reading poetry and drama continues to decline, especially poetry-reading
    among women.</li>
  <li>Online readers also report reading books. Eighty-four percent of
    adults who read literature (fiction, poetry, or drama) on or downloaded from
    the Internet also read books, whether print or online.</li>
  <li>Nearly 15 percent of all U.S. adults read literature online in 2008.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A tale of two Americas</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>The U.S. population now breaks into two almost equally sized groups &ndash; readers
    and non-readers.</li>
  <li>A slight majority of American adults now read literature (113 million)
    or books (119 million) in any format. </li>
  <li>Reading is an important indicator of positive individual and social
    behavior patterns. Previous NEA research has shown that literary readers
    volunteer, attend arts and sports events, do outdoor activities, and exercise
    at higher rates than non-readers. </li>
</ul>
<p>The NEA research brochure <em>Reading on the Rise</em> is based on early results
  from the 2008 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA). SPPA is a
  periodic survey that has been conducted five times since 1982 using data obtained
  in partnership with the United States Census Bureau. Detailed results from
  the 2008 survey will be available in 2009. The 2008 SPPA survey has a sample
  size of more than 18,000 adults. The 2008 survey's literary reading questions
  - which form the focus of <em>Reading on the Rise</em> - were the same as
  in previous years: &quot;During
  the last 12 months, did you read any a) novels or short stories; b) poetry;
  or c) plays?&quot; Since 1992, the survey also has asked about book-reading.
  In 2008, the survey introduced new questions about reading preferences and
  reading on the Internet. </p>
<p><strong>NEA literature initiatives</strong> </p>
<p>The issue of declining reading rates has been addressed by a number of public
  and private initiatives. The Arts Endowment has embraced the challenge with
  a range of programs to promote reading among young audiences. In 2003, the
  NEA launched Shakespeare in American Communities, the largest tour of Shakespeare
  in American history, reaching more than 21 million students through performances
  and educational resources. The Big Read, a partnership with the Institute of
  Museum and Library Services, encourages communities to read, discuss, and celebrate
  selections from American and world literature. Poetry Out Loud: National Poetry
  Recitation Contest has introduced thousands of high school students nationwide
  to classic and contemporary poetry through this dynamic recitation competition. </p>
<p><strong>NEA research resources</strong> </p>
<p>Since 1976, the NEA Office of Research &amp; Analysis has issued periodic
  research reports, brochures, and notes on topics affecting arts and cultural
  policy and matters of vital interest to artists and arts organizations. Most
  recently, the NEA has produced reports on nonprofit theater, artist employment
  trends, and the arts and civic engagement. <em>Reading on the Rise</em>, along
  with other NEA research, is available for download at <a href="http://www.nea.gov/research">www.nea.gov/research</a>. </p>
