    <summary>The University of Birmingham has won a £6m grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) to create a new Centre for Cryogenic Energy Storage, which will be housed on the University's campus. The 'liquid air' technology could revolutionise the storage of energy, reducing the costs of integrating intermittent generation into the electricity system and ensuring power is available when it is most needed. The funding is part of an investment of £85 million to support university research announced by David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science.</summary>

    <summary>Scientists at the University of Birmingham have found a way of triggering the release of a powerful 'spider's web' of disease-fighting DNA in the body's protective white blood cells. Researchers in the School of Dentistry used Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) to produce the webs, known as NETS (neutrophil extracellular traps), from the white blood cells of patients who have a condition in which their cells are unable to produce NETs naturally. The findings are reported in the journal Clinical and Experimental Immunology.</summary>

Professor Pranab K. Das from the University of Birmingham (previously from the University of Amsterdam) is currently working with the Institute of Lauro Souza Lima (ILSL) in Bauru, São Paulo, and with the Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam to reduce the risk of nerve damage caused by leprosy.  If left untreated this nerve damage leads to disability.</summary>

    <summary>An international team of asteroseismologists, led by the University of Birmingham, has used data from the NASA Kepler Mission to sample the 'stellar music' of 500 stars similar to the Sun, according to research published today (7 April 2011) in the journal Science. The team used the information from these natural resonances, which is coded in pulses of starlight, to measure the properties of the stars and will now be able to compare their findings with predictions based on models of the Milky Way galaxy.</summary>

It is an idea inspired by cowboy movies, but in reality it's more useful for avoiding oncoming traffic. Funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Wellcome Trust, the research is published today (03 February 2010) in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.</summary>

    <summary>Treating suspected cases of swine flu with tamiflu in patients who are otherwise healthy provides no real benefit, according to researchers at the University of Birmingham.In research published on bmj.com, Professor Nick Freemantle and Dr Melanie Calvert found that oseltamivir, or tamiflu, the drug used to treat the H1N1 stain of the flu virus, does not necessarily prevent complications of the virus in otherwise healthy patients. It may, they conclude, have a very modest effect on reducing symptoms, but that benefit is small and the side effects and safety of the drug should be considered.</summary>

    <summary>Engineers at the University of Birmingham, with local company, Ntec, have invented a new casting process that could reduce the energy costs of light-metal foundries.  The technology, called CRIMSON, means that foundries need only heat the quantity of metal required to fill a single mould rather than whole batches that use unnecessary energy and create waste.</summary>
