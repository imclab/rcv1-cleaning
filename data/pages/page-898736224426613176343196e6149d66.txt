      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is no universally accepted definition 
        of art. Although commonly used to describe something of <b>beauty</b>, 
        or a skill which produces an <b>aesthetic</b> result, there is no clear 
        line in principle between (say) a unique piece of handmade sculpture, 
        and a mass-produced but visually attractive item. We might say that art 
        requires thought - some kind of creative impulse - but this raises more 
        questions: for example, how much thought is required? If someone flings 
        paint at a canvas, hoping by this action to create a work of art, does 
        the result automatically constitute art?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even the notion of 'beauty' raises obvious 
        questions. If I think my kid sister's unmade bed constitutes something 
        'beautiful', or aesthetically pleasing, does that make it art? If not, 
        does its status change if a million people happen to agree with me, but 
        my kid sister thinks it is just a pile of clothes?</font></p>

        &quot;Visual Arts&quot;, &quot;Decorative Arts&quot;, &quot;Applied Arts&quot;,

        painting, sculpture (inc. ceramic sculpture), &quot;glass art&quot;, &quot;metal 
        art&quot;, &quot;illuminated gospel manuscripts&quot;, &quot;aerosol art&quot;, 
        &quot;fine art photography&quot;, &quot;animation&quot;, and so on. Sub-categories 
        include: painting in oils, watercolours, acrylics; sculpture in bronze, 
        stone, wood, porcelain; to name but a tiny few. Other sub-branches include 
        different <b>genre</b> <b>categories</b>, like: narrative, portrait, genre-works, 
        landscape, still life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition, entirely <b>new forms of art</b> 
        have emerged during the 20th century, such as: <a href="assemblage-art.htm">assemblage</a>, 
        conceptualism, <a href="collage.htm">collage</a>, earthworks, <a href="installation-art.htm">installation</a>, 
        graffiti, and video, as well as the broad conceptualist movement which

        that art reflects and belongs to the <b>period</b> and <b>culture</b> 
        from which it is spawned.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After all, how can we compare prehistoric

        art</a>, or native <a href="ancient-art/oceanic.htm">Oceanic art</a>,

        16th century Old Testament frescoes on the walls and ceiling of the Sistine 
        Chapel? Political events are the most obvious era-factors that influence 
        art: for example, art styles like Expressionism, Dada, and Surrealism 
        were products of political uncertainty and upheavals.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cultural differences also act as natural 
        borders. After all, Western draughtsmanship is light years away from Chinese 
        calligraphy; and what Western artform compares with Japanese origami paper 
        art? Religion is a major cultural variable that alters the shape of the 
        artistic envelope. The Baroque style was strongly influenced by the Catholic 
        Counter-Reformation, while <a href="islamic-art.htm">Islamic art</a> (like 
        Orthodox Christianity), forbids certain types of artistic iconography.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In other words, whatever definition of 
        art we arrive at, it is bound to be limited to our era and culture. Even

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you can see from the above, the world 
        of art is a highly complex entity, not only in terms of its multiplicity 
        of forms and types, but also in terms of its historical and cultural roots. 
        Therefore a simple definition, or even a broad consensus as to what can 
        be labelled art, is likely to prove highly elusive.</font></p>

        skills.&quot; Thus Renaissance painters and sculptors were viewed merely 
        as highly skilled artisans (interior-decorators?). No wonder Leonardo 
        Da Vinci and Michelangelo went to such efforts to elevate the status of 
        artists (and by implication art itself) onto a more intellectual plane.</font></p>

        mid-18th century, the mere demonstration of technical skills was insufficient 
        to qualify as art - it now needed an &quot;aesthetic&quot; component - 
        it had to be seen as something &quot;beautiful.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the same time, the concept of &quot;utilitarianism&quot; 
        (functionality or usefulness) was used to distinguish the more noble &quot;fine 
        arts&quot; (art for art's sake), like painting and sculpture, from the 
        lesser forms of &quot;applied art&quot;, such as crafts and commercial 
        <a href="design.htm">design</a> work, and the ornamental &quot;decorative 
        arts&quot;, like textile design and interior design.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thus, by the end of the 19th century, art 
        was separated into at least two broad categories: namely, fine art and 
        the rest - a situation that reflected the cultural snobbery and moral 
        standards of the European establishment. Furthermore, despite some erosion 
        of faith in the aesthetic standards of Renaissance ideology - which remained 
        a powerful influence throughout the world of fine art - even painting 
        and sculpture had to conform to certain aesthetic rules in order to be 
        considered &quot;true art&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="twentiethcentury"></a>Meaning 
        of Art During the Early 20th Century</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then came Cubism (1907-14), which rocked 
        the fine arts establishment to its foundations. Not simply because Picasso 
        introduced a non-naturalistic branch of painting and sculpture, but because 
        it shattered the monotheistic Renaissance approach to how art related 
        to the world around it. Thus, Cubism's main contribution was to act as 
        a sort of catalyst for a host of new movements which greatly expanded 
        the theory and practice of art, such as: Suprematism, Constructivism, 
        Dada, Neo-Plasticism, Surrealism and Conceptualism, as well as various 
        realist styles, such as Social and Socialist Realism. In practice, this 
        proliferation of new styles and artistic techniques led to a new broadening 
        of the meaning and definition of art. In its escape from its &quot;Renaissance 
        straitjacket&quot;, and all the associated rules concerning &quot;objectivity&quot; 
        (eg. on perspective, useable materials, content, composition, and so on), 
        fine art now boasted a significant element of &quot;subjectivity&quot;. 
        Artists suddenly found themselves with far greater freedom to create paintings 
        and sculpture according to their own subjective values. In fact, one might 
        say that from this point &quot;art&quot; started to become &quot;indefinable&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The decorative and applied arts underwent 
        a similar transformation due to the availability of a vastly increased 
        range of commercial products. However, the resultant increase in the number 
        of associated design and crafts disciplines did not have any significant 
        impact on the definition and meaning of art as a whole.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="postwar"></a>Meaning of Art 
        Post-World War II</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The cataclysm of WWII led to the demise 
        of Paris as the capital of world art, and its replacement by New York. 
        This new American orientation encouraged art to become more of a commercial 
        product, and loosen its connection with existing traditions of aestheticism 
        - a trend furthered by the emergence of Abstract Expressionism, Pop-Art, 
        and the activities of the new breed of celebrity artists like Andy Warhol. 
        All of a sudden, even the most mundane items and concepts became elevated 
        to the status of &quot;art&quot;. Under the influence of this populist 
        approach, conceptualists introduced new artforms, like assemblage, installation, 
        video and performance. In due course, graffiti added its own mark, as 
        did numerous styles of reinterpretation, like <a href="history-of-art/neo-dada.htm">Neo-Dada</a>, 
        <a href="history-of-art/neo-expressionism.htm">Neo-Expressionism</a>, 
        and Neo-Pop, to name but three. Schools and colleges of art throughout 
        the world dutifully preached the new polytheism, adding further fuel to 
        the bonfire of <a href="renaissance-art.htm">Renaissance art</a> traditions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="postmodernist"></a>Postmodernism 
        and the Meaning of Art</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The redefinition of art during the last 
        three decades of the 20th century has been lent added intellectual weight 
        by theorists of the postmodernist movement. According to the postmoderns, 
        the focus has shifted from artistic skill to the &quot;meaning&quot; of 
        the work produced. In addition, &quot;how&quot; a work is &quot;experienced&quot; 
        by spectators has become a critical component in its aesthetic value. 
        The phenomenal success of contemporary artists like Damien Hirst, as well 
        as Gilbert and George, is clear evidence in support of this view. For

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Art is created when an artist creates

      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is simply a &quot;working&quot; definition: 
        broad enough to encompass most forms of contemporary art, but narrow enough 
        to exclude &quot;events&quot; whose &quot;artistic&quot; content falls 
        below accepted levels. In addition, please note that the word &quot;artist&quot; 
        is included to allow for the context of the work; the word &quot;beautiful&quot; 
        is included to reflect the need for some &quot;aesthetic&quot; value; 
        while the phrase &quot;that is considered by his audience to have artistic

        Its Positive Impact, Do We Need to Define Art?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For centuries, if not millennia, people 
        have been emotionally affected - sometimes overwhelmed - by works of art:

        painters</a> of the modern era, like Van Gogh, Picasso and Auguste Rodin. 
        Poetry, ballet and films can be equally uplifting. So while we may not 
        be able to explain precisely what art is, we cannot deny the impact it 
        has on our lives - one reason why <a href="public-art.htm">public art</a>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="help"></a>Q. How Does a Definition

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The very essence of creativity means it 
        cannot be defined and pigeon-holed. Any attempt at doing so, will quickly 
        become out-of-date and thus pointless, even counter-productive. What happens, 
        for instance, if an artist produces something that by popular consensus 
        is &quot;art&quot;, but isn't accepted as such by the arts establishment? 
        It's worth remembering that we still can't define a &quot;table&quot; 
        or an &quot;elephant&quot;, but it doesn't cause us much difficulty!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="values"></a>Q. Is Art Simply 
        a Reflection of Our Personal Values?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's fair to say that someone educated 
        in the values of Renaissance art, and who therefore has a reasonable understanding 
        of traditional painting, is less likely to regard postmodernist installations 
        as art, than a person without such an understanding. Similarly, a person 
        who loves TV and thinks museums are generally rather boring and unexciting 
        places, is more likely to be impressed with contemporary video art than 
        someone else who is comfortable with traditional museum exhibitions. Because 
        of this, one might say that a person's attitude to art says more about 
        his or her personal values, than the art itself.</font></p>

        or psychologists? After all, the world is full of so-called &quot;experts&quot; 
        - structuralists, proceduralists, functionalists, as well as the usual 
        crop of political theorists like Marxists and so on - who can't agree

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="4"><b><a name="crafts"></a>The 'Arts Versus 
        Crafts' Debate</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">According to the traditional theory of 
        art, there is a basic difference between an 'art' and a 'craft'. Put simply, 
        although both activities involve creative skills, the former involves 
        a higher degree of intellectual involvement. Under this analysis, a basket-weaver 
        (say) would be considered a craftsperson, while a bag-designer would be 
        considered an artist. In this rather artificial distinction between arts 
        and <a href="crafts-history-types.htm">crafts</a>, functionality is a 
        key factor. Thus, a jeweller who designs and makes non-functional items 
        like rings or necklaces would be considered an artist, while a watchmaker 
        would be a craftsperson; someone who makes glass might be a craftsman, 
        but a person who makes stained glass is an artist. The idea is that artists 
        are somehow superior because they 'create' things of beauty, while craftsmen 
        perform repetitive or purely functional actions. There may be some truth 
        behind this theory, but many types of craftsmanship seem no different 
        to genuine art. An example perhaps, is a cartoonist-animator, exployed 
        to draw thousands of similar pictures of a cartoon character like 'Charlie 
        Brown'. True, his 'art' is purely functional and highly commercial, but 
        no one could deny he was an artist. Note: see also: <a href="history-of-art/arts-and-crafts.htm">Arts 
        and Crafts Movement</a> (1862-1914).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="renaissance"></a>The Impact 
        of the Renaissance on the Western Concept of Art</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In general, until the early Renaissance 
        of the 15th century, all artists were considered tradesmen/craftsmen. 
        Even the greatest painters like Giotto, Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci 
        and Raphael were seen as no more than skilled workers, while master sculptors 
        like Donatello were seen as mere specialist stone-cutters and bronze metalworkers. 
        Indeed, it was Leonardo's and Michelangelo's stated aim to raise the level 
        of the artist to that of a profession - an ambition which was duly realized 
        in 1561 with the founding of the first Art Academy in Florence, which 
        was set up to train people in the profession of drawing (<a href="drawing/disegno.htm">disegno</a>).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, although Renaissance artists succeeded 
        in raising their craft to the level of a profession, they defined art 
        as an essentially intellectual activity. This fixed Renaissance idea of 
        art being primarily an intellectual discipline was passed on down the 
        centuries and still influences present day conceptions of the meaning 
        of art. Despite some modifications, as exemplified by changes in art school 
        curricula, fine art still maintains its notional superiority over crafts 
        such as applied and decorative arts.</font></p>

        can explore it further by asking questions about its nature and scope. 
        Here are some of the key questions along with a short commentary. (See 
        also: <a href="colour-art-glossary.htm">Colour Art Glossary</a>)</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="point"></a>What's the Point 
        of Art?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sceptics say that art is a waste of time. 
        Even the famous poet WH Auden confessed that no poem saved a single person 
        from the Nazi gas-chambers. And while this may sound a rather meaningless 
        statement, it highlights the notion that art has a limited use in our 
        daily life, except in the case of attractive-looking buildings, teapots, 
        cars or clothes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are two broad answers: first, applied 
        art is a major branch of art which cannot easily be separated from fine 
        art, because the root of all design (which is the foundation of applied 
        art) is fine art. Second, ever since <i>Homo Sapiens</i> developed the 
        facility of contemplation, he has expressed his thoughts in pictorial 
        form. At the same time, he has continued to appreciate beauty - whether 
        in the form of human faces or bodies, sunsets, animal-skin colours, cathedrals 
        or sculpture. In a nutshell, to create and to appreciate art is to be 
        human. That's the point.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="bad"></a>How to Distinguish 
        Good Art from Bad Art?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not being able to define art doesn't mean 
        that all artworks are good. Trouble is, who decides where good art ends 
        and bad begins?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This popular question may stem from our 
        natural desire to avoid being hoodwinked by snake-oil salesmen dressed 
        up as 'artists', but whatever its origin it is not a particularly important 
        issue. In practice, professional artists need public acceptance. So while 
        temporary art-fashions may occasionally promote works of apparently dubious 
        value, the general public (as well as the artistic community) is unlikely 
        to stand by and allow bad art to become commonplace.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="experts"></a>Why Do Art Experts 
        Make Everything Sound So Complicated?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An example of this might be the jargon-infested 
        articles commonly encountered in arts magazines, where nobody seems to 
        use plain language anymore. Other culprits include exhibition catalogues 
        and art books.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The writers of this stuff might say that 
        such jargon is no more than necessary shorthand, and that it is mostly 
        written for other 'experts'. But is this really true? For example, it 
        is almost impossible to find a book with a simple explanation of Cubism. 
        So how does a young student get to understand why Picasso and Braque's 
        revolutionery movement is so important? The same could be said about dozens 
        of things in the world of art. And some abstract art sounds so complicated 
        that we almost need a PhD in order to properly 'comprehend' it. (See next 
        question for examples)</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="abstract"></a>What's the Meaning 
        of Abstract Art? It Looks Weird!</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Up until the late nineteenth century, most 
        painting and sculpture adhered to traditional principles. Typically, it 
        was <a href="representational-art.htm">representational</a> and naturalistic. 
        Then Impressionism changed everything by introducing non-natural colour 
        schemes: a process continued by the Fauves and the Expressionists. Then 
        Cubism rejected the notion of depth or perspective in painting, and opened 
        the door to more <a href="abstract-art.htm">abstract art</a>, including 
        movements like Futurism, De Stijl, Dada, Constructivism, Surrealism, Neo-Plasticism, 
        Abstract Expressionism, and Op-Art, to name but a few. In Ireland, painters 
        like Mary Swanzy, Mainie Jellet and Evie Hone were early pioneers of such 
        modern art.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because abstract art has few if any naturalistic 
        elements, it is not as instantly appreciable as (say) a classical portrait 
        or landscape. And if you prefer a work of art to portray recognizable 
        people and surroundings, then abstract art is not likely to be for you. 
        But, let's be honest, is this so different from recoiling at the idea 
        of wearing a particular colour or style of clothing? Different people 
        like different things, and this applies to art as much as to jobs, cars, 
        houses, furniture, vacations, and everything else you can think of.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Abstract, or non-naturalistic paintings 
        tend to contain an implicit message or follow a particular theory of art. 
        This can make them less likeable and less beautiful to some people, but 
        it doesn't mean they can't be outstanding works of art.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><a name="subsidy"></a>Should Art be 
        Subsidized?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is extremely hard for most full-time 
        artists to earn a living from (say) their painting or sculpture. To this, 
        the sceptics retort: &quot;well if no one wants to buy their stuff, why 
        should the tax-payer pay for it?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One should not dismiss this concern too 
        lightly. After all, these sceptics aren't saying that artists shouldn't 
        practise their art, simply that an artist should seek private sponsorship.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One answer to the question is this. First, 
        in reality, most art colleges train students in a range of highly commercial 
        activities, notably in the area of applied art and design. So for these 
        individuals there is no question of subsidy. Moreover, those students 
        who do opt for a full-time career as a painter or sculptor, are choosing 
        a very arduous and materially unrewarding type of life. Not least because 
        sponsorship (in the form of public commissions, bursaries, artist-in-residences, 
        and other grants) is actually very meagre. The level of public subsidy 
        of the arts in Western countries remains pretty low, compared to other 
        equivalent areas. So even here, the amount of public money being spent 
        on works of art is not especially significant.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nonetheless, public money is being spent, 
        and here is a reason for it. Beauty, whether in the form of an attractive-looking 
        car, a well-designed public building or square, a colourful dress, or 
        an inspiring sculpture, is one of the few phenomena that lifts the spirits 
        and reminds us there is more to life than the price of eggs. But without 
        art, this range of aesthetic experiences will gradually dwindle, as beauty 
        becomes progressively downgraded as a worthwhile goal. Literature (if 
        not history) is full of examples of this type of society, where functionality 
        is everything and citizens wear the same drab clothing, dwell in the same 
        drab apartments, and lead the same drab lives.</font></p>
