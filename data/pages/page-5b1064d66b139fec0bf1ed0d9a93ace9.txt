<P>                 
        Literature is written art--art in which a writing device is used to put words 
on paper.  Here are some basic kinds of literature: 
</P>
<P align="center"><b>fiction<br>
stage play<br>
poetry/song<br>
literary essay<br>
creative nonfiction<br>
screenplay<br>
comic strip script<br>
video script<br>
comic book script</b>
</P>
<P>        Though all forms of literature are written, some of them are meant for 
performance as are plays and video scripts, and some are mixed with visual forms to 
become comic books, cards, or posters.  
     </P>
<P>        Some forms of writing are, primarily, a stage art or visual art.  Stage plays 
are the obvious example.  However, such works also are very highly respected as 
written literature, too:  art that can be both visual and literary. 
     </P>
<P>        In addition, some literature is meant to be read out loud.  Poetry and plays 
are examples.  Poetry and plays often come fully alive only when read out loud, even 
if this means people must read them out loud when alone.  In short, to fully 
appreciate poetry and plays, people should perform them.  Plays and other performance 
arts are discussed in a later chapter.  Poetry is discussed in this chapter along with 
other nonperformance literature such as stories and creative nonfiction because most 
of these forms of literature primarily are experienced by reading them when one is 
alone.

</P>
<P>        &quot;Literature&quot; actually may be defined as any piece of writing
that can claim 
that it has--in some way--artistic beauty.  
     </P>
<P>        A grocery list (unless, possibly, done as part of a longer literary 
work) is not literature.
<i>War and Peace</i> by Tolstoy is.  So are <i>Peter Rabbit</i> by Beatrix Potter, 
significant parts of great religious 
works of art such as the Bible or the Hindu Bhagavid Gita, Shakespeare's plays and 
poetry, and finely crafted nonfiction such as Plato's <i>Republic</i> or Martin Luther King's 
&quot;I Have A Dream&quot; speech. 
</P>
<P>        Sometimes it is not so much the subject matter that makes a piece of writing 
literature, as it is the way in which the subject matter is handled.  The grocery list
mentioned above could appear in a beautifully crafted humorous article or fiction 
story, in a finely tuned poem, or even in a speech, thus giving even its simple 
grocery-list contents a special beauty or meaning.  Sometimes the subject matter does 
make a difference, though:  important subjects sometimes lead people to talk and write 
more eloquently.  
     </P>
<P>        When people write or speak of such subjects as visions of the soul, the 
eternal conflict between good and evil, great romance, or the tragedy of loving or of 
warring, the subject matter itself may incline them to create written works of art
that can move everyone else deeply, even change people's lives. 
</P>
<P>        A very brief history of literature highlights the following events.  Before 
500 B.C., there was almost no written literature.  A few pieces of literature did 
exist on clay tablets or carved in stone--clay and stone were the first mediums of the 
writing arts.  But most literature was still oral in those days:  literature was part 
of an oral tradition.  In fact, storytelling was a profession in more civilized 
ancient countries, and storytellers would make their living by memorizing great 
classics of myth, legend, and truth from each other, then repeating them to enraptured 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>        Papyrus, rough paper-like material made from reeds, came into more common use 
after the fifth century B.C. in Europe and Africa, and similar materials came into use 
about the same time in the Far East.  The mediums of papyrus and paints and inks made 
writing easier. 
     </P>
<P>        Some of the earliest classics of written literature began to appear from that 
period of history, works such as the Old Testament of the Hebrew Bible, the works of 
early Greek philosophers and playwrights, the Tao Te Ching of Lao-tzu, and other great 
works of art.&nbsp;        From this rough papyrus or &quot;paper,&quot; more refined and mass produced versions 
were developed as the centuries progressed to medieval times.&nbsp; Early 
through late medieval times saw monastaries (in the Western world), universities 
(in the Islamic cultures of North Africa and the Middle East), and the courts of 
kings and princes (in the Far East) collecting older writings from wherever they 
could, collecting them in small libraries, and copying them by hand to share 
with others.&nbsp; In 1408, for example, the <i>Yongle Dadian</i>--a copy of all 
existing writings in China, was made by order of Chinese Emperor Yongle.&nbsp; 
It is through the sometimes heroic but more often tedious work by a limited 
number of intelligent copiers that many early written works have been preserved, 
even while many others were forever lost.</P>
<P>        However, even with copying by hand, reading and writing literature still were activities few engaged in.  
Many works of art from oral traditions were written down such as myths, popular events 
and plays, common songs, speeches commissioned to be written by kings, and the like.   
But in any given century, the choices of &quot;new works&quot; to read were few. 
</P>
<P>        Many people associate the word &quot;literature&quot; with novels and fictional short 
stories.  Curiously enough, telling made-up stories in written story form is a rather 
recent art.  The novel and the short story, as such, did not really exist until after 
moveable type was invented in medieval times by Gutenberg, and after the slow spread 
of general education in reading and writing that followed the invention of moveable 
type.  
</P>
<P>        However, with the spread of reading and writing, suddenly large numbers of 
people had the ability and opportunity to sit down with a book of their own and 
actually understand what the words in it were saying.  Literature exploded, both in 
quantity and variety.  
</P>
<P>        Now there are have thousands of great works of literature to choose from, and 
hundreds of thousands of quality minor works of literature available to readers, with
more being produced every day.  In addition, literature in the present time is going 
visual:  the predominant way of getting a finely crafted story is now, for most 
Americans, the television screen.  Just as books used to be for the privileged few, so 
was viewing plays.  Now not only have books become common personal items, but so has 
the viewing of plays.  The TV screen brings into each person's own hands the means to 
see any great literary work in visual form which he or she may wish to. 
     
</P>
<P><u><b><font size="4"><a name="What Is A Story">What Is A &quot;Story&quot;?</a></font></b></u>
</P>
<P>        Most forms of literature tell, in some way or another, stories.  Stories can 
be true or made up, stories are in songs and in plays, they may be found in simple 
poems and in complex speeches, and they exist in novels and short fiction. 
     </P>
<P>        There are stories like Ulysses and the Sirens who sang so beautifully they 
tempted men to crash upon the rocks in seeking them, stories that make people sit on 
the edges of their seats.  There are stories like those of Aristophanes or Woody Allen
that keeps audiences laughing throughout them.  There are stories like Shakespeare's
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> that make people cry, even stories like those of Moses, Krishna, or 
Confucius that shape the ways hundreds of millions of people throughout the world 
live and believe. 
</P>
<P>        Perhaps the easiest way to understand how both content and style form a 
beautiful, moving story is to look at the basic plan or structure of storytelling. 
</P>
<P>        That structure often may be summarized as follows:  
     </P>
<P align="center">                <b><font size="4">plot--events with a purpose</font></b> 
</P>
<P align="center">                <b><font size="4">character--people talking
and acting</font></b> 
</P>
<P align="center">                <b><font size="4">description--surroundings
and symbols</font></b> 
</P>
<P>     &quot;Plot&quot; is the basic plan of a story.  It is the person, problem, and solution--
the hero/heroine, obstacles, and outcome.  It is the &quot;Once upon a time X had a problem 
with Y&quot; sentence often found in some form or way in the first page of a story.  It is 
also the series of events that the good characters go through--or take upon 
themselves--to try to get to a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>     &quot;Character&quot; is the characterization or development of the people in a story.  
Character means that the reader gets to see characters talking, thinking, feeling, and 
acting.  They experience difficult times and pleasant times.  Their talking and acting 
demonstrates their hopes, dreams, inner and outer selves, needs, and pasts. 

</P>
<P>     &quot;Description&quot; means well described settings, sensory details about the characters 
and their actions, and, often, good simile, metaphor, and other use of symbols to help 
us see what people and things in the story symbolize or stand for. 
</P>
<P>        Let's look at each of these three elements of stories in turn. 

</P>
<P><u><b><font size="4">Plot--The Plan of the Story&nbsp;</font></b></u>
</P>
<P>
        &quot;Plot&quot; is the basic structure, skeleton, or direction of a story.   It is who 
did what to whom, when, and why.  The difference between just an event and a plot is 
that an event is, simply, a description of something that has happened.  But a plot is 
a description of how a person goes through change. 
</P>
<P>        This change, this pattern, has been described in a number of ways.  Here are 
some: 
</P>
<div align="center">
  <center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="75%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" align="center"><u><b>person</b></u>
      <p>hero/heroine(s)<br>
      good person(s)<br>
      main character</td>

      resolution<br>
      end</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  </center>
</div>
<P align="left">Someone or some group of people that are basically good or 
trustworthy have to be at the center of the story, they must have problems of some kind, and 
they must try to reach a goal or end to their 
problems, or create a successful change. They don't always win--some of the best 
tragedies show people losing--but they must try with all their heart.<br>
<br>
It may help to imagine the plot of a story as a character battling to climb over 
a mountain of trouble in his or her way:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Plot%20Diagram2.gif" width="445" height="223">&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>        The &quot;rising action&quot; is the events leading to reaching the goal (or 
forever failing to reach the goal).&nbsp; The &quot;falling action&quot; is the end of the 
story--what happens after the denouement, as a result of it.&nbsp; Stories 
usually are composed mostly--perhaps 90-99%--of rising action.&nbsp; The falling 
action or denouement is simply there to provide what Aristotle in his famous 
booklet &quot;Poetics&quot;--a description of how tragedy and comedy are 
written--describes as relief and happiness (or tears of grief), which is the 
audience's final release of emotion at the end.&nbsp; Some modern stories even 
do entirely without a denouement: they simply end right at the moment the goal 
is achieved.</P>
<P>        This is how a plot is organized.  But it must also have well developed 
characters and good descriptions to make it enjoyable and meaningful to read. 

</P>
<P><u><b><font size="4">Character--Unusual People or Unusual Lives</font></b></u> 
</P>
<P>        &quot;Character&quot; means the development of people in a story who are: 
</P>
<P align="center">                                   <b>1. identifiable</b> 
</P>
<P align="center"><b>2. interesting</b> 
</P>
<P>        &quot;Identifiable&quot; means that a reader can either identify with the characters 
because they seem like him or her, or the reader has experienced other people like 
them.  In short, the characters must be believable in an immediate and personal way.  
     </P>
<P>        Romeo and Juliet from Shakespeare are, for example, very identifiable, very 
believable:  at some age or time in one's life, many people can identify with one of 
the two lovers, and most people have watched others who act like Romeo and Juliet.  
     </P>
<P>        Usually a story people enjoy will have at least one main character--a hero or 
heroine--whom the readers can directly identify with:  someone who makes others say, 
&quot;That person is like me,&quot; or &quot;I can imagine myself being in that person's shoes.&quot;   
</P>
<P>        &quot;Interesting&quot; means that the characters must not only be identifiable--
believable--but also more interesting than the normal run of people in life.  Either 
the characters must be unusual people, or they must be normal people living unusual 
lives.&nbsp; They must also be attractive in a certain way.&nbsp; Their 
attractiveness must be &quot;normal&quot; in important ways, but usually there is a slight 
flaw--physically, psychologically, or both--that makes the character a little 
different in an even more interesting way.</P>
<P>        Some famous unusual characters in literary history are the great figures of any 
major religion (remember that true stories can be written as good literature, too); 
mythic figures such as Thor, Venus, and Coyote; and book heroes, heroines, and 
villains such as Tom Jones, Heidi, Darth Vadar, Nancy Drew, and Harry Potter.&nbsp; 
However, even when unusual people are heroes, heroines, or villains in literature, 
much of their appeal  is how much they are, in some basic ways, like ourselves or 
people we know.&nbsp; This appeal to readers' own personalities or the 
personalities of people near them usually is the central attraction of a good 
character.</P>
<P>        The same attraction exists for the other kind of literary character:  a normal person living an unusual life.        There are many examples 
of such characters--in fact, much of the best literature may be about 
characters with whom most readers can closely identify.  Tiny Tim and his family in <i>A
Christmas Carol</i> are one example; so is Anne Frank or Agatha Christie's 
bumbling but loveable and intelligent detective, Poirot.  These all are characters with whom large numbers of readers can identify 
because the characters are so much like average readers that readers can put 
themselves in the characters' shoes and ask themselves, &quot;How would I respond to what 
this character must go through?&quot; 
</P>
<P>        In fact, it is said that there is at least one good book lying within 
each person--if he or she only knew how to write it.  If this is true, it is because all of 
us experience the deep joys and beauties of life, and  great sorrows and losses, 
too.  It is readers' own experiences that help them 
identify with normal characters in literature who are going through unusually good 
and/or bad times.&nbsp; We imagine ourselves in their shoes, and we imagine 
ourselves acting like they would in trying, difficult times.</P>
<P>        Authors of good literature are very concerned to develop good characters.  
Sometimes their characters just leap  from their brains, nearly completely formed.  
At other times, characters must be developed step by step to make them three-
dimensional--to make them have the fullness and believability of human life.  
Believable characters usually have some of the following traits developed on the pages 
of their stories: 
</P>
<P align="center">                <b>how they look<br>
how they sound<br>
what they wear<br>
their emotions, desires, beliefs<br>
where their work<br>
their hobbies<br>
their dark secrets<br>
their past<br>
future hopes, goals, and plans<br>
their family, friends, and relationships</b>           
</P>
<P>        Even if such traits are sometimes only briefly hinted at, it is the variety 
and depth of these that help make a character three-dimensional.  When combined with 
a plot that makes them strive with their soul to change and be better, three-
dimensional characters easily will move readers to tears of joy, laugher, and sorrow--
if they also are well described. 

</P>
<P><u><b><font size="4">Description--Sensory Details and Symbols&nbsp;</font></b></u>
</P>
<P>        &quot;Description&quot; is the words used to describe the characters and settings--what 
people and things look like, sound like, and feel like. There are a number of techniques authors use to develop good descriptions.  
Some of the most important are as follows: 
</P>
<P align="center">                        <b>the 5 W's of journalism</b> 
</P>
<P align="center">                        <b>the 5 senses</b> 
</P>
<P align="center">                        <b>active verbs</b> 
</P>
<P align="center">                        <b>use of symbols</b> 
</P>
<P>
        The &quot;five W's&quot; of journalism are 
     </P>
<P align="center"><b>WHO<br>
WHAT<br>
WHERE<br>
WHEN<br>
WHY (or HOW)</b> 
</P>
<P>The traditional news article--and many good stories--tell readers in the first several 
sentences who and what the story is about, where and when it is happening, and why or 
how it is happening.  These are natural questions to ask, and good stories usually 
describe--or at least hint at--what the story is about in the very beginning.  
     </P>
<P>        The beginning of a story makes a promise of sorts, displaying the type of 
people, the setting, and the style or mood that can be expected for the rest of the 
story.  Readers continue to read the story only on the basis that the author will, in 
effect, keep this promise.  The 5 W's of journalism are one common way of supplying 
this promise. 
     </P>
<P>        The &quot;five senses&quot; are 
</P>
<P align="center"><b>SIGHT<br>
SOUND<br>
TOUCH<br>
SMELL<br>
TASTE</b> 
</P>
<P>One of the most important differences between a good story and  a bad one are the 
details.  Good details may be many things, but in stories, often, they are sensory 
details.  The use of the five senses helps a story frequently tell about just one 
person or group of people in one place at one time.  In addition, a story feels much 
more three-dimensional, more sensually whole to readers, when all five senses and not 
just one or two have been used. 
</P>
<P>        &quot;Active verbs&quot; mean simply that authors often try to make movies, not just 
paint pictures, when they are creating scenes. In other words, authors use active verbs to show people and places in action--
moving, breathing, and living --rather than frozen in time.  
     </P>
<P>        Not all authors use this technique, but certainly most of the ones who are 
successful at creating best-selling literature do this.  Active verbs means that 
instead of describing a dove, for example, sitting on oak tree, it often is better to 
show the dove flying down to the oak tree as the tree branch waves in the wind.  This 
method creates a spare but intense style of descriptive writing as often is seen in 
good journalistic news writing or, for example, in the Chinese-style writing of some 
of Pearl Buck's novels. 
</P>
<P>        &quot;Use of symbols&quot; is another important part of descriptive
writing. Symbols are individual things, acts, or people that stand for other ideas, 
events, or people.  For example, in the literature of many cultures, fire stands for 
anger or cleansing; or, for example, a parade or circus stands for how it feels to 
live life.  Sometimes symbols are used just briefly in passing, as in a sentence like 
&quot;She ran as fast as the wind.&quot;  At other times, a whole story symbolizes something 
great or important, such as romantic love and sacrifice in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.  
     </P>
<P>        The simplest formula authors often use for symbolism is the &quot;like
a&quot; formula:  
something is &quot;like&quot; something else.  The most complex or richest form of symbol occurs 
when a whole story rises to special heights of meaning because it speaks to thousands&nbsp;
or even millions of people about something basic in the human condition.  This is, in 
fact true of all great art--it is symbolic of readers' own lives, and so it rises to a 
special level where it describes readers' own existences. 
     </P>
<P>        These four elements of description--the 5 W's, the 5 senses, active verbs, and 
symbol--are just some of the techniques authors use to deliver vivid words and worlds 
so that readers feel they  are present in the lives, minute by minute, of the 
characters. 

</P>
<P><u><b><font size="4">Creative Nonfiction</font></b></u> 
     </P>
<P>        Many pieces of creative writing are excellent literature but do not tell a 
story.  Stirring speeches such as Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have A Dream&quot; speech, or 
philosophical or religious writings such as Lao-tsu's <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, are rich pieces of 
literature that do not tell a story.  
</P>
<P>        However, they use other elements of good storytelling, often especially the 
descriptive devices of active verbs and symbolism (see the section on &quot;Description&quot; 
earlier in this chapter) and any or all of the poetic devices (see the section on 
&quot;Poetry&quot; later in this chapter.) 
     </P>
<P>        However, there is one element that non-story literature emphasizes more than 
other forms of literature, and that is its organizational structure.  A
non-story piece 
of literature usually is some kind of essay:  either argumentative (trying to make a 
point) or explanatory (simply sharing facts). 
</P>
<P>        Either way, such a writing has a central post or pillar, a central theme, to 
it--something that can be summed up in just a sentence or two and is the very core of 
what the author is trying to express. 
</P>
<P>        One method of imagining this central organizing theme is to think of it as the 
hub or axle of a wheel, and to think of the descriptive or poetic devices as the 
spokes that help keep the outer wheel of the writing spinning. Another method is to think of a central theme as a real post or pillar--or 
even, perhaps, a stick person whose clothing is the drapery of descriptive and poetic 
devices in which the essay is dressed.














</P>
<P>        Another method of describing this pattern of organization in most literary 
essays is as follows: 
</P>

</div>
<P>This form of organization often is found, partly or completely, in many stories and 
poems as well. 

</P>
<P><u><b><font size="4">Poetry--Where Each Word Counts</font></b></u> 
</P>
<P>        Poetry is the music of the literary world.  Most of its functions are 
performed to some extent by the other literary arts; but rarely are they performed so 
purely as in the seemingly simple but rich form of poetry.  Some of the elements of 
poetry are as follows: 
</P>
<P align="center"><b>rhythm<br>
rhyme<br>
brevity<br>
tightness<br>
poignancy</b> 
</P>
<P>        The &quot;rhythm&quot; and &quot;rhyme&quot; of a traditional poem are obvious.  Rhythm means that 
it has a regular beat to it, as does a song, and rhyme means that the words at the 
ends of some or all lines end in similar sounds.  Here is an example broken into 
rhythm and rhyme patterns (rhythms are represented by capital versus small
letters; rhymes are represented by underlining): 
                             </P>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="75%">
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" align="center">We wore the hat<br>
        That held the cat.</td>
      <td width="50%" align="center">               we WORE the <u> HAT</u><br>
              that HELD the <u>CAT</u></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<P>In a modern poem, rhythms and rhymes are not obvious.  They are still there, however.  
The author uses rhythm by creating the natural rhythms of speech while still 
emphasizing important words.  And the author uses rhyme by having sounds within words 
and within lines rhyme with each other: 
</P>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="75%">

        <u>i</u>n <u>T</u>EAR<u>S</u> from my BROW.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<P>
        &quot;Brevity&quot; and &quot;tightness&quot; both mean that a poem must be concise.  It usually 
is brief, expressing a single feeling or idea in one printed page or less (though much 
longer poems sometimes are possible).  And poems also are supposed to be tight--to be 
edited carefully and tightly.  This means that every word must be absolutely 
necessary, and no extra words should be used to express the idea or feeling.  This 
requires careful editing and rewriting. 
</P>
<P>        Finally, &quot;image&quot; and &quot;poignancy&quot; mean that a poem should be sensory and 
emotional.  &quot;Image&quot; means that a poem should be a series of sensory images and 
symbols, rather than a series of abstract ideas or summaries of feelings.  Often a 
poem will try to develop no more than one image per line. 
</P>
<P>        &quot;Poignancy&quot; means that these images should develop in the reader a strong and 
often special--even delicate--emotion that fills up a reader's imagination.  Notice 
the difference in image and in feeling between the following two versions of a poem: 
</P>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="75%">
    <tr>
      <td width="50%" align="center">We had a great time<br>

        but it felt very good<br>
        to come home, too.</td>
      <td width="50%" align="center">The ship rode starlit waves<br>

    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<P>        These six elements--rhythm and rhyme, brevity and tightness, and image and 
poignancy--are basic to many forms of literature; but they are found especially in 
poems. 

</P>
<P><u><b><font size="4">Divisions of Literary Criticism&nbsp;</font></b></u>
</P>
<P>        Professional literary critics often are loosely associated with a certain 
&quot;school&quot; of criticism.  A &quot;school&quot; of criticism is a loosely connected group of 
critics who approach the criticism of literature with certain basic beliefs in common.  
Multicultural criticism, for example, begins with the belief that most literary works
that claim to be great literature must have a multicultural focus.  If they do not, 
then they are the opposite:  they are an expression of one culture's dominance and 
perhaps even prejudice against other cultures.  A multicultural critic might observe, 
for example, the works of John Steinbeck, author of such books as <i>The Grapes of
Wrath</i>, <i>The Pearl</i>, and <i>The Winter of our Discontent</i>.  Such a critic might argue that whereas 
Steinbeck does seem to discuss only white, middle-class American culture in some 
individual books (e.g. <i>The Winter of our Discontent</i>), still in a majority of his other 
books Steinbeck deals with several cultures, economic levels, and even races, either 
individually or as they mix with each other.  Therefore, a multicultural critic might 
conclude, Steinbeck meets the test of being a multicultural writer. 
</P>
<P>        However, another type of literary critic might negatively criticize 
Steinbeck's literary works.  The feminist school of criticism, for example, believes 
that any literature that defines itself as great literature must show women as strong 
human beings in their own right who are capable of growth, independence, and living a 
complex, rich, and rewarding life.  Any literary work that does not express these 
values directly or indirectly cannot claim to be great literature, for it echoes 
instead the negative values of sexism, male authoritarianism, and male violence. 
</P>
<P>        From a feminist critical standpoint, Steinbeck's novels can be criticized at&nbsp;
least to the extent that they rarely show female characters who are well developed, 
rich, and complex.  Steinbeck does not seem to consciously degrade women in general in 
his novels.  However, most of his characters are men, the worlds he creates for them 
are places where power, authoritarianism, and violence exist, and therefore his novels 
may be called &quot;masculine&quot; novels at the least and, possibly, antifeminist novels as 
well. 
</P>
<P>     There are many other schools of literary criticism as well.  If you were to place 
two critics from each of five different literary schools in the same room, you might 
find that all ten often would disagree with each other in interpreting the meaning and 
value of any single literary work.  However, the very multiplicity of critical 
viewpoints adds to the richness of the discipline called literary criticism, and 
allows for constant reevaluation of the most basic and important values the world 
attaches to its storytellers and their literature. 
</P>
<P>
        Here are some schools of literary criticism: 
</P>
<P>        <b>HISTORICAL AND BIOGRAPHICAL CRITICISM</b>:  Much literary
        criticism for several hundred years was composed of historical, biographical, 
        moral, religious, and philosophical criticism.  The first of these two, 
        historical and biographical criticism, still is a common approach in 
        elementary and secondary literature classes:  one examines the historical 
        events surrounding or related to a literary work, or the biographical details 
        of an author's life as they impinge upon the literary work that he or she has 
        written.  As a basis for developing a viewpoint about a literary work, such 
        criticism is a good start.  However, many academic literary critics wish for 
        much more. 
</P>
<P>        <b>MORAL, RELIGIOUS, AND PHILOSOPHICAL CRITICISM</b>:  Those in the
academy who used go beyond historical and biographical criticism found few 
        tools with which to do so.  The primary intellectual tools available to them 
        were to use moral and ethical theories, the beliefs of religion, and the 
        beliefs of philosophy to explain and discuss literature.  
</P>
<P>        <b>FORM CRITICISM</b>:  In the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth 
        centuries, newer forms of criticism arose.  One of these was form criticism, 
        and it developed as a reaction against earlier, traditional forms of criticism
that didn't seem to have much to do with explaining the quality of 
        storytelling or the other artistic elements of literature.  Form critics argue 
        that one should judge a work of literature solely on the basis of its artistic 
        merits.  Form critics discuss only the elements of a literary work and how 
        they are used well or poorly, and usually avoid discussing anything to do with 
        the author's background, the historical times in that the work of literature 
        was written, or any theories of psychology, sociology, politics, et al. and 
        how they affect or are used in the literary work.  None of these, say form 
        critics, are relevant to examining the elements of the work itself.  This type 
        of criticism arose as a reaction against oversimplification, especially in 
        historical and geographical criticism.  
</P>
<P>        <b>PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISM</b>:  Psychological criticism arose in
        the nineteenth and early twentieth century as an alternative to traditional 
        forms of criticism.  It is based on the insights of psychology.  Psychological&nbsp;
critics take the position that literary works demonstrate principals of 
        psychology and therefore can be analyzed to show how well or poorly basic 
        tenets of psychology are expressed.  In its most limited sense, this school of 
        criticism is connected primarily with the theories of Sigmund Freud, the 
        primary founder of modern psychology.  However, in its widest sense, 
        psychological criticism contains other schools of thought as well:  Jungian 
        archetypal criticism and mythological criticism (both of that look for the 
        basic commonalities of the human race's symbols in literature, symbols such as 
        rituals of birth, marriage, and death, and the mythic gods and goddesses of 
        the world); anthropological criticism (looking in literature for themes 
        typical of cultures throughout the world and time such as the sacrificial 
        hero, the earth mother, etc.); and other psychological theories--Adlerian, 
        transactional, etc. 
</P>
<P>        <b>POLITICAL &amp; SOCIAL CRITICISM</b>:  Political and social criticism became
popular in the twentieth century and is related to--and an improvement upon--
        the more traditional forms of moral and philosophical criticism.  Like these 
        earlier criticisms, political and social criticism looks at the broader 
        beliefs and systems such as democracy, authoritarianism, and communalism
that link people together into workable systems of government and action.  
        Political and social critics look for examples of various forms of political 
        and social systems in literature.  The Marxist school of criticism is one of 
        the better known sub-groupings of these types of criticism. 
</P>
<P>        <b>FEMINIST CRITICISM</b>:  Feminist criticism is an offshoot in some ways
        of both psychological criticism and political and social criticisms:  as women 
        became more empowered in literary and academic circles in the latter part of 
        the twentieth century, there was an increasing call for a gender-related form 
        of criticism that not only negated the sexism, authoritarianism, and violence 
        of much of male-oriented and male-written literature, but also described 
        positive feminist values that exist in the literature of many women and some 
        men writers.   Some examples of subgroupings of this school are Marxist 
        feminism, minority feminist studies (i.e., black feminist studies, Chicano 
        feminist studies, etc.), lesbian studies, and psychoanalytic feminism. 
</P>
<P>        <b>MULTICULTURAL CRITICISM</b>:  Multicultural critics judge a literary work
        on how well or poorly it exemplifies the people and their values in other 
        cultures.  Some branches of multicultural criticism include Afro-American 
        literary studies, Latin American studies, and many other racial and cultural 
        categories.  It also sometimes is understood to include gender and feminist 
        studies.  Multicultural criticism in all its varieties is among the newest 
        schools of criticism. 
</P>
<P><b>OTHER CRITICISM</b>:  Other forms of criticism exist, too.  Traditional 
        Aristotelian criticism looks at the formal categories of literature described 
        thousands of years ago by Aristotle, linguistic criticisms examine the uses of 
        language in literature, genre and rhetorical criticism look at the structural 
        parts or building blocks of literary works, reader-response criticism examines 
        readers' responses to literature, and many discipline-specific
sub-schools (new 
        historical criticism, genetic criticism, existential-philosophical criticism, 
        etc.) develop their own particular literary criticism using the intellectual 
        tools of their discipline. 
</P>
<P><u><b><font size="4">The Purpose of Literature</font></b></u> 
                                </P>
<P>        What is the purpose of literature? 
        </P>
<P>        First, it has a very important function within the context of society and 
history.  Literature quite simply is a world changer.  The present world civilizations 
are based on communication.  Histories, languages, cultures and arts--everything 
involved in the humanities depends on and flowers through communication.  Literature 
sets the example both in content and in style for the finest communication that can 
come through voice, paper, or visual play. Study the literature of a race or people, 
and you  have studied the marks they have tracked through time. It is impossible to 
know most races or people in history without reference to their literature.  Their 
literature, oral or written, <b>is</b> them, and they are their literature. 
</P>
<P>        Another purpose of literature is entertainment.  This is easily forgotten in 
the rush to consider the intellectual, ethical, and social importance of various 
literary works.  However, part of the definition of &quot;great literature&quot; is that it has 
been able for many years to entertain people very well indeed.  Such entertainment 
might cause horror and sadness as well as--or instead of--laughter and excitement.  
Whatever the emotion, great literature gives pleasure. 
</P>
<P>        Another purpose of literature is self-expression.  Again, this purpose becomes 
easily overlooked in the commonly held belief that you and I, the readers of 
literature, could &quot;never write like that.&quot;  It is true that we may never write great 
literature.  However, all human beings are capable of expressing themselves in the 
symbols of language, and literature--be it high literature or low--is an exemplar of 
such self-expression.  Avid readers often feel the urge to become writers themselves, 
and everyone has his or her own story to tell, even if it is just for family or 
friends or even just an audience of one--the reader himself.  Such self-expression is 
healing, thoughtful, powerful, explorative, and interesting.  And reading great 
literature offers readers the tools for such self-expression:  one learns the elements 
of literature, and then he or she can practice them. 
</P>
<P>        A final important purpose of literature is that it helps people discover 
themselves.  It gives readers insight into their feelings, thoughts, pasts, futures, 
and ultimate values.  In a sense literature is perhaps the oldest and most common form 
of psychology, one available to readers of all abilities and interests.  And if 
literature is like having a psychologist on the shelf, ready to take down and read 
whenever one wishes, great literature is like a great psychologist, giving important 
insights to readers that were previously unavailable to them. 

</P>
<P><u><b><font size="4">Becoming a Literary Critic</font></b></u> 
</P>
<P>        In the field of literature, there are those who create it and those who review 
and examine it.  Reviewers and examiners of literature play a function similar to 
historians:  they are the people who evaluate what has happened in a piece of 
literature once it has been written.  Often they also determine the degree to which it 
will be accepted or rejected.  If, for example, a literary work is not accepted for 
review by media critics, often the literary work is never heard of again.  Everyone 
has heard stories of some literary work that the critics ignore, but it becomes 
popular through the &quot;underground&quot;--by being passed from person to person.  This
happens on occasion.  However, the great majority of literary works that become even 
somewhat known must not only be accepted by editors but also by media critics.  And 
those works of literature that become part of the accepted &quot;canon&quot;--the group or 
groups of literary works that educational institutions recommend for reading and 
teachers choose for teaching--such works of literature usually are analyzed and 
evaluated in dozens and even hundreds of articles in scholarly and professional 
teachers' journals. 
</P>
<P>        Those who are professionals in the field of criticizing literature have two 
primary methods of communicating their analyses.  One can understand how professional 
critics think by looking at each of these two primary methods of thinking. 
        </P>
<P>        The first method is used by media critics.  It is a literary review.  Though 
there are many variations of literary reviews, basically the reviewer works in three 
stages or steps as he or she describes the literary work, interprets some of its 
meanings, and then evaluates.  Here is a summary of each of the three steps, then a 
brief example of how these work:&nbsp;
</P>
<P><b>DESCRIPTIONS</b>:  Observe and describe the literary work factually by its elements and 
                    structures.  Start with the simplest elements such as language use 
                    (rhythms, rhymes, types of words chosen by the author), types of 
                    description (use of the five senses, colorfulness or lack of it in 
                    describing characters and scenes, etc.), and tone and style 
                    (humorous, serious, highbrow, lowbrow, ironic, pedantic, light, 
                    heavy, etc.).  Then move to the larger elements:  obvious symbols, 
                    secondary and main characters, plots (external and internal), 
                    subplots, and/or overall structure.  
</P>
<P><b>INTERPRETATIONS</b>:  Suggest possible interpretations that both readers and the author 
                    might possibly have of the literary work.  Interpretations may 
                    include less obvious and/or overall symbols, competing possible 
                    meanings of characters, a variety of competing themes or meanings
that readers may perceive in this work.  Competing 
                    interpretations are good. 
</P>
<P><b>EVALUATIONS</b>:  This is what media reviewers are famous for.  Evaluation means, 
                    basically, what is good and bad about the piece. Evaluatve 
                    questions might include such subjects as the ethical or moral 
                    value of a literary work, its aesthetic or artistic appeal, what 
                    it will do for or to people, its honesty or accuracy of portrayal, 
                    its emotional appeal, and whether it is essentially ugly, 
                    pedestrian, or beautiful. 
</P>
<P>        Here is the example using the system above:
</P>
<blockquote>
  <P><u>Descriptions</u>: <i>The Color Purple</i> by Alice Walker uses colorful visual and physically 
                    sensual images in particular, with some emphasis on vivid slang to 
                    convey the sometimes brutal, sometimes beautiful life of a woman 
                    who is abused as a child and young woman.  The tone is down to 
                    earth, almost overwhelmingly so, yet the style, while containing 
                    simple sentences that makes the book easy to read, flows smoothly 
                    and often takes flight, wringing emotions out of characters and
the reader alike.  Purple becomes a central symbol for the life of 
                    the main character and of women (and men) in general, as do such 
                    moving and central physical objects as blood, fists, rocking 
                    chairs, and a host of other details.  The main characters are....  
                    Memorable secondary characters include....  The basic plot of the 
                    story is.... 
</P>
<P><u>Interpretations</u>:  The obvious theme of this novel, many would argue--feminists in 
                    particular--is that women (white as well as black) can rise above 
                    their abuse at the hands at men and become whole again, no matter 
                    how deep and how sever that abuse has been.  However, others might 
                    argue that this theme of rising above pain is not limited to women 
                    but exists for men, too.  Some would argue (and the community of 
                    African-American males in this country have done so) that this 
                    novel portrays black men as insubstantial and unappealing power 
                    mongers who must be put in their place.  Yet a closer look reveals 
                    that strong men also exist in this novel, and even the weak men 
                    may become more whole with help.  Other interpretations 
                    include.... 
</P>
<P><u>Evaluations</u>:  The impact of this novel may be so great that it is difficult to 
                    calculate.  Not only does it give voice to a segment of society 
                    too long voiceless (or at least too long oppressed to be heard 
                    well)--African-American women--but also in its sweeping simplicity 
                    it will attract and powerfully affect both men and women of all 
                    races and generations.  Will the impact be good?  Some argue its 
                    portrayal of black men is unfair, but this critic thinks this 
                    evaluation is incomplete at best, and unfair at worst:  if Tom 
                    Jones and his like can cavort so freely in literature, it also is 
                    reasonable and just to see the female side of suffering caused by 
                    males.  This novel, in fact, becomes an ethical encouragement--
                    not for its negative portrayal of men but rather its positive 
                    portrayal of how women and their men eventually can come to terms 
                    with each other.  Other effects of this novel are....

<P>        A literary critic who is an academic professional works differently.  He or 
she emphasizes interpretation, and does so by choosing a particular way of viewing the 
meaning of a book.  Then the academic critic will argue for this interpretation.  For 
example, two different academic critics might argue that THE COLOR PURPLE is or is not 
primarily a work of African-American feminism--or, for example, that the book does a 
good or bad job of portraying men. 
</P>
<P>        Academic critics often identify with certain schools of thought within their 
own literary discipline.  As explained above, critics may be feminist, psychological, 
political (especially Marxist), form critics, or one among a number of other types. 
Each academic critic starts with a different point of view and then tries to argue 
this point of view in important literary works.  Here is how it is done:&nbsp;
</P>
<P><b>A.  START WITH A POINT OF VIEW</b>.  The best way to do this is to work with
an interpretation that is unique or different from what others will see in a 
        literary work.  Your personal experience or personal studies may help you:
for example, if you have experienced being poor, black, and female yourself, 
        you may have some interesting interpretations to make of <i>The Color
Purple</i> because of this personal experience.  Likewise, if you have studied the 
        sociology of poor, rural southerners in the earlier part of this century, you 
        may have some points to make about <i>The Color Purple</i> that transcend race 
        and/or gender that few other readers would perceive. 
</P>
<P>        <b>B.  THEN FIND PASSAGES IN THE LITERARY WORK THAT SUPPORT THIS
POINT</b>.  You can pick details from various parts of the plot or 
        progression of the story, you can pick certain characters or certain traits, 
        actions, or words by certain characters, you can pick symbols, descriptions, 
        or other use of language--or any mixture of these you wish.  
</P>
<P>        <b>C.  ORGANIZE THESE SUPPORTING POINTS INTO THE STEPS OF AN ARGUMENT</b>.  Make your basic, overall interpretive point in the very 
        beginning of your essay; then start arguing using your supports, step by step, 
        usually putting your strongest proofs first and your weakest proofs later. 
</P>
<P><font size="4"><b><u>Exercises</u></b></font> 
     </P>
<P><u>Exercise 1</u> 
     </P>
<P>        Name the best book, movie, play, or poem you have ever read or seen, something
that affected you deeply and even, perhaps, changed your life in some way.  How did 
it affect you?  Why?  Why do you think it might qualify as literature--a work of art? 
</P>
<P>        What part of culture and time was this book?  That is, what part of American 
or foreign culture, society, politics, and geographical area does it fit into?  Why--
what tells you this?  How does this relate to your own culture and time, the one you 
are living now or that you have lived in this life? 
</P>
<P>        How does this particular piece of literature fit in with your own personal 
philosophy?  Why?  How did it change, strengthen, or weaken your personal philosophy 
of life? 

</P>
<P><u>Exercise 2</u> 
     </P>
<P>        If you could design a piece of great literature, any piece at all, who would 
you want as the hero or heroine?   Why?   Who or what would you have as obstacles or 
resistances?  Why?  How would these obstacles or resistances hinder the hero/heroine?  
What would be the very worst obstacle/resistance?  Why is it the worst?  What kind of 
emotions would you expect your hero/heroine to have?  Your readers to have?  Why? 

</P>
<P><u>Exercise 3</u> 
</P>
<P>        Use the following formula to create three different symbols of three different 
people or events. 
</P>
<P>        ______________ is like a __________ because (person/event)                (symbol) 
</P>
<P>        both are ____________, ____________, and ____________. 
</P>
<P>(Example:  Love is like a rose: both are pretty to see and sweet to smell, and both 
have thorns.) 

</P>
<P><u>Exercise 4</u> 
</P>
<P>        Write a 50-100 word rough-draft description of a special person or event
with a strong emotional meaning to you.  Then try to rewrite each sentence into 
one or two lines of poetry.  Each line should have just one image several words in 
length, as in the examples in the poetry section in this chapter. 

</P>
<P><u>Exercise 5</u> 
</P>
<P>        Start with your 50-100 word rough draft from Exercise 4 above.  Rewrite it by 
triple spacing it (by hand or printer); then, using carats (/\) and/or arrows, add 
descriptions by adding single words, phrases, and or whole sentences.  Add each of the 
five senses at least once, and nearer the beginning write--or add--the five W's of 
journalism that you do not already have.  (You may, if you wish, check the formula 
example, &quot;Jack and Jill,&quot; in the section above discussing this type of description, 
and copy the sentence, inserting your own applicable W's as you copy.)  Finally,
between the lines or in another section, add some dialogue:  have two characters 
discussing a subject that is upsetting to them or arguing with each other. 

</P>
<P><u>Exercise 6</u> 
</P>
<P>        It is said that everyone has at least one great story in them--something so 
full of difficulty, pain, love, heartbreak, striving, or other deep feelings and 
experiences that almost everyone can relate to this story.  What is your greatest 
story?  Why?  It also is said that to be a good literary writer, one must on some 
level be an exhibitionist.  Why is this statement made?  What does it have to do with 
telling your own great story? 

</P>
<P><u>Exercise 7</u> 
</P>
<P>        As a class, choose a short story or a poem of at least eight or ten lines to 
read either at home or in class.  Then discuss this literary piece by examining its 
elements:  start with the smaller, simpler elements such as language (rhythms and 
rhymes of words and the types of words chosen by the author), the types of description 
(types of five senses; use of the five W's), and the tone and style--humorous,
serious, 
impatient, quiet, loud, intellectual, highly accessible, et al.)  Record your opinions 
together on a blackboard--alternate opinions are valuable.  Then discuss larger 
matters:  the existence and meaning of symbols, and the nature of the characters, 
their depth, and their importance.  Finally, discuss the most encompassing elements of 
all such as the plot (including external and internal), subplots, and possible themes. 

</P>
<P><u>Exercise 8</u> 

</P>
<P>        In small groups, construct the outline of either a critical review or an 
academic criticism of some work of literature--or even a movie or play--that everyone 
in the group has read or seen.  Share this construction with the rest of the class. 


</P>
<P>        <u>Exercise 9</u> 


</P>
<P>        Name a significant problem you once had (but no longer have).&nbsp;
Name how you solved it.&nbsp; You now have the basic structure of a story:
person (you), problem, and solution.&nbsp; Write one &quot;scene&quot; that
shows by example the problem or solution.&nbsp; Make your scene appear as a
scene in a movie--use descriptive words, action, and/or dialogue to show exactly
what happened in just one place at one time.
