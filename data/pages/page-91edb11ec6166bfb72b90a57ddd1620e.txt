A History of Ancient Greece</font></b></p>

<p><b><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">GREEK LITERATURE</font></b></p>

<font face="Times New Roman">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>

<font face="Arial">
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">The great British philosopher-mathematician Alfred 
North Whitehead once commented that all philosophy is but a footnote to Plato . 
A similar point can be made regarding Greek literature as a whole. </font></b> </p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Over a period of more than ten centuries, the ancient 
Greeks created a literature of such brilliance that it has rarely been equaled 
and never surpassed. In poetry, tragedy, comedy, and history, Greek writers 
created masterpieces that have inspired, influenced, and challenged readers to 
the present day.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">To suggest that all Western literature is no more than 
a footnote to the writings of classical Greece is an exaggeration, but it is 
nevertheless true that the Greek world of thought was so far-ranging that there 
is scarcely an idea discussed today that was not debated by the ancient writers. 
The only body of literature of comparable influence is the Bible.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The language in which the ancient authors wrote was 
Greek. Like English, Greek is an Indo-European language; but it is far older. 
Its history can be followed from the 14th century BC to the present. Its 
literature, therefore, covers a longer period of time than that of any other 
Indo-European language </font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">Scholars have determined that the Greek alphabet was 
derived from the Phoenician alphabet. During the period from the 8th to the 5th 
century BC, local differences caused the forms of letters to vary from one 
city-state to another within Greece. From the 4th century BC on, however, the 
alphabet became uniform throughout the Greek world.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<b>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2">CLASSICAL PERIOD</font></p>
</b>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;There are four major periods of Greek literature: 
preclassical, classical, Hellenistic-Roman, and Byzantine. Of these the most 
significant works were produced during the preclassical and classical eras.</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><font color="#000000">&nbsp;Epic Tradition&nbsp;</font></b></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two 
monumental works of Homer, the 'Iliad' and the 'Odyssey'. The figure of Homer is 
shrouded in mystery. Although the works as they now stand are credited to him, 
it is certain that their roots reach far back before his time.&nbsp; The 'Iliad' is 
the famous story about the Trojan War. It centers on the person of Achilles, who 
embodied the Greek heroic ideal.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">While the 'Iliad' is pure tragedy, the 'Odyssey' is a 
mixture of tragedy and comedy. It is the story of Odysseus, one of the warriors 
at Troy. After ten years fighting the war, he spends another ten years sailing 
back home to his wife and family. During his ten-year voyage, he loses all of 
his comrades and ships and makes his way home to Ithaca disguised as a beggar.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Both of these works were based on ancient legends. The 
stories are told in language that is simple, direct, and eloquent. Both are as 
fascinatingly readable today as they were in ancient Greece.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The other great poet of the preclassical period was 
Hesiod. He is more definitely recorded in history than is Homer, though very 
little is known about him. He was a native of Boeotia in central Greece, and he 
lived and worked in about 800 BC. His two works were 'Works and Days' and 'Theogony'.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The first is a faithful depiction of the dull and 
poverty-stricken country life he knew so well, and it sets forth principles and 
rules for farmers. 'Theogony' is a systematic account of creation and of the 
gods. It vividly describes the ages of mankind, beginning with a long-past 
golden age.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Together the works of Homer and Hesiod made a kind of 
bible for the Greeks. Homer told the story of a heroic past, and Hesiod dealt 
with the practical realities of daily life. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;Lyric Poetry</font></p>
</b>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;The type of poetry called lyric got its name from the 
fact that it was originally sung by individuals or a chorus accompanied by the 
instrument called the lyre. The first of the lyric poets was probably 
Archilochus of Paros about 700 BC. Only fragments remain of his work, as is the 
case with most of the poets. The few remnants suggest that he was an embittered 
adventurer who led a very turbulent life.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The two major poets were Sappho and Pindar. Sappho, who 
lived in the period from 610 to 580 BC, has always been admired for the beauty 
of her writing. Her themes were personal. They dealt with her friendships with 
and dislikes of other women, though her brother Charaxus was the subject of 
several poems. Unfortunately, only fragments of her poems remain.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">With Pindar the transition has been made from the 
preclassical to the classical age. He was born about 518 BC and is considered 
the greatest of the Greek lyricists. His masterpieces were the poems that 
celebrated athletic victories in the games at Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, and the 
Isthmus of Corinth.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;Tragedy</font></p>
</b>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;The Greeks invented the epic and lyric forms and used 
them skillfully. They also invented drama and produced masterpieces that are 
still reckoned as drama's crowning achievement. In the age that followed the 
defeat of Persia (490 to 479 BC), the awakened national spirit of Athens was 
expressed in hundreds of superb tragedies based on heroic and legendary themes 
of the past. (<i>See also</i> Drama.)</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The tragic plays grew out of simple choral songs and 
dialogues performed at festivals of the god Dionysus. Wealthy citizens were 
chosen to bear the expense of costuming and training the chorus as a public and 
religious duty. Attendance at the festival performances was regarded as an act 
of worship. Performances were held in the great open-air theater of Dionysus in 
Athens. All of the greatest poets competed for the prizes offered for the best 
plays.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Of the hundreds of dramas written and performed during 
the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have 
survived: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The earliest of the three was 
Aeschylus, who was born in 525 BC. He wrote between 70 and 90 plays, of which 
only seven remain. Many of his dramas were arranged as trilogies, groups of 
three plays on a single theme. The 'Oresteia' (story of Orestes)--consisting of 
'Agamemnon', 'Choephoroi' (Libation-bearers), and 'Eumenides' (Furies)--is the 
only surviving trilogy. The 'Persai' is a song of triumph for the defeat of the 
Persians (<i>see</i> Persian Wars). 'Prometheus Bound' is a retelling of the 
legend of the Titan Prometheus, a superhuman who stole fire from heaven and gave 
it to mankind. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">For about 16 years, between 484 and 468 BC, Aeschylus 
carried off prize after prize. But in 468 his place was taken by a new favorite, 
Sophocles of Colonus (496-406). Sophocles' life covered nearly the whole period 
of Athens' &quot;golden age.&quot; He won more than 20 victories at the Dionysian 
festivals and produced more than 100 plays, only seven of which remain. His 
drama 'Antigone' is typical of his work: its heroine is a model of womanly 
self-sacrifice. He is probably better known, though, for 'Oedipus Rex' and its 
sequel, 'Oedipus at Colonus'.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The third of the great tragic writers was Euripides 
(484-406). He wrote at least 92 plays. Sixty-seven of these are known in the 
20th century--some just in part or by name only. Only 19 still exist in full. 
One of these is 'Rhesus', which is believed by some scholars not to have been 
written by Euripides. His tragedies are about real men and women instead of 
idealized figures.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">The philosopher Aristotle called Euripides the most 
tragic of the poets because his plays were the most moving. His dramas are 
performed on the modern stage more often than those of any other ancient poet. 
His best-known work is probably the powerful 'Medea', but his 'Alcestis', 'Hippolytus', 
'Trojan Women', 'Orestes', and 'Electra' are no less brilliant &nbsp;</font></b></p>
<b>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Comedy</font></p>
</b>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;Like tragedy, comedy arose from a ritual in honor of 
Dionysus, but in this case the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and 
insult. At Athens the comedies became an official part of the festival 
celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">As with the tragedians, few works still remain of the 
great comedic writers. Of the works of earlier writers, only some plays by 
Aristophanes exist. These are a treasure trove of comic presentation. He poked 
fun at everyone and every institution.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">For boldness of fantasy, for merciless insult, for 
unqualified indecency, and for outrageous and free political criticism, there is 
nothing to compare to the comedies of Aristophanes. In 'The Birds' he held up 
Athenian democracy to ridicule. In 'The Clouds' he attacked the philosopher 
Socrates. In 'Lysistrata' he denounced war. Only 11 of his plays have survived. 
(<i>See also</i> Aristophanes.)</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">During the 4th century BC, there developed what was 
called the New Comedy. Menander is considered the best of its writers. Nothing 
remains from his competitors, however, so it is difficult to make comparisons. 
The plays of Menander, of which only the 'Dyscolus' (Misanthrope) now exists, 
did not deal with the great public themes about which Aristophanes wrote. He 
concentrated instead on fictitious characters from everyday life--stern fathers, 
young lovers, intriguing slaves, and others. In spite of his narrower focus, the 
plays of Menander influenced later generations. They were freely adapted by the 
Roman poets Plautus and Terence in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. The comedies of 
the French playwright Moliere are reminiscent of those by Menander</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><font color="#000000">&nbsp;History&nbsp;</font></b></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Two of the most excellent historians who have ever 
written flourished during Greece's classical age: Herodotus and Thucydides. 
Herodotus is commonly called the father of history, and his 'History' contains 
the first truly literary use of prose in Western literature (<i>see</i> 
Herodotus).</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Of the two, Thucydides was the better historian. His 
critical use of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his 
'History of the Peloponnesian War' a significant influence on later generations 
of historians (<i>see</i> Thucydides).</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">A third historian, Xenophon, began his 'Hellenica' 
where Thucydides ended his work about 411 BC and carried his history to 362 BC. 
His writings were superficial in comparison to those of Thucydides, but he wrote 
with authority on military matters. He therefore is at his best in the 
'Anabasis', an account of his participation in a Greek mercenary army that tried 
to help the Persian Cyrus expel his brother from the throne. Xenophon also wrote 
three works in praise of the philosopher Socrates--'Apology', 'Symposium', and 
'Memorabilia' (Recollections of Socrates). Although both Xenophon and Plato knew 
Socrates, their accounts are very different, and it is interesting to compare 
the view of the military historian to that of the poet-philosopher.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;Philosophy</font></p>
</b>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was 
in philosophy. There were many Greek philosophers, but three names tower above 
the rest: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. It is impossible to calculate the 
enormous influence these thinkers have had on Western society (<i>see</i> 
Philosophy). Socrates himself wrote nothing, but his thought (or a reasonable 
presentation of it) has been preserved in the 'Dialogues' of Plato. Even in 
translation, Plato's style is one of matchless beauty. All human experience is 
within its range. Best known of the 'Dialogues' is the 'Republic', a fairly long 
work. There are also many shorter books--such as the 'Apology', 'Protagoras', 
and 'Gorgias'--that contain the penetratingly insightful conversations of 
Socrates and his friends on every matter relating to human behavior. (<i>See 
also</i> Plato; Socrates.)</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">In the history of human thought, Aristotle is virtually 
without rivals. The first sentence of his 'Metaphysics' reads: &quot;All men by 
nature desire to know.&quot; He has, therefore, been called the &quot;Father of those who 
know.&quot; His medieval disciple Thomas Aquinas referred to him simply as &quot;the 
Philosopher.&quot;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Aristotle was a student at Plato's Academy, and it is 
known that--like his teacher--he wrote dialogues, or conversations. None of 
these exists today. The body of writings that has come down to the present 
probably represents lectures that he delivered at his own school in Athens, the 
Lyceum. Even from these books the enormous range of his interests is evident. He 
explored matters other than those that are today considered philosophical. The 
treatises that exist cover logic, the physical and biological sciences, ethics, 
politics, and constitutional government. There are also treatises on 'The Soul' 
and 'Rhetoric'. His 'Poetics' has had an enormous influence on literary theory 
and served as an interpretation of tragedy for more than 2,000 years. (<i>See 
also</i> Aristotle.)</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">With the death of Aristotle in 322 BC, the classical 
era of Greek literature drew to a close. In the successive centuries of Greek 
writing there was never again such a brilliant flowering of genius as appeared 
in the 5th and 4th centuries BC.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">For today's readers there are excellent modern 
translations of classical Greek literature. Most are available in paperback 
editions.</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><font color="#000000">&nbsp;HELLENISTIC-ROMAN PERIOD&nbsp;</font></b></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">By 338 BC all of the Greek city-states except Sparta 
had been conquered by Philip II of Macedon. Greece was not independent again 
until the early 19th century, a period of more than 2,000 years. Philip's son 
Alexander the Great extended his father's conquests greatly. In so doing he 
inaugurated what is called the Age of Hellenism. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The Greek word for Greece was <i>Hellas.</i> Hellenism, 
therefore, signifies the spread of Greek language, literature, and culture 
throughout the Mediterranean world. Alexander's conquests were in the East, and 
Greek culture shifted first in that direction. Athens lost its preeminent status 
as the leader of Greek culture, and it was replaced temporarily by Alexandria, 
Egypt. After the rise of Rome, all the Mediterranean area was brought within one 
far-flung empire. Greek civilization then spread westward as well. Educated 
Romans learned to speak and write Greek, and they looked to Greece's golden age 
for inspiration in philosophy, poetry, and drama. So dependent did Roman writers 
become, in fact, that they produced very little that was not based upon Greek 
works, especially in drama and philosophy.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;Library of Alexandria</font></p>
</b>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;The city of Alexandria in northern Egypt became, from 
the 3rd century BC, the outstanding center of Greek culture. It also soon 
attracted a large Jewish population, making it the largest center for Jewish 
scholarship in the ancient world. In addition, it later became a major focal 
point for the development of Christian thought.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The Museum, or Shrine to the Muses, which included the 
library and school, was founded by Ptolemy I. The institution was from the 
beginning intended as a great international school and library. The library, 
eventually containing more than a half million volumes, was mostly in Greek. It 
served as a repository for every Greek work of the classical period that could 
be found. Had the library lasted, it would have presented to modern scholars 
nearly every ancient book for study. The library lasted for several centuries 
but was destroyed during the reign of the Roman emperor Aurelian late in the 3rd 
century AD. A smaller library was destroyed by the Christians in 391 because it 
harbored so many non-Christian works.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;Hellenistic Poetry</font></p>
</b>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;Later Greek poetry flourished primarily in the 3rd 
century BC. The chief poets were Theocritus, Callimachus, and Apollonius of 
Rhodes.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Theocritus, who lived from about 310 to 250 BC, was the 
creator of pastoral poetry, a type that the Roman Virgil mastered in his 
'Eclogues'. Of his rural-farm poetry, 'Harvest Home' is considered the best 
work. He also wrote mimes--poetic plays set in the country--as well as minor 
epics and lyric poetry.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Callimachus, who lived at the same time as Theocritus, 
worked his entire adult life at Alexandria, where he was cataloger of the 
library. Only fragments of his poetry survive. The most famous work was 'Aetia' 
(Causes). It is a kind of poem called an elegy and in four books explains the 
legendary origin of obscure customs, festivals, and names. Its structure became 
a model for the work of the Roman poet Ovid. Of his elegies for special 
occasions, the best known is the 'Lock of Berenice', a piece of court poetry 
that was later adapted by the Roman Catullus. Callimachus also wrote short poems 
for special occasions and at least one short epic, the 'Ibis', which was 
directed against his former pupil Apollonius.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Apollonius of Rhodes was born about 295 BC. He is best 
remembered for his epic the 'Argonautica', about Jason and his shipmates in 
search of the golden fleece. Apollonius studied under Callimachus, with whom he 
later quarreled. He also served as librarian at Alexandria for about 13 years. 
Apart from the 'Argonautica', he wrote poems on the foundation of cities as well 
as a number of epigrams. The Roman poet Virgil was strongly influenced by the 'Argonautica' 
in writing his 'Aeneid' (<i>see</i> Virgil).</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Lesser 3rd-century poets include Aratus of Soli and 
Herodas. Aratus wrote the 'Phaenomena', a poetic version of a treatise on the 
stars by Eudoxus of Cnidos, who had lived in the 4th century. Herodas wrote 
mimes reminiscent of those of Theocritus. His works give a hint of the popular 
entertainment of the times. Mime and pantomime were a major form of 
entertainment during the early Roman Empire.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;Hellenistic Prose</font></p>
</b>
<p><font size="2"><b><font color="#000000">&nbsp;History.</font></b></font><b><font size="2" color="#000000"> The 
significant historians in the period after Alexander were Timaeus, Polybius, 
Diodorus Siculus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Appian of Alexandria, Arrian, and 
Plutarch. The period of time they cover extended from late in the 4th century BC 
to the 2nd century AD.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Timaeus was born in Sicily but spent most of his life 
in Athens. His 'History', though lost, is significant because of its influence 
on Polybius. In 38 books it covered the history of Sicily and Italy to the year 
264 BC, which is where Polybius began his work. Timaeus also wrote the 'Olympionikai', 
a valuable chronological study of the Olympic Games.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Polybius was born about 200 BC. He was brought to Rome 
as a hostage in 168. At Rome he became a friend of the general Scipio Aemilianus. 
He probably accompanied the general to Spain and North Africa in the wars 
against Carthage. He was with Scipio at the destruction of Carthage in 146. The 
history on which his reputation rests consisted of 40 books, five of which have 
been preserved along with various excerpts. They are a vivid recreation of 
Rome's rise to world power. A lost book, 'Tactics', was on military matters.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Diodorus Siculus lived in the 1st century BC, the time 
of Julius Caesar and Augustus. He wrote a universal history, 'Bibliotheca 
historica', in 40 books. Of these, the first five and the 11th through the 20th 
remain. The first two parts covered history through the early Hellenistic era. 
The third part takes the story to the beginning of Caesar's wars in Gaul, now 
France.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Dionysius of Halicarnassus lived late in the 1st 
century BC. His history of Rome from its origins to the First Punic War (264 to 
241 BC) is written from a Roman point of view, but it is carefully researched. 
He also wrote a number of other treatises, including 'On Imitation', 
'Commentaries on the Ancient Orators', and 'On the Arrangement of Words'.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Appian and Arrian both lived in the 2nd century AD. 
Appian wrote on Rome and its conquests, while Arrian is remembered for his work 
on the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Arrian served in the Roman army. His 
book therefore concentrates heavily on the military aspects of Alexander's life. 
Arrian also wrote a philosophical treatise, the 'Diatribai', based on the 
teachings of his mentor Epictetus </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Best known of the late Greek historians to modern 
readers is Plutarch, who died about AD 119. His 'Parallel Lives' of great Greek 
and Roman leaders has been read by every generation since the work was first 
published. His other surviving work is the 'Moralia', a collection of essays on 
ethical, religious, political, physical, and literary topics.</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><font color="#000000">&nbsp;Science and mathematics.</font></b></font><b><font size="2" color="#000000">
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Eratosthenes of Alexandria, who died about 194 BC, 
wrote on astronomy and geography, but his work is known mainly from later 
summaries. He is credited with being the first person to measure the Earth's 
circumference.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Much that was written by the mathematicians Euclid and 
Archimedes has been preserved. Euclid is known for his 'Elements', much of which 
was drawn from his predecessor Eudoxus of Cnidus. The 'Elements' is a treatise 
on geometry, and it has exerted a continuing influence on mathematics. </font>
</b>
</p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">From Archimedes several treatises have come down to the 
present. Among them are 'Measurement of the Circle', in which he worked out the 
value of <i>pi</i>; 'Method Concerning Mechanical Theorems', on his work in 
mechanics; 'The Sand-Reckoner'; and 'On Floating Bodies'. </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The physician Galen, in the history of ancient science, 
is the most significant person in medicine after Hippocrates, who laid the 
foundation of medicine in the 5th century BC. Galen lived during the 2nd century 
AD. He was a careful student of anatomy, and his works exerted a powerful 
influence on medicine for the next 1,400 years </font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Strabo, who died about AD 23, was a geographer and 
historian. His 'Historical Sketches' in 47 volumes has nearly all been lost. His 
'Geographical Sketches' remain as the only existing ancient book covering the 
whole range of people and countries known to the Greeks and Romans through the 
time of Augustus.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Pausanias, who lived in the 2nd century AD, was also a 
geographer. His 'Description of Greece' is an invaluable guide to what are now 
ancient ruins. His book takes the form of a tour of Greece, starting in Athens. 
The accuracy of his descriptions has been proved by archaeological excavations.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The scientist of the Roman period who had the greatest 
influence on later generations was undoubtedly the astronomer Ptolemy. He lived 
during the 2nd century AD, though little is known of his life. His masterpiece, 
originally entitled 'The Mathematical Collection', has come to the present under 
the title 'Almagest', as it was translated by Arab astronomers with that title.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">It was Ptolemy who devised a detailed description of an 
Earth-centered universe, an erroneous notion that dominated astronomical 
thinking for more than 1,300 years. The Ptolemaic view of the universe endured 
until the early modern astronomers Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler overturned 
it.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<b>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2">The Septuagint.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">One of the most valuable contributions of the 
Hellenistic period was the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek. The work 
was done at Alexandria and completed by the end of the 2nd century BC. The name 
Septuagint means &quot;seventy,&quot; from the tradition that there were 72 scholars who 
did the work. Since the language of the early Christian community was Greek, the 
Septuagint became its Bible. Other books not in the Hebrew Bible were also 
written in Greek and included what is called the Apocrypha.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<b>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Philosophy</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">Later philosophical works were no match for Plato and 
Aristotle. Epictetus, who died about AD 135, was associated with the moral 
philosophy of the Stoics. His teachings were collected by his pupil Arrian in 
the 'Discourses' and the 'Encheiridion' (Manual of Study). Diogenes Laertius, 
who lived in the 3rd century, wrote 'Lives, Teachings, and Sayings of Famous 
Philosophers', a useful sourcebook. Another major philosopher was Plotinus. He, 
too, lived in the 3rd century. He transformed Plato's philosophy into a school 
called Neoplatonism. His 'Enneads' had a wide-ranging influence on European 
thought until at least the 17th century.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<b>
<p><font color="#000000" size="2">BYZANTINE LITERATURE</font></p>
</b>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;Constantine the Great moved the capital of the empire 
from Rome to Byzantium (now Istanbul) in about AD 330 and renamed the city 
Constantinople. The Eastern, or Byzantine, Empire lasted until it was destroyed 
by the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . The civilization of this empire was Greek in 
language and heritage, but it was Christian in religion.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">In religion the crowning literary achievement was 
considered to be the New Testament portion of the Christian Bible. This, coupled 
with a reverence for the great literary traditions of the past, combined to make 
Byzantine literature very conservative. The written language had to preserve the 
forms of speech of the New Testament and the Church Fathers. Being heirs to such 
a great literary tradition excluded any interest in outside ideas.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">This undue emphasis on form smothered any likelihood of 
originality and invention. The literary creations of the period have, therefore, 
bequeathed few memorable works to the present.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">Much of the writing was necessarily religious: sermons, 
hymns, theological works, and descriptions of the lives of the martyrs and 
saints. Of the few authors who are still read may be mentioned Eusebius (died 
340), who wrote the first church history; St. Basil the Great (died 379), who 
organized Eastern monasticism; his brother Gregory of Nyssa (died 394), who 
wrote many works in which he combined Platonic philosophy with Christian 
teaching; and Gregory of Nazianzus (died 389), who is noted for his poems, 
sermons, letters, and writings on theological controversies.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The writings of the historians, geographers, 
philosophers, scientists, and rhetoricians are read today largely as curiosities 
or as sources of historical information. A work such as 'Byzantine History', a 
37-volume study by Nicephorus Gregoras (died 1360), for example, constitutes a 
valuable primary source for the 14th century.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">In philosophy only Proclus (died 485) deserves mention. 
He was the last major Greek philosopher and was influential in spreading the 
ideas of Neoplatonism throughout the Mediterranean world.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">The only literature that showed any real originality 
was that written in the vernacular, the language of the common people. This 
literature--including poems, romances, and epics--was only written from the 12th 
century onward. Of the epics, the most memorable is the story of Digenis Akritas, 
based on a historical figure who died in about 788. It presents Akritas as the 
ideal medieval Greek hero.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000" size="2">After the capture of Constantinople by the Turks, Greek 
national life and culture ended for centuries, as did literary production. It 
was only revived when Greece became independent in 1829 </font></b></p>
