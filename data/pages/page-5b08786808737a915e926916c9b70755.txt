<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
hit foreign film of the late 1980s, <i>Cinema Paradiso,</i> provides a
marvelous metaphor for our current international predicament.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The movie wonderfully demonstrates how our
collective obsession with automobiles has savaged our cities and diminished our
sense of place and community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
central character within the movie is the Paradiso cinema, located on a
generous <i>piazza</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in a small town
in Sicily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The movie house, along with
the church, provide, not only the dominant architectural features of the <i>piazza</i>,
but also provide the heart and soul, respectively, of the community.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The <i>piazza<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></i>of 1954 existed as the hierarchical gathering space for the
town, with its open market, cultural festivals, and even an outdoor movie
screening space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the movie, people
continually traverse the space by foot, bicycle, and horse-drawn cart.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Upon the protagonists return to the town in
the 1980s, the once glorious urban space had been usurped by modern
progress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pedestrians are scarce as
cars speed across the <i>piazza</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>dodging the multitude of parked vehicles.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The former projectionist, turned famous movie director, appears
devastated to see the Paradiso condemned for demolition, only to be replaced
with a parking lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the final scene,
we see the theater blasted to smithereens in the background, the weeping
nostalgic crowds in the middle ground, and, in the foreground, the rooftops of
Fiats and Volkswagons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Although
the film ostensibly presents a general critique of modern industrial society,
in the forefront is the burgeoning obsession with the <i>machina</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Sicilian towns identity and sense of
community was lost with the compromise of the <i>piazza</i>..<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Crucial public space had been handed over,
free of charge, to the priviledged few who could afford an automobile.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unfortunately, this is the typical state of
affairs in Americas cities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
(de)evolution in transportation was not a natural progression.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The rise of the automobiles popularity was
greatly encouraged by obstinate politicians and profit-motivated
corporations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Additionally, the
complicity of modernist urban planners and architects, dehumanized traffic
engineers, and demagogue developers cannot be ignored.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their collective post-war creation has left
us with a mountain of debt, a sprawling suburban ooze, polluted and crumbling
inner cities, and a landscape devoid of farmland and forests.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All in all, ours is the landscape of
subtraction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cars have contributed
nothing to our urban condition, our communities, and our environment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They have only taken away.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What started out as a promise for a better
life based on unlimited mobility, has become a modern day obsession, as
solitary commuters idle in endless traffic jams wondering where all of the cars
came from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Owning
and driving an automobile has become a prerequisite for conformity in our
popular culture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To not drive in
America is seen as aberrant behavior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Using mass transit is for people too poor to own an automobile, or for
big city dwellers who deem the auto commute inefficient.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Riding a bicycle is seen as either a
recreational act, or only as a method for children and pre-teens to get
around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Walking on a country road or a
suburban strip, where seldom doth a sidewalk appear, immediately elicits
suspicion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Surely only a lunatic or
a criminal would do such a thing.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the land of apple pie, every normal citizen gets around by
car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After World War II, buying a
suburban bungalow was even considered a patriotic act.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>William Levitt, the Long Island developer
for whom Levittown was named said, The suburban homeowner could never be a
communist . . . He has too much to do!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The aphorisms, no one messes with a mans set of wheels, or whats
good for GM is good for America has incredible power in our culture. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
indoctrination into our auto-dominated culture begins at very early age.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Children play with toy cars and trucks.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They build miniature suburbs with Tonka
trucks and cranes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every Barbie doll or
G.I. Joe figurine needs the accompanying vehicle to be a complete set.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many childrens toy vehicles are ornamented
to appear like cars, even though mechanically, they are similar to
bicycles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many young boys build
miniature race tracks of plastic, emulating the stock-car racers seen on T.V.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time these children become teenagers,
they will have their sights set on that 16th birthday with the drivers license
soon to follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Who can blame
them?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With many living in suburbs
spread so thinly, bicycle trips become impractical, and mass transit is
non-existent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those priviledged enough,
will receive a car from their parents as a gift.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Most others though, will need to work to support their new, used
cars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Surely, some will argue that they
need a car to get to work... so that they can have money in order to maintain
their cars... so that they can get to work...etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From
there, ones adult life becomes a constant barrage of images to reinforce the
normalcy of car ownership and use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Psychological reinforcement comes heavily from our media sources.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One third of all T.V. advertisements are for
automobiles and a great deal of newspaper space, including the weekly
automotive section, is appropriated to present images, statistics, and
commentary based on cars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
prohibits a reasonable debate on our collective auto obsession, since the
medias finances are so tied in with the auto industry.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The government, too, is saturated with
lobbyists representing the interests of the auto, oil, tire, and road
construction industries, thus prohibiting major promulgation of alternative
transportation funding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Subtle
apparitions also occur in other ways, e.g. the glorification of winning a new
car as the top prize in a T.V. game show or at the New York Marathon, auto
company sponsorship of bicycle races, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>While
the media continue to glorify accidents involving airplanes, trains, subways or
buses, over 40,000 people a year - a Vietnam War total -die in car accidents.
(1)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>According to the U.S. National
Safety Council, the death rate per mile travelled in a car is 18 times greater
than in a train and 97 times greater than in a bus. (2)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This does not include pedestrians;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in New York City alone, 283 pedestrians were
killed and 15,600 were injured by motorists in 1993. (3)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Within the developing worlds chaotic mix of
motorized and non-motorized vehicles, the driver and pedestrian fatality rate
is close to 20 times greater than in the United States. (4)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Car use also adversely affects human health
by promoting a more sedentary lifestyle than, say, someone who gets around by
bicycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ethos of the car oriented suburbs,
says the social critic Lewis Mumford, creates an encapsulated life, spent more
and more either in a motor car or within the cabin of darkness before the
television set.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Urban commuters who
drive to and from work increase their levels of stress and hypertension, as
they long to escape traffic and arrive at work or at home.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Being stuck in traffic will subsequently
affect workers morale and productivity, and, along with delayed delivery of
goods, costs the American economy $100 billion a year, according to the General
Accounting Office. (5)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>THE SUBSIDIZING OF THE AMERICAN MOTORIST</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
promotion of car culture is clearly evident in the massive subsidies bestowed
upon motorists to enable them to drive almost anywhere as cheaply and
efficiently as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The true costs
of driving an automobile are obfuscated, for their disclosure would certainly
reduce auto use and make alternative means more attractive.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This would not be compatible with the
interests of the oil, car, road construction, or development industries, all of
whom contribute heavily to politicians on the local and national levels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Ample
cheap and free parking is a significant way in which motorists are
subsidized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Real estate values in urban
areas are costly, yet motorist are allowed to use up to 100 square feet of
public space for the storage of their vehicles.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>What reserves the side of the street to be used for the sole
purpose of parking cars?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Could one use
the space for storage instead?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To put a
trampoline, maybe?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Could one open up a
futon in a parking space and sleep overnight?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>What privileges car owners to eat up such valuable urban space, when
others pay hundreds of dollars for apartments hardly bigger than a parking
space?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
allotment of public space is just one of the many ways in which motorists are
heavily subsidized in our country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Charlie Komanoff, an energy consultant in New York, calculates a total
subsidy of $700 billion per year, averaging out to about $5.50 per gallon,
through the federal and state government<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He estimates that this
is roughly equivalent to what the individual motorist pays for upkeep, fuel,
insurance, taxes, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore, he
reasons, driving in the U.S. is done at half price.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The other half is provided for by the taxpayer.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This puts those who do not drive: the
elderly, poor people, or those who choose not to, at a severe financial
disadvantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>According
to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, taxes from gas, new car purchases,
and registration, cover only 2/3 of the costs of building and maintaining
highways and roads. (6)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The remaining
costs arrive via the general tax fund.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>To cover the myriad of costs associated with driving, gas would have to
be between $3-$4 per gallon. (7)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
is closer to the rate found in European countries, where gas tax is 5x<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>greater than in the U.S.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(Additionally, taxes on new car purchases
overseas are close to 50% of the cost, where here, the rate is 5-10% of the
total cost of the new car.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Considering
the uproar over President Clintons 1993 request for a 10 cent increase in gas
taxes, it is easy to see why hidden subsidies need to replace a system of
direct taxation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
primary cost of a car dependant transportation system is the construction and
maintenance of highways, roads, and bridges, to the tune of $200 million a day.
(8)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, there are many other ways
in which motorists are getting a free ride.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A significant portion of our security forces are utilized in automobile
related issues: accidents, thefts, traffic control, and parking
enforcement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These police officers
could be much better utilized going after true criminals, rather than waving
rush-hour traffic along, or investigating a minor traffic accident.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many of these accidents expound yet another
burden on the taxpayer by disabling expensive pieces of public
infrastructure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Destroyed fire
hydrants, light poles, mailboxes, street signs, guardrails, planters, etc.
become financial burdens that would be mitigated in a society less reliant on
automobiles for transportation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Besides
municipal police, State Police units are an enormous public expense, and
apprehending highway speeders seems to be their <i>raison detre</i>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Additionally, a large portion of health care
costs are related to car accidents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Oil
and car companies get large public subsidies, ranging from tax breaks to oil
exploration permits on public lands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Employers are allowed to deduct from their taxes the expense of
providing parking for their workers, and receive tax benefits for providing
company cars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are more strictly
limited when it comes to tax incentives for mass transit or bicycle use.
(9)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The environmental damage due to car
use: dirty air, dirty water, deforestation, etc., is impossible to calculate,
but certainly not insignificant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Perhaps
the most expensive endowment of all, lies within the tangled fabric of our
foreign policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every year, we spend
billions of dollars to protect our oil tankers travelling through the Persian
Gulf, as well troops for foreign countries such as Saudi Arabia.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>We even went to war to preserve our right
to drive wherever, and whenever, we saw fit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This prompted Senator Bob Dole to say: We are there for 3 letters:
O-I-L.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That is why we are in the
Gulf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We are not there to save
democracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Saudi Arabia is not a democracy,
and neither is Kuwait.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meanwhile, if
we had continued conserving oil after 1985 at the same rate as before, we would
have eliminated the need for any oil from the gulf. (10)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The industrialized worlds thirst for oil
has allowed it to become pawns in international politics by their intense
reliance on petroleum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This dependence
plays right into the hands of dictators like Saddam Hussein, who know exactly
how to provoke our enmity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Government
and corporate encouragement of car use, and suburban sprawl as a support
structure for our fallacious economic growth is nothing new.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It began in earnest in 1936 with the
creation of the National City Lines Company, a corporate front group
representing General Motors, Standard Oil, Firestone Tire, and Mack
Trucks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the next 15 years, this
powerful company bought out 45 street car and trolley systems throughout the
country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the 1950s, all 45 transit
systems were completely dismantled, opening the way for private car use and
increased bus service, a demand that GM was all too happy to supply.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was the sad fate of public
transportation in Los Angeles, a system nearly as extensive as New Yorks.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Eventually, National City Lines was found
guilty of criminal antitrust violations, but the verdict was moot, for the
great suburban build out was in full throttle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Meanwhile,
in the 1930s, Roosevelts Federal Housing Authority (FHA) was created to put
the post-depression construction industry back on its feet, and to improve the
housing stock for Americans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The FHA
subsidized banks through the federal treasury, and therefore allowed for
reduced downpayments, and extended mortgages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Unfortunately, the FHA did not guarantee new loans for those who wanted
to build or renovate in the inner cities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Maybe this should come as no surprise considering that one its
commissioners happened to be on the Board of Directors of the Standard Oil
Company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After WWII, the government
allowed the millions of returning G.I.s to own homes without any necessary
downpayment, and mortgage interests were made tax deductible.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus ownership was made less expensive than
renting, and with the planned system of new highways, white veterans flocked to
the burgeoning suburbs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As
farmland and forests were being paved over with housing developments in the
1950s, the county and state road systems were becoming overburdened.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our economy demanded more growth, and the
Federal Government began the largest public works project in our history, the
Interstate Highway System.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>President
Eisenhower began funding the highways after a hearty recommendation by his self
appointed commission, chaired by Lucius D. Clay, on the Board of Directors of
General Motors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>41,000 miles of new
expressways spread over the country like a complex of veins and arteries.
(11)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Apologists for the vast new
highway system insisted that they would quicken urban evacuation in the case of
a Soviet nuclear attack, and, that they would provide enormous expanses of
pavement and concrete to act as firebreaks, allowing sectors to remain
unscathed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Many
companies had enormous profits to make through suburban expansion.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The obvious beneficiaries were the oil and
car companies, but many others which produced appliances, lawn mowers, lawn
care products, etc. stood to cash in also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A major player was General Electric, who realized that every new home
was certain to need a new washer and dryer, refrigerator, stove, blender, and
other convenience items.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>GE knew that
their fortunes lay within the increased unpopularity of urban apartment
living.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To encourage this, they
sponsored many exhibitions and architectural competitions to glorify the modern
suburban house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Famous architects
normally won the competitions, bringing with them the legitimacy, and press
coverage, of the single family suburban home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>While
large sums of money funded the creation of highways and airports, rail

space or nature exists anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>People
are now either moving back into the city, or moving further and further into
exurbia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The pace of this exodus has
been exascerbated by advances in computers and the burgeoning information
superhighway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Advances in high
technology have rendered the proximity to the city as insignificant for some,
and has allowed them to create home offices on the fringes of the
wilderness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These pioneers are
increasing the extirpation of forests and farmland by building structures and
roads into areas where none belong.</span></p>

half a century ago, most people lived in a city or a rural location, the
post-war blossoming of our car culture has allowed the typical American to now
live in a suburban housing development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

to suburbs for the good of their children, yet their children are stuck in
virtual isolation and dependence, for their communities are designed not for
them, but instead for cars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, they

of the reason why suburbs look the way they do is because of zoning laws.<span

development and business interests, many of the codes are provided for the
convenience of automobiles as if they were the dominant life form on the
planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The main premise behind our
current zoning codes is the complete and distanced seperation of homes and
jobs, as if we still inhabited cities of smokestacked factories and revolting
slaughterhouses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With segregation
rather than mixed-use, the ability to perform daily errands or go to work
becomes impossible by walking or biking, and with poor mass transit, a motor
vehicle becomes a necessity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Additionally, it creates the dysfunctional hierarchy of the commercial
strip, the destination for so many who simply need a soda or a newspaper.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Corner stores are not allowed in most
suburban residential neighborhoods, nor are apartments allowed above shops and
restaurants, denying mixed use buildings, and keeping density at a minimum.</span></p>

laws regarding street design contribute to the lack of community in most

</span>The comforting feeling of enclosure is what makes 19th century
brownstone-lined streets so charming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

late night motorist can negociate the street at higher speeds.<span

environment designed for automobile driving, and with zero regard for the public
realm. (15)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>On
the commercial boulevards, zoning requires that buildings be set back certain

motorists comes to its utter perversion as gas stations and restaurants float
their signs hundreds of feet in the air, begging for the attention of the
speeding motorist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The suburban strip
has also created its own building and spacial typologies: the drive-in

fortress walls of noise and smog, and built below grade they resemble moats,
often with infrequent overpasses to further divide the community. From an

</span>Other large mammals also come to the roadway to innocently use it as a
travel corridor. The proximity of the large mammals attracts<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>curious and naive onlookers who frequently
harass the animals or try to feed them human food. Wild animals also come to
the road to eat de-icing salts in the winter season, increasing the potential
of a collision, but also poisoning the animal due to the sodium and calcium
chlorides present in the salt. (20)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another
way in which automobile ownership and use is detrimental to the environment is
the vast quantities of natural resources required to sustain a transportation
mode. Besides the seemingly infinite amalgam of wood, gravel, asphalt, and
steel used to build and maintain the Earths roads and highways, the worlds
400 million cars requires excessive amounts of resources and energy to create.
In a culture less reliant on automobiles, the inner city streets ubiquitous
abandoned car, the monumentalized pile of worn tires, or the junkyard cache of
flattened cars would be greatly lessened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Although

head of the GM styling division said, Our biggest job is to hasten
obsolescence. In 1934, the average car ownership span was five years; now it

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
environmental problem most apparent to the public is air pollution. Within
urban areas, cars are the single largest source of air pollution, and create
13% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions, 28% of Chlorofluorocarbons, and
between 30-40% of nitrogen oxides, the primary chemical responsible for acid
rain, according to the Marland Energy Magazine in 1983. The E.P.A. reports that
automobile air conditioners are the single largest source of ozone depleting

thought they could get away with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Their powerful lobbyists are constantly persuading the U.S. and other
governments to open up fragile wilderness and marine habitats for oil
exploration, whether it be in a tropical rainforest, a spectacular mountain

damage is done even if oil is not found in sufficient quantities to warrant
refining. Seismic studies destroy habitat and terrify wildlife, and the myriad
of abandoned roads are often subsequently used by logging companies to get to
areas that were initially off limits to them. The predicament can only get
worse, for as Asia, especially China, developes its system of roads and opens
its markets, the numbers of cars are expected to double globally by 2010.<span

of humanitys most pressing problems such as deforestation, the loss of
