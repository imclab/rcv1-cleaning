<BR>ABSTRACT: Although teachers are often told to use literature as models

for students' writing, they are rarely provided with specific suggestions

on how, when, and why to use literature, or trade books, in their curriculum.

Yet there are many situations in which the use of literature can be helpful

to the novice writer. With pre-kindergarten or kindergarten children, teachers

can help students build schema by writing books themselves. This type of

schema building continues at all levels, and is assisted by books about

books, such as "Harold and the Purple Crayon" and "Simon's Book." The technique

of "copy change," using a story as the basis for writing a similar story,

helps children develop their personal voice, and can be used at any level.

For older students who are less confident of their writing ability, books

such as "How To Write Secret Codes" and "How To Draw Cartoons" are effective

in easing their anxiety by providing "how to" practice. Other suggestions

for employing literature as a model for student writing include using trade

books to teach literary devices ("The Diary of Anne Frank" for diaries,

and "Science Experiments You Can Eat" for content area writing), and writing

book extensions (prologues or epilogues for books, new stories for well-known

characters, or changing the setting of a story). (An annotated bibliography

of trade books is appended.) (MM) GEOGRAPHIC_SOURCE: U.S.; California

<BR>ABSTRACT: Focusing on children's books identified as "notable" for

their rich use of language, this book presents essays that discuss literary

genres and literary language, responding to the language of Notable Books,

and developing an appreciation for language diversity. The book also presents

brief essays by well-known children's authors regarding their writing processes.

The notable works of children's literature discussed in the book were identified

over a 10-year period by the Notable Children's Trade Books in the Language

Arts Committee of the Children's Literature Assembly, a special interest

group of the National Council of Teachers of English. After an introductory

essay ("Wordcrafting: What Makes a Book Notable in the Language Arts?"

by Susan Lehr), chapters in the book are (1) "Picture Books: Language That

Sparks the Mind and Fuels the Imagination" (Janice V. Kristo and Linda

Leonard Lamme); (2) "Poetic Texts and Poetic Language" (Amy A. McClure);

(3) "The Language of Facts: Using Nonfiction Books to Support Language

Growth" (Sylvia M. Vardell); (4) "Notable Novels in the Classroom: Helping

Students to Increase Their Knowledge of Language and Literature" (Christine

Doyle Francis); (5) "Language Use through Drama" (Anthony L. Manna); (6)

"Language of the Storyteller" (Inga Kromann-Kelly); and (7) "Connecting

Writing, Talk, and Literature" (Yvonne Siu-Runyan); (8) "How to Do Things

with Words: Trickster Stories, Multicultural Awareness, and Language Arts"

(Jon C. Stott); (9) "Diversity in Language: Using Notable African American

Children's Literature in the Classroom" (Deborah Thompson); (10) "International

Books and the Language Arts" (Carl M. Tomlinson); and (11) "Linking Literature

and Language Use through Thematic Units" (Barbara Chatton and Susan Hepler).

The book concludes with essays written by 38 authors of Notable Books (including

Avi, Eve Bunting, Paula Fox, Patricia Lauber, Gary Paulsen, and Jerry Spinelli)

that reflect on their own processes of writing and the decisions they make

about such matters as wording, style, and the use of dialect. A bibliography

of approximately 300 Notable Books is attached. (RS)&nbsp;

teaching strategies and types of materials. This edition of the book recognizes

promising developments in elementary education, including writing as a

way of learning in all curriculum areas; the increased use of nonfiction

trade books in science and social studies; the integration of skill learning

in unit and thematic teaching of topics; and the inclusion of special-needs

students in the regular classroom. Chapters in the book are: (1) Language

and the Language Arts; (2) Teaching the Language Arts; (3) Language Learning

and the Young Child; (4) Beginning Language Arts Programs; (5) Using Oral

Language; (6) Listening, Thinking, and Learning; (7) Grammar and Language

guide are grouped into primary (K-2), intermediate (grades 3-5), and advanced

(grades 6-8). Culled from lists compiled from 1994 to 1996, the trade books

listed here offer many opportunities for reading aloud, discussion, and

the stimulation of writing across the curriculum areas of language arts,

social studies, math, art, drama, and music. The books included in the

guide were chosen because teachers believe they reflect high literary quality

in style, content, structure, beauty of language, and presentation. (RS)

<BR>ABSTRACT: Based on the premise that viewing the curriculum holistically

enriches the instructional practices of teachers and adds depth and meaning

to children's school experiences, this guide is intended to: (1) encourage

teachers who have doubts about using literature in their content area classes;

(2) support those presently using literature to teach; and (3) share some

of the joy that can be found in children's books. The guide offers practical

suggestions for class activities and techniques to help classroom teachers

blend the subject areas across the lines of time and disciplines--rather

than treating each subject as an isolated cell, natural connections can

be made among science, social studies, mathematics, art, and music. The

guide stresses that it is language arts, however, that forms the catalyst

binding all the content areas. After an introduction, chapters in the guide

are: Literature in the Curriculum; Benefits of Literature for Teachers

and Children; Enriching Textbooks through Literature; Using Literature

Thematically; Writing and Literature in Content Areas; and Getting Started

with Literature. Contains eferences.

a rainy day bulletin board, and reading folders. The handbook then presents

a section of unit activities focusing on language arts, including pocket

chart rhyme card patterns, story questions, stick puppet patterns and activity

ideas, context clues, and a reading wheel. The next section contains unit

activities that focus on related curriculum, including math code, weather

makes a difference, house rules, painting Seuss-style, and kites. Finally,

the handbook offers a culminating activity, a Seuss-Award, and a bibliography.

*Trade Books; Wisconsin

<BR>ABSTRACT: Since 1987, the school district of West Allis-West Milwaukee

(Wisconsin) has reviewed and revised its elementary reading program based

on the philosophy that spoken, read, and written language must flow naturally

from the child, be used in meaningful ways to communicate real needs, and

involve tradebooks. Numerous inservice presentations and meetings generated

a rich flow of dialogue that has eased much of the discomfort which attends

any major educational change. The basal reader has become but one component

of a varied literature program. Increasingly, reading instruction has moved

towards "whole-class" instruction. Trade books were chosen by a committee

(with input from many staff members) and gradually introduced into the

curriculum. Distribution and financial constraints remain the greatest

challenges to the success of the tradebook program. Mandated district testing

needs to become more consistent with the principles of whole language,

literature-based instruction if it is to reflect appropriately the reading/language

arts growth of the students in the district. (A list of the tradebooks

used in the district and the tradebook evaluation guide are attached.)

<BR>ABSTRACT: Although teachers are often told to use literature as models

for students' writing, they are rarely provided with specific suggestions

on how, when, and why to use literature, or trade books, in their curriculum.

Yet there are many situations in which the use of literature can be helpful

to the novice writer. With pre-kindergarten or kindergarten children, teachers

can help students build schema by writing books themselves. This type of

schema building continues at all levels, and is assisted by books about

books, such as "Harold and the Purple Crayon" and "Simon's Book." The technique

of "copy change," using a story as the basis for writing a similar story,

helps children develop their personal voice, and can be used at any level.

For older students who are less confident of their writing ability, books

such as "How To Write Secret Codes" and "How To Draw Cartoons" are effective

in easing their anxiety by providing "how to" practice. Other suggestions

for employing literature as a model for student writing include using trade

books to teach literary devices ("The Diary of Anne Frank" for diaries,

and "Science Experiments You Can Eat" for content area writing), and writing

book extensions (prologues or epilogues for books, new stories for well-known

characters, or changing the setting of a story). (An annotated bibliography

of trade books is appended.) (MM)

<BR>ABSTRACT: A study identified a list of trade books that educators selected

for use in their own classrooms and a list of factors that they considered

to be the most important when selecting those books. Subjects, 486 educators

who taught in grades 4, 5, or 6 in 45 public school districts and 15 private

schools in southeastern Pennsylvania, identified two trade books they had

selected and rated 26 factors as to their importance with respect to choosing

trade books for classroom instruction. Results indicated that: (1) educators

considered factors relating to the content of the book to be more important

than the physical features; (2) they were aware that the subject matter

should be of interest to the reader and at a level appropriate to the students'

reading level and age; (3) they felt that their own review and reading

of and materials used by their students was important; (4) students' age

was rated as more important than their sex; (5) authors' names were rated

as being of little importance; and (6) 88 books were chosen by more than

three educators, and 208 were chosen by one or two respondents. Findings

suggest that a wide variety of trade books are being chosen for teaching

reading and that educators take the time to review and select books which

will be appropriate for their classes. (Contains 10 references and two

tables of data.) (RS)

<BR>ABSTRACT: A literature based reading program was developed to improve

class. Instead of using a basal reader for instruction, the students were

exposed to trade or literature books, The reading strategies that were

pre- and posttested were recognition of a sight vocabulary, recognition

of the letters of the alphabet, and recognition of family rhyming words.

The results indicated a marked improvement in reading comprehension as

well as increased student self-esteem from success in reading. (Nineteen

references and 18 appendixes containing testing instruments and results

as well as a suggested list of appropriate trade books are attached.) (Author/KEH)

<BR>ABSTRACT: A practicum was designed to improve the oral/aural vocabulary

which would eventually improve the reading vocabulary of second language

learners. The practicum, implemented in a second grade by a media specialist

who counted on the cooperation of the classroom teacher, consisted of a

read-aloud program in which the students read daily from a variety of trade

books. Subjects were 26 students who had already completed an English-as-a-Second

Language program and were considered to be at an independent level in English.

Pre- and posttests were administered which recommended reading and listening

levels for a frustration, instructional, and independent level of instruction,

as well as a writing vocabulary test. Flyers were developed for community

speakers and school wide programs; and for recommended read-aloud lists

for recently published titles for various age levels. Faculty members were

encouraged to read aloud to their respective classes. "Buddy" readers were

trained to read and listen to the participating second-grade class--each

second grader had his/her own buddy. Other teachers also changed their

attitudes on the importance of reading aloud. Data analysis revealed that

students' oral/aural vocabulary and reading vocabulary increased, and the

school principal has instituted a regular read-aloud portion to the existing

reading program. (Contains 46 references. Appendixes include a read-aloud

packet listing various genres and age-appropriate books, and a parent night

notice in English and Spanish.) (NKA)
