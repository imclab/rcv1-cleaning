I figured, as I have sold my litle house, that If in need one can allways live in this thing even though it stops running. Besides I will be on the road for two years ++ so better have some space to work in and some solar to charge all them batteries. for digital this and that :-)<br />
<p><br />
You should be able to finde some nice camper. Take a look at the  Merchedes to. Or even an Iveco. <br />

While Germany might be a good place to buy a car, I think it will be hard to get a registration there. First of all you need to have an &#8216;oficial&#8217; adress in Germany and just that means that you have to spend long hours with German bureaucrats. The best thing would be if you know someone in Germany who can register the car under his name. Also consider that you have to pay taxes. They can be quite high especially for older cars. Some vans do have a truck registration, which makes it a lot cheaper. It might be easier somewhere else&#8230;.

I&#8217;ve purchased a car in Eastern Europe, and would highly recommend to <span class="caps">NOT</span> buy one there, but would definitely recommend to sell it in eastern Europe &#8211; although, what do you mean by &#8220;Eastern Europe?&#8221; How far east are we talking, as Poland is quite a lot different from Russia or Ukraine or Romania or Slovakia. Some eastern countries are in the EU, some not, and this makes for interesting rules. I would be careful about Ukraine &#8211; they have one of the highest import duty taxes on cars for the carnet de passage, I think it&#8217;s around %30 of the value of the car. This makes cars in Ukraine <span class="caps">VERY</span> expensive for basically nothing &#8211; on the flip side, you can make some money on the deal. I bought a car &#8211; 1989 Lada Samara &#8211; for $3000 and flipped it for $4000 a few months later. That being said, I don&#8217;t know too many Ukrainians who&#8217;d want a VW camper. Anyway, those are some things to consider.</p>
<p>I rode my motorcylce across Africa in 1998, and the killer thing was the carnet de passage, which is basically insurance for the vehicle and that you won&#8217;t sell it at your final destination. Each country has a different % of the value of the vehicle for an import fee, some are really low, others astronically high. When you pay for it, they take the highest % country and work from there. I valued my bike at $2500, then the highest country I think was about %15, so I had to pre-pay beforehand &#8211; when I proved that I didn&#8217;t sell my bike, I got my money back. I don&#8217;t know if this is pertinent to your situation, but maybe something of importance. Also, for pure research, check out Ewan MacGregor nd Charlie Boorman&#8217;s (yes, the actors) book on them driving around the world on motorbikes. They actually have a pretty detailed section about all the bureaucracy of travelling through eastern Europe and what it took to get through.</p>
<p>Good luck!

display_translation_box(5251,'I\'ve purchased a car in Eastern Europe, and would highly recommend to NOT buy one there, but would definitely recommend to sell it in eastern Europe - although, what do you mean by \"Eastern Europe?\" How far east are we talking, as Poland is quite a lot different from Russia or Ukraine or Romania or Slovakia. Some eastern countries are in the EU, some not, and this makes for interesting rules. I would be careful about Ukraine - they have one of the highest import duty taxes on cars for the carnet de passage, I think it\'s around %30 of the value of the car. This makes cars in Ukraine VERY expensive for basically nothing - on the flip side, you can make some money on the deal. I bought a car - 1989 Lada Samara - for $3000 and flipped it for $4000 a few months later. That being said, I don\'t know too many Ukrainians who\'d want a VW camper. Anyway, those are some things to consider.\n\nI rode my motorcylce across Africa in 1998, and the killer thing was the carnet de passage, which is basically insurance for the vehicle and that you won\'t sell it at your final destination.

Hi all, I&#8217;m reviving a post of mine from two months ago. I want to buy a car in Europe to drive around Eastern Europe this summer and I am wondering if I should buy in a Western European country such as Germany or in Hungary or Romania&#8212;I will mostly be in Romania?! Apparently, I need a Green Card (insurance), but not a carnet de passage. But what about the previous owner&#8217;s documents, an emissions sticker and registration since I don&#8217;t have an address in Eastern Europe or Germany? Am I forgetting anything? How hard is all this to do? I&#8217;ve checked out some of the sites that sell cars, and I basically want to be able to show up and buy a car and get everything taken care of in a few days at most. . . Davin.

<strong>Get your Car Registered in Germany</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get an Official German Address.</strong></p>
<p>For this you have to register in any German town, best would be where you buy and register the car. In order to get this you need a to fill out a form in the &#8220;Einwohnermeldeamt&#8221; (registration office). In some states you have to have a signature of your landlord on this form to get registered, in others you can show it later (noone will ever ask for it). <strong>Remember: German clerks speak very bad English, that is  if they speak.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Buy your Car of Choice</strong></p>
<p>Make sure it has <span class="caps">ASU</span> and <span class="caps">TUV</span> for two years. These are tests the car has to pass every two years (fromer for exhaust fume, latter for security). <strong>Remember: No registration without <span class="caps">ASU</span> and <span class="caps">TUV</span>!</strong> From the previous owner you&#8217;ll get the &#8220;Fahrzeugbrief&#8221; which proves that he is the owner of the car. <strong>Remember: The &#8220;Fahrzeugbrief&#8221; and <span class="caps">NOT</span> the &#8220;Fahrzeugschein&#8221; is the prove of ownership.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Insurance</strong></p>
<p>You need at least indemnity insurance. Actually I have no clue where you get that. I guess at an insurance company, but I think the car dealer of your choice will help you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Get your Car Registered</strong></p> 
<p>With all these papers you have to go to the &#8220;Strassenverkehrsamt&#8221;. If you have all the correct forms (Fahrzeugbrief, insurance papers, <span class="caps">ASU</span>, <span class="caps">TUV</span>, address), it is easy from here. You just go there, show them the forms, fill out some more forms, pay, get a license number, go to the license plate maker, buy a license plate, go back, get four little stickers, pu them in the right place on the plates, attach the plates to your car and off you are to Eastern Europe. <strong>But remember: German clerks speak very bad English, that is  if they speak.</strong></p>  
<p><strong>Step 4: Pay Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Self explanatory.

Dunno if it&#8217;s still happening but Market Road in North London (nearest tube Caledonian Rd) is where people selling camper-vans used to go to sell &#8216;em. Either saturday or sunday&#8230;just turn up with some discreetly hidden cash and you could get yourself a bargain &#8211; at least you&#8217;ll be able to take a look at the goods properly before buying.</p>
<p>As I say, I dont know if it still happens but it used to be a regular occurance.

davin, read my post above carefully. this is the way to do it, &#8220;unofficially,&#8221; as opposed to Mr. Daniel Etter&#8217;s excellent instructions on how to do it &#8220;officially.&#8221; both methods will work. his is safer and obviously proper. mine was clearly &#8220;cutting corners,&#8221; to say the least, although it was absolutely legal. Laws regarding all this may have tightened up a bit since i did it, but there are always ways to do things cheaply when necessary. <br />
.<br />
also, since you live in the UK, why don&#8217;t you just drive your British car across Europe? the right &#8211; hand drive is annoying but you&#8217;ll get used to driving it in Europe easily enough. in bosnia i inherited kit roane&#8217;s british toyota pick-up truck with right hand drive, even took it to italy. no problem.

Hi Davin<br />
Try Montenegro. On the weekend the road from Podgorica to Cetinje is lined with second hand car dealers, apparently these days they are all legit, and you can pick up a good car for a few thousand euros. You can register on the dealers name and get a letter of authorisation, the Green card should be pretty cheap there, maybe around $400. That should only take a couple of days to sort out, and then you&#8217;re good to go. Also Montenegrin plates are pretty handy, especially in the Balkans, because no one hates them enough to smash your car up&#8230;except, that is, the Croats. You shouldn&#8217;t take a car with Serbian or Montenegrin plates anywhere on the Croatian coast if you want it to last more than a day.

That should only take a couple of days to sort out, and then you\'re good to go. Also Montenegrin plates are pretty handy, especially in the Balkans, because no one hates them enough to smash your car up...except, that is, the Croats. You shouldn\'t take a car with Serbian or Montenegrin plates anywhere on the Croatian coast if you want it to last more than a day.');

Davin, <br />
I unterstand what you want to do, but: I&#8217;m pretty sure, that as foreigner you will get ripped off if buying a car in Germany or where ever. You need definately somebody to make this deal for you, in the language of the country you&#8217;re going to buy in. Especially insurance  will be expensive as hell for you. You start as a beginner, for the insurance at least. This means 200% up on your rate, in Germany for sure.</p>
<p>Find somebody you trust and who trusts you, and let him buy a cheap car and register it on his name, same thing with the insurance.</p>
<p>I have been to Romania and driving around there, ain&#8217;t no fun, I mean it can be dangerous, especially after dark. One night on the way to the Hotel I almost hit a car, parked in the middle of the road without any lights on or nearby. Hell, I mean there was a house close by , but you didn&#8217;t see the car at all, it was pitchblack around there. Next day on the way to an interview, I had to go the same road back and the car was still there. But it was only crap metal anymore, it got hit by another car and both cars were sitting there in the middle of the road, totally devastated. I still hope nobody got seriously injured.</p>
<p>Maybe the Andrew&#8217;s idea is the way to go. Buy on the balkans and after you&#8217;re finished you got anice present for some friend in Romania&#8230;</p>
<p>Regards Heinrich

i like andrews idea of buying a car in montenegro.at the end of your trip you could try and sell it on in serbia,as second hand cars here are expensive.the more money you can spend the better,because goood cars are relatively cheaper than 20 year old clapped-out clunkers.plus,repair bills could be expensive if the mechanic knows you are a stranger.i wouldnt recommend a camper van,as they tend to classify them as buses on the motorway toll roads,can get very expensive in tolls.try buying your green card in montenegro or serbia,a green card for a serbian car is about 12 quid for 6 months!a bargain i would say.<br />
sounds like you are going to be spending a lot of time on dodgy eastern european roads,get a lada niva,4&#215;4.you can even find them now with renault(i think) diesel motors.built like tanks,so useful when you encounter a rakia sodden local driving with no lights at night on a mountain road.the roads of the balkans are not festooned with roadside shrines for no reason.

why would you get ripped off buying a car, heinrich? cars are cars, if you are an experienced driver (and tinkerer) you know what to look for &#8212; rust, condition of wires, brakes, exhaust system, condition of transmission, etc. <del>- and that&#8217;s the same whether you speak the language or not. Also, prices are prices. cars are worth a certain amount, plus or minus local rate, and that&#8217;s that. you should pretty much know what particular cars are worth before you go shopping. i wouldn&#8217;t spend more than $2000 for an (old) car, or up to $4000 in countries where they&#8217;re particularly expensive, and pretty much that&#8217;s it. frankly you do well spending under $1000, and tinkering it into shape for a couple hundred dollars more.<br />
.<br />
and your comments about driving in romania being &#8220;no fun,&#8221; well, that&#8217;s exactly the reverse, isn&#8217;t it? depends on your point of view! there&#8217;s nothing more fun than cruising along at 120 kph, and crashing into a huge hole in the road! may do a bit of damage to your car (and you!) -</del>- but hey, that&#8217;s why you wanted to wander around the balkans &#8212; right?!? don&#8217;t feel too bad about it, i&#8217;m sure, as michael points out, that they&#8217;ll put up a roadside shrine for you. <br />
.<br />
Finally, the comments about insurance are to the point. it is <span class="caps">MUCH</span> cheaper to get your green card in the east, rather than in a proper country like Germany. and that cheaper green card IS valid everywhere, just like its more expensive western version. Of course, if you actually get into an accident&#8230;..(!)<br />
.<br />
Also, when you&#8217;re back in Western Europe with an Eastern registered car, you never have to pay parking tickets. I had my old Bulgarian registered VW in Paris for a year, the poor ticket writers couldn&#8217;t even identify the country-of-registration, they put a question mark on the tickets! i never paid a single one! sure beats new york city!

one final thought, we should dedicate this thread to harold doornbos, radio reporter from Holland, who in the 8 years or so of the yugoslav wars of secession, went through 22 or 24 cars. literally. seriously.<br />
.<br />
these included an armored mercedes once used by german businessmen, stolen in front of the hotel moskva in belgrade, a VW Golf that he left in front of his flat in budapest for, over a year, it slowly disintegrated one piece at a time, a citroen BX that i inherited after my Jetta was stolen, and was eventually impounded by the French, and dozens more&#8230;<br />

he holds the record for most cars consumed by a war correspondent!

yes, people either love or hate Nivas. i happen to love them. i think harold had one or two at various times. gas guzzlers, but that 4-wheel drive on a relatively light chasis take you through snow that a land rover or land cruiser can&#8217;t handle. i borrowed one to tool around mostar and its environs back in &#8216;96 for an assignment, it was great. polish license plates on that one. of course the gear-shift knob popped off as i took a tight corner, and even on a proper highway the fastest it would go was around 110 or 115, but that&#8217;s OK. a definite plus during mud season. not the best car for long-haul trans-continental voyages, due to slow speed and high gas consumption. but perfect for balkan local work.<br />
.<br />
sadly the era of communist cars is ending. they&#8217;re all getting so old and most countries won&#8217;t even let you register and drive them any more because of emissions standards. but just think for a moment&#8230;there was a time when a poor east german worker would wait three or four years for a Trabant&#8230;this brave new europe may be more peaceful, efficient, and comfortable, but it&#8217;s dominated by the golden arches of McDonald&#8217;s rather than the hammers and sickles of proletarian unity.

Hey Alan, <br />
getting ripped off happens, even if you speak the language. What are you talking about are the real obvious things to look after, buying a cheap car. If you spend more and think, â€œnow the rest of my trip I don&#8217;t have to worryâ€œ you should buy rather new ( ha ha ha). <br />
Just an example: A lot of used cars sold in Berlin are total trash, wrecks which had be redone in Poland for small money. The only problem, a car redone to look perfect will not withstand the same impact as the car was designed for. A lot of airbags won&#8217;t work. These cars are totally insecure. But you really have to look hard to find traces of the former accident. They guys doing this are geniouses.</p>
<p>Anyway: Sure is driving in Romania fun, actually a hell of fun, as long as you return in perfect shape and healthy&#8230;</p>
<p>And the ticket thing is so cool. I drive a car with German licence plates in Spain and it even works here. God bless the European Community.

heinrich, airbags?!?!!! <br />
.<br />
we are talking apples and oranges!!! the old cars that i&#8217;ve driven (and, yes, been stuck with, broken down&#8230;) were all too old to have airbags. you are totally right regarding that level of car&#8230;cars being made to look better than they actually are&#8230;<br />
.<br />
i am talking really of cars old enough (10-15 years old, or older) where no one would take the trouble to defraud you, because you are paying a really cheap price. no one is going to try and cheat you on a $800 1985 Opel, for example. it&#8217;s just too old to be worth cheating you over. And you know what you&#8217;re getting. You know that it&#8217;s going to need work, and regular love and care&#8230;and you know that one $800 car can be better than another&#8230;if you choose it correctly.<br />
.<br />
old cars are a bit like old cameras. they are more demanding, require a bit more skill. no automatic transmission, usually. no power steering or power windows or anti-lock brakes, no power adjustable seats, no CD player in the radio, no fuel injection, probably, and definitely no airbags. are you better off with a new car, a 2006 <span class="caps">SAAB</span>, for instance? of course you are, if you have the money. but if you just want to get by with something old, cheap, relatively reliable, then i do think it makes sense to get a 1988 VW Golf, or Jetta, for example. Plenty of them were used and not so abused in Western Europe, and they&#8217;re simple enough cars that mechanics all across Europe can work on them, and those VW engines were made very well indeed. lots of power with decent fuel economy. and the VW suspension is great <del>- really built for speed and cornering</del>- in a consumer-level car.<br />
.<br />
and yes, of course, drive carefully and get home safe! there&#8217;s no alternative for good road skills, developing good instincts. much better to photograph those roadside shrines rather than having one built for you!

Plenty of them were used and not so abused in Western Europe, and they\'re simple enough cars that mechanics all across Europe can work on them, and those VW engines were made very well indeed. lots of power with decent fuel economy. and the VW suspension is great -- really built for speed and cornering-- in a consumer-level car.\n.\nand yes, of course, drive carefully and get home safe! there\'s no alternative for good road skills, developing good instincts. much better to photograph those roadside shrines rather than having one built for you!');

Alan, <br />
I have been driving an ( by now) 17 year old <span class="caps">BMW</span> 316i with an airbag. I bought it for 2000 German Mark/ 1000 â‚¬ and it served me well. Now I drive an 6 year old Opel Kombi/ Stationwagon ( with Airbags)  and this is a really shitty car. It was more expensive then every car I ever bought, but I had no choice. I have to haul around two kids and their friends as well. And even on this expensive car they cheated on me.</p>
<p>The VW is maybe a good choice, but there won&#8217;t be really cheap either. Too many people look for this kind of bargain. Anyway. Davin will find a car, drive it and maybe we will even see a picture of this &#8220;godness of the dark roads&#8221;.</p>
<p>Regards

I just got done doing Peugeot&#8217;s Buy-Back program.  On paper, you&#8217;re buying a car and selling it before you leave but they&#8217;ve made it almost as trouble free as renting a car, but a bit cheaper.  Minimum rental period is 17 days.  You get a  brand new car and all insurance is included which makes it completely worthwhile <span class="caps">IMO</span>.  You can drive most anywhwere in Europe.  Go to AutoEurope&#8217;s website if you are interested.
