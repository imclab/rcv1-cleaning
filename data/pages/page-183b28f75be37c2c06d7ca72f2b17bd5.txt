        What is An Auto Broker?</h1>
      <p>Most consumers are accustomed to the idea of engaging professional assistance 
        when it comes to important purchases. For instance, realtors and stock 
        brokers are routinely used to assist with the purchase of real estate 
        or investments. These are things that a consumer could technically arrange 
        on their own, yet many find that it is easier and/or smarter to solicit 
        professional assistance. </p>
      <p>Despite the fact that a car purchase is one of the major life investments 
        consumers make in their lifetime, the concept of using an auto broker 
        to help arrange the sale of an automobile has not yet become widely embraced 
        by the general public - in fact, many people do not even know that using 
        an auto broker is an available option when it comes to making a car purchase. 
        Below we will attempt to outline some of the key benefits that auto brokerage 
        services hold for car buying consumers.</p>
      <h3>What an Auto Broker Does</h3>
      <p> Quite simply, an auto broker manages the process of buying a car on 
        behalf of a customer. This includes finding the desired vehicle, negotiating 
        the price, delivering the final paperwork, and securing financing, if 
        necessary. An auto brokers job is to help the customer save time and money 
        in the car buying process.</p>
      <h3>Why Use An Auto Broker?</h3>
      <p>Auto brokers offer several advantages for consumers. The following are 
        a few of the key benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Convenience - Saving Time</b><br>
          <font color="#000000">Using an auto broker saves consumers the time 
          and effort of having to car-hunt at dealer lots, an activity which most 
          people find to be less than desirable. Because auto brokers are essentially 
          professional car buyers, the entire sale process is typically seamless 
          and straightforward.</font><br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Negotiations - Saving Money</b><br>
          <font color="#000000">Because auto brokers have professional relationships 
          with networks of car dealers, they are able to secure discounted pricing 
          that they can then pass along as savings to their clients. Even when 
          the auto broker's fee is factored in to the total cost of the car, the 
          consumer still usually ends up saving money on their purchase.</font><br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Preferential Treatment - Getting What You Want</b><br>
          <font color="#000000">Auto brokers ensure that their clients receive 
          great treatment by car dealers, and are often able to enjoy perks that 
          are not available to members of the general public. For instance, if 
          there is a waiting list for a high-demand vehicle an auto broker's customer 
          may get bumped up toward the top of the list.</font><br>
          <b><br>
          </b></li>
        <li><b>Peace of Mind - Buying with Confidence</b><br>
          <font color="#000000">Consumers who use auto brokers enjoy the confidence 
          of knowing that they have a professional advocate on their side in the 
          car buying process, so they don't have to worry about the possibility 
          of fraud, deception or other consumer woes that are all to common on 
          the auto industry,</font></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Who Can Use an Auto Broker?</h3>
      <p>Any consumer who wants to buy a car can use an auto broker. In the past, 
        auto brokers have had a reputation for serving the higher end of the car 
        market (e.g. luxury cars), but most brokers today will work with just 
        about anyone seeking to purchase a new car, or a late model used vehicle.</p>
      <h3><br>
        What Does an Auto Broker Charge?</h3>
      <p>Auto broker fees are typically determined either as a flat rate or as 
        a percentage of the value of the car being purchased - some brokers will 
        take their fee as percentage of the savings they negotiate for you. Whatever 
        the pricing model, auto broker fees typically range between $400-$800 
        dollars (higher for certain luxury vehicles). Most auto brokers get their 
        fee directly from clients, although some get paid by the dealership.</p>
      <p>Even when the auto broker's fee is factored into the total expense of 
        the car, the end cost to the consumer is usually less than or equal to 
        the deal they would have got on their own - so minimally, the consumer 
        gets the service of the broker for no extra cost, and in many cases, saves 
        money on top of having the convenience that the broker service provides.</p>
      <h3><br>
        In Conclusion&#133;</h3>
      <p>We hope this overview has been helpful in highlighting what auto brokers 
        do, how they do it, and what the benefits are for consumers. If you would
