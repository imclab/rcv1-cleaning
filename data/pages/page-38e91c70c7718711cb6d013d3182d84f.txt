            <br /> <hr> <p class="section"><a name="1"><strong>Introduction</strong></a></p>
            <p> Most consumers want to know how to buy the car of their choice 
              at the best possible price. 
            <P> Many people feel that car payments are an unavoidable fact of 
              life, and that they might as well buy a newer car than an older 
              one. However, there are some advantages as well as some pitfalls 
              to be avoided when shopping for a used car. 
            <P> With improvements in the quality of automobiles over the years, 
              a well-maintained car should remain reliable for at least 10 years 
              and 100,000 miles. The U.S. Department of Transportation reports 
              the average life span of a vehicle is 12 years or 128,500 miles. 
              Surveys have shown that, on the average, a person trades in or sells 
              a car when it is only 4 1/2 years old with just 41,000 miles on 
              it. 
            <P> That leaves a lot of good cars out there with plenty of life left 
              in them. If you are looking for a new model, buying a used car of 
              the same style, only a couple of years old, can really be a good 
              deal. The biggest percentage (approximately 20 percent) of a new 
              car's value is lost in the first year of ownership. Accessories 
              such as expensive stereo systems, power assists and convenience 
              options are far less a factor in resale pricing. 
            <P> In addition, by the time a vehicle is a couple of years old, even 
              minor problems should have been discovered and corrected. 
            <div align="right"><a href="#faqusedcar">Back</a></div>
            <P class="section"> <a name="2"><strong>Pricing a Used Car</strong></a></P>
            <p> With the average price of a new car increasing every year, it 
              is not surprising that the fastest growing segment of the auto industry 
              is the used car market. In the past decade, used cars have become 
              increasingly better values. Buying a car that is just a year or 
              two old can save thousands of dollars over the price of a new model, 
              especially as the price of new cars keeps increasing. 
            <P> Decide on the year, make, model and options you desire on the 
              vehicle. Do you need a family vehicle or an economical model for 
              a college student? Also, decide what accessories you need or would 
              like to have. Once you have decided on a specific model, it is a 
              good idea to have a second or third choice in mind. 
            <P> <I>Consumers Reports </I>publishes excellent information on both 
              new and used cars, to include maintenance and repair information. 
              Narrow your choices of vehicles as much as possible. Pay attention 
              to: 
            <UL>
              <LI>visibility, 
              <LI>safety features, 
              <LI>comfort, 
              <LI>ride and 
              <LI>other items of importance. 
            </UL>
            <P> To check the &quot;recall record&quot; of a vehicle, call the 
              U.S. Department of Transportation Auto Safety Hotline at (800) 424-9393. 
              They will tell you if a car model has ever been recalled and send 
              you information concerning that recall. 
            <P> In addition, via the internet, you can obtain recall or technical 
              service bulletins on vehicles at <b><a href="http://www.alldatadiy.com/">http://www.alldatadiy.com</a>.</b>

            <P class="section"> <a name="3"><strong>Price Guides</strong></a></P>
            <p> A variety of price guides are used by lenders, dealers and individuals 
              to determine the value of used cars. Check the <I>N.A.D.A. (National 
              Automotive Dealers Association) Official Used Car Guide, Southeastern 
              Edition, </I>for the book value on your trade-in. 
            <P> This book also can be found in public libraries, local banks and 
              credit unions. It is published monthly by the NADA and provides 
              average trade-in, wholesale, loan and retail prices for nearly every 
              car sold in the last 7 years. 
            <P> Such books are not meant to provide a definitive price but to 
              serve as a reference point for negotiating with the seller. This 
              information can be obtained through the reference section of your 
              public library at no cost or there are services that provide invoice 
              prices for a fee. 
            <P> Check the classified ads in the local newspaper to determine what 
              advertisers in your area are asking for the type of car you want. 
              The difference between wholesale and retail value will be your bargaining 
              range. 
            <div align="right"><a href="#faqusedcar">Back</a></div>
            <P class="section"> <a name="4"><strong>Financing/Insurance</strong></a></P>
            <p> Check with local banks and credit unions for financing in order 
              to make comparisons with dealer financing. Be sure to determine 
              the amount that the bank or credit union will finance for a specific 
              model. Also consider obtaining preapproved credit, which would eliminate 
              dealer pressure on the purchase of a vehicle. 
            <P> Check with your insurance company for a quote on the vehicle you 
              want to purchase. Can you afford to pay insurance and car payments? 
              Also be sure to allow a little &quot;extra&quot; in your budget 
              for unexpected repairs. 
            <P> Check your local Better Business Bureau, Consumer Affairs Office, 
              and the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (1-800-435-7352) 
              for information on local automobile dealerships. 
            <P> Make sure the dealers are licensed by the Division of Motorist Services. 
              Ask to what professional associations they belong (Florida Independent 
              Automobile Dealers Association, Chamber of Commerce, etc.). How 
              long has the dealership been in business? 
            <div align="right"><a href="#faqusedcar">Back</a></div>
            <P class="section"> <a name="5"><strong>Where to Buy</strong></a></P>
            <p> A used vehicle is a major purchase and requires comparison shopping 
              for price and value to find the best deal. There are many sources 
              available to today's purchaser: 
            <UL>
              <LI>new car dealers,</LI>
              <LI>used car dealers,</LI>
              <LI>rental car companies,</LI>
              <LI>leasing companies, and</LI>
              <LI>private individuals.</LI>
            </UL>
            <P> New car dealers generally keep only the best cars and usually 
              give them a thorough inspection. In addition, consider buying from 
              a dealer who handles the particular brand of vehicle that you are 
              interested in. Look for a full service department and a well stocked 
              supply of parts. They may offer a parts and labor warranty. Be sure 
              to visit several automobile dealerships. 
            <P> Rental returns (also referred to as program cars) are often an 
              excellent value. These vehicles are typically less than two years 
              old, well equipped and maintained, with good warranties. Some &quot;unexpected 
              places&quot; to look would be domestic dealers for used imports 
              or luxury dealers for mid-priced sedans. Find a friendly salesperson 
              that you are comfortable with and ask questions to determine the 
              person's knowledge about cars. 
            <P> Private individuals are another source to be considered when purchasing 
              a used vehicle. However, a private party may not necessarily offer 
              a better deal. Buyers may end up overpaying for a car because they 
              somehow assume they are getting a better deal from a private party. 
            <P> One benefit is that the potential buyer can meet the seller face 
              to face and inquire about any mechanical problems, who was the principal 
              driver, why the vehicle is being sold and request maintenance records. 
            <P> When purchasing a vehicle from a private individual, there are 
              no warranties of any kind. It is strictly &quot;buyer beware&quot;. 
              In addition, the buyers will have to provide their own financing 
              for the vehicle or pay cash. 
            <div align="right"><a href="#faqusedcar">Back</a></div>
            <P class="section"> <a name="6"><strong>Outside of Car</strong></a></P>
            <p> Look at the vehicle during the daytime as darkness may hide problems. 
              Do not look at vehicles in the rain, which hides nicks and scratches, 
              as well as making thin, worn paint look slick. Be sure to concentrate 
              on big defects and not minor repairs that can be made easily and 
              inexpensively. 
            <P> Prepare a checklist for both the interior and exterior of the 
              vehicle, as well as those items to test while driving. Take a general 
              look around the outside of the car. A very common practice is to 
              have the car detailed to increase its appeal. Usually this includes 
              a thorough cleaning inside and out, waxing and the repair of minor 
              cosmetic items which can hide abuse or &quot;wear and tear&quot;. 
            <P> Examine both sides of the car from a distance (both front and 
              back). Look for ripples, waves, poorly fitted panels and mismatched 
              colors, all of which may indicate that body work may have been done. 
              Look for dents or rust around the bottom of the doors and fenders. 
              Bubbles along molding or chrome indicates rust underneath. Also 
              look under the vehicle for rust as well. If the rust has gone through 
              the metal, you could be looking at major repairs. 
            <P> Check for welding spots on the frame which may indicate a serious 
              accident or repairs. Open and close the doors, hood, trunk or hatchback. 
              Be sure they fit and are easy to close without slamming, sagging 
              or sticking. 
            <P> Conditions noted previously may indicate that the car was wrecked, 
              poorly kept, or has been driven excessive miles. Stand back approximately 
              10 to 15 feet from the car and see if the car is level. If one corner 
              seems lower than the others, it suggests a broken spring or other 
              chassis or suspension problem. 
            <P> Check the shocks by pushing down on each corner of the car and 
              letting go. Your car should bounce upward only once and then settle 
              back to its original position. If the car bounces several times, 
              new shocks may be needed. 
            <P> Check the tires. They should be in good shape without sidewall 
              cracks. Uneven tire wear may indicate improper wheel alignment, 
              tired shocks or worn front end components. In addition, check the 
              inside of the tires for brake fluid leakage (indicating leaking 
              wheel cylinders). 
            <P> Look under the car for oil spots, or leaks from the transmission, 
              power steering or shock absorbers. Open the hood and check belts 
              and hoses for cracks or wear. Remove the radiator cap. The coolant 
              should be a clean, greenish (or blue or yellow, depending on brand 
              of coolant used) color. Brown sludge inside the radiator neck may 
              indicate poor maintenance. 
            <P> Pull out the oil dipstick. If the oil is gummy or grayish, the 
              engine might have serious problems. If there is a black buildup 
              near the top of the dipstick, smell it. A burnt smell indicates 
              that the engine or transmission has been run hot. The automatic 
              transmission fluid should be clear and reddish in color, not brown 
              or black. A burnt smell or low fluid level indicates neglect. 
            <P> Be sure and check the fluid level in the master cylinder as well. 
              If the fluid level is low, check for leaks and have brake pads checked. 
              Look inside the trunk. Make sure there is an inflated spare tire, 
              a jack and a lug wrench. 
            <div align="right"><a href="#faqusedcar">Back</a></div>
            <P class="section"> <a name="7"><strong>Inside of Car</strong></a></P>
            <p> The interior can give you a good idea of the overall condition 
              and how well the entire car has been maintained. 
            <P> Check the mileage to be sure the car has not been used too much 
              for the price being asked. Today's cars average approximately 12,000 
              miles per year. In addition, compare the service stickers on the 
              door jamb or under the hood to see if the recorded mileage is consistent 
              with the odometer reading. It is possible to obtain a history of 
              service as well, depending on where the vehicle was serviced. 
            <P> Check the condition of the seats, belts and carpeting. Lap belts 
              and shoulder harnesses should be in good shape with no rips, tears 
              or frayed webbing. The upholstery should be clean with no large 
              rips or cracks. 
            <P> Check the windows to see if they open and close easily. Manual 
              windows should crank smoothly. Power windows should not hesitate. 
              All glass should be free from serious cracks or scratches. 
            <P> Look at the brake, accelerator and clutch. These pedals should 
              work smoothly without strange noises or binding. Check all exterior 
              lights and flashers on the car to ensure they are operating properly. 
              Start the engine and check the warning lights and gauges as well 
              as all the accessories to make sure they work. Make certain that 
              the air conditioning blows very cold air. 
            <P> Check the glove box for the owner's manual. It contains maintenance 
              information and important data on engine tuning, fluid capacities 
              and replacement parts. 
            <P> A used car does not depreciate as rapidly as it did when it was 
              first driven from a dealership brand new. However, it is possible 
              to get someone else's &quot;lemon&quot;. Be aware of hidden and 
              extra costs, such as rustproofing or extended warranties that you 
              may not want. 
            <P> Other common add-ons include:

            <P> Extended warranties are generally offered by manufacturers to 
              cover major drivetrain parts (engine, transaxle, transmission, etc.) 
              at an extra cost. Some of these warranties may include a deductible 
              that is paid by the owner. Service contracts and &quot;wrap-around&quot; 
              warranties are offered by manufacturers and warranty companies. 
              They generally cover repairs for a longer period than the manufacturer's 
              drivetrain warranties. They operate like an insurance policy and 
              are regulated as such in Florida. For information on service contracts, 
              check with the Florida Department of Insurance at 1-800-342-2762. 
            <P> Do not be afraid to take up the salespersons' time. Be sure to 
              stay in control and do not let anyone talk you into buying a vehicle 
              you do not want. Likewise, do not be afraid to walk away, especially 
              if &quot;the deal won't be there tomorrow&quot;. If it sounds too 
              good to be true, it generally is. Shop during daylight hours in 
              order to thoroughly inspect the vehicle and take a test drive. Be 
              sure to drive the car under a variety of conditions, such as hills, 
              highways and in stop-and-go traffic. This should be a fairly extensive 
              drive, not just a drive around the block. 
            <P> A car's good points or problems are often apparent after a few 
              miles. If the engine was warm when you arrived to look at the car, 
              it may mean the seller has been running it to hide starting difficulties.

            <P class="section"> <a name="8"><strong>Drive Test</strong></a></P>
            <p> Start the engine and press down on the brake. The brake pedal 
              should go down only an inch or two and should feel firm and solid, 
              not spongy. Press down on the brakes for about a minute. If the 
              pedal sinks slowly, there may be a leak in the master cylinder. 
              As the engine warms up, listen for any noises such as knocks, ticking 
              and rattles, which could indicate engine problems. Next, put the 
              car in neutral and rev the engine. Look in the rear view mirror 
              to see if there is any smoke coming out of the exhaust. If there 
              is a lot of white or bluish smoke, the engine may need an overhaul. 
            <P> At idle, the engine should be smooth and quiet. Punch the gas 
              pedal to see if the engine responds without hesitation and then 
              returns to normal idle. When first starting out, drive slowly to 
              get the feel of the car. The automatic transmission should shift 
              smoothly without jerking, slipping or hesitating. A manual transmission 
              should shift smoothly between gears without grinding. The clutch 
              should engage and disengage smoothly without grabbing or chattering 
              and don't forget to make sure the reverse works. Drive on a flat, 
              smooth road and lift your hands slightly from the wheel. The car 
              should track straight and be stable without vibration. If the car 
              pulls in either direction or &quot;shimmies&quot;, a front end alignment 
              or other front end repairs may be necessary. 
            <P> To test the brakes, accelerate to 30 to 40 miles per hour. Make 
              sure there are no cars behind you, then step hard on the brake pedal, 
              but do not lock the wheels. The brakes should grab evenly and the 
              car should slow down in a straight line. If the car pulls to the 
              left or right, it indicates the need for brake adjustment or a system 
              re-build. A grinding noise indicates badly worn pads or linings. 
              Drive at 35 miles per hour and listen for any unusual noises. If 
              you hear a whining sound from the rear-end, it may need replacing. 
            <P> Next, accelerate to 45 miles per hour. If the front end shakes 
              or vibrates, the tires probably need balancing. Drive quickly over 
              a rough road and listen for any loud squeaks or rattles. If the 
              car bounces or bangs over small bumps, the shock absorbers may be 
              worn and need replacing. After you have driven the car for a while, 
              check the temperature gauge to see if it shows a high reading or 
              if the temperature warning light (be sure this works!) comes on. 
              These are signs of trouble with the cooling system and they can 
              be very expensive. 
            <P> To test engine response, accelerate hard on an empty road. The 
              car should respond immediately. Back off and hit the gas again. 
              There should be no hesitation or smoke from the car. The engine 
              should accelerate smoothly with no strange noises. You may want 
              to find a steep hill to check the engine's power. If there is a 
              significant loss in power while climbing, the car may need an overhaul 
              or a tune-up. While you're on the hill, test out the hand brake 
              to make sure that it holds the car. When you are through with the 
              test drive, it's a good idea to turn off the car for a minute or 
              two. Then restart the engine to see how well it starts when hot. 
              Check again for leaks under the hood and beneath the car. Some leaks 
              may only appear after driving. It's also a good idea to check the 
              tailpipe. An engine that is burning oil will leave a black, sooty 
              oil deposit. A white, powdery residue usually means good fuel combustion.

            <p> Is the physical condition of the car consistent with the mileage 
              on the odometer? The odometer reading is an accepted means of determining 
              the dollar value of a motor vehicle. If the vehicle is in exceptionally 
              good condition, perhaps items were replaced due to excessive wear. 
              Also look for scratches on the odometer/dashboard, misaligned digits, 
              digits that stick or an odometer that fits loosely. Any of these 
              may indicate odometer tampering. 
            <P> If you suspect that the odometer has been rolled back on a vehicle 
              offered for sale, contact your local law enforcement agency or the 
              DMV. If you suspect odometer fraud has occurred with a vehicle you 
              have already purchased, the DMV can assist you in obtaining a record 
              of all previous Florida owners and odometer statements from the 
              dealers involved. If your suspicions are confirmed, you will need 
              to retain an attorney in order to file suit against the violator. 
              Due to the importance of the odometer reading in determining the 
              value and condition of a vehicle, state and federal laws have been 
              enacted making it illegal to tamper with a vehicle's odometer. <B> 
              Under the law it is illegal to:</B> 
            <UL>
              <LI>Disconnect an odometer.

            <p class="answer"> Ask if the vehicle has ever been in an accident. 
              Find out as much as possible about the car's prior history and maintenance 
              record. If you are purchasing the car from a dealer, contact the 
              previous owner to verify the mileage and condition of the car. If 
              the dealer will not provide this information, write down the vehicle 
              identification number, which is usually visible through the windshield 
              on the driver's side. With the vehicle identification number, you 
              can contact your local tax collector's office or the DMV to obtain 
              the previous owners' name. </p>
            <p class="answer"> For a small fee the National Automobile Dealer's 
              Association, (800) 274-2277, will run a title search on a vehicle. 
              The search will tell you in which cities and states the vehicle

            <p class="answer"> After you've checked out the car thoroughly and 
              are seriously considering buying it, you should take it to a trusted 
              mechanic or auto diagnostic service (again, check the Better Business 
              Bureau) before you make a final decision. </p>
            <p class="answer"> The money spent on checking the car out may save 
              you a lot more money and hassle in the long run. After a close look 
              by a professional, an attractive automobile may not turn out to 
              be as mechanically good as it appears. </p>
            <p class="answer"> The best place to have the car inspected is at 
              a dealership that sells and services the same make of car. The mechanics 
              there will be familiar with the car and know what problems to look 
              for. They also have the sophisticated computer equipment needed 
              to analyze today's cars. </p>
            <p class="answer"> If the car does have some problems, ask the mechanic 
              the approximate cost of repairing any defects. Minor problems which 
              can easily be repaired can be used to negotiate a lower price but 
              a car with major problems should be avoided. Think long and hard 
              before buying a flood damaged or rebuilt car, or one with serious 
              problems that you may not have the additional money to repair. </p>

              that is designed specifically for Hillsborough County. A copy of 
              the form goes to the customer at the time of sale as well. This

            <P class="section"> <a name="14"><strong>As-Is Or Warranty</strong></a></P>
            <p> All dealers are required by Federal law to post a &quot;buyers 
              guide&quot; in the window of each vehicle offered for sale. The 
              buyers guide notifies the buyer that there is a warranty or that 
              the vehicle is being sold &quot;AS-IS&quot; with no warranty of 
              any kind. </p>
            <p class="answer"> In the case of an &quot;AS-IS&quot; sale, once 
              you drive the vehicle from the dealership, it belongs to you, despite 
              any problems the vehicle may have. If the vehicle breaks down after 
              only a few minutes of leaving the dealership, the repairs are <B>YOUR 
              </B>responsibility. </p>
            <p class="answer"> Sometimes the most important difference between 
              vehicles is not under the hood or in the extra equipment offered 
              but rather is tucked away in the product packaging - the Warranty 
              Card. While you think nothing will ever happen to your newly purchased 
              vehicle, problems will surface. The better the warranty, the less 
              you will pay for those unexpected repair bills. </p>
            <p class="answer"> When comparing warranty policies, longer is better. 
              However, be cautious of policies that are too long or have unrealistic 
              requirements -- the company may not be around later when the vehicle 
              needs service. Be sure to ask:

            </UL>
            <p></p>
            <p class="answer"> Keep your warranty safe, it should be kept with 
              receipts. Make a copy and keep it in a separate location. Some companies 
              are lax while others require you to have the original warranty with 
              you when repairs are performed. Be sure to be specific in following 
              the manufacturer's warranty requirements. </p>
            <p class="answer"> The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act of 1975 requires 
              that warranties be available for reading before purchase. Unfortunately 
              some companies do not comply with this requirement. No reputable 
              dealer runs afoul of this law, but their administrative procedures 
              for providing this information are sometimes incomplete. Under this 
              federal law, you can sue based on breach of express warranties, 
              implied warranties or a service contract. </p>
            <p class="answer"> The bottom line is: read warranties carefully, 
              especially the fine print. Be sure to obtain copies of the documents 
              you sign. Be sure that any other papers you sign match what you 
              agreed to. There have been occasions where a &quot;buyers guide&quot; 
              reflected a warranty, but the contract stated &quot;AS-IS&quot;. 
              In this case, government agencies would view this as an &quot;AS-IS&quot; 
              sale. </p>
            <p class="answer"> Remember, there is no warranty or agreement unless 
              it is in writing and signed by all parties. Get any promises made

              requires all vehicles licensed within the state to have insurance. 
              Without this proof, the dealer cannot complete the transfer of title 
              and registration into the consumers' name. </p>

            <P class="section"> <a name="17"><strong>Declining Value</strong></a></P>
            <p> Almost every car loses value as it ages. Large luxury cars and 
              subcompacts tend to depreciate at the fastest rate. Domestic cars 
              tend to depreciate faster than comparable imports. </p>
            <p class="answer"> Used cars with the highest resale value are typically 
              best selling new models with desirable options like air conditioning, 
              power steering and cruise control. If you end up paying a little 
              more than you had expected for that perfect used car, it is not 
              the end of the world. In the long run, you are much better off with 
              a car that you are happy with than one that you saved a few dollars 
              on.
