  <p><img src="images/walter_in_studio.jpg" width="253" height="223" align="left" /></p><h4>In Loving Memory</h4>
  <p>Walter Kamys, esteemed professor of Art, died on Saturday, August 10, 2013 at the Elaine Center in Hadley, MA just months after celebrating his 96th birthday with family and friends at his home in Sunderland, MA.  </p>
  <p>Walter received his degree from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1943. In 1962, Walter accepted a temporary position with the Art Department at UMass Amherst&#8212;a position which quickly became permanent. By the end of the decade, Walter was awarded tenure and a full Professorship. He went on to found and direct the Art Acquisition Program, which focused on works on paper and its collection grew to more than 600 pieces before his retirement in 1987.  </p>
  <p>A prolific artist, Walter's passion for painting and drawing informed his approach to art education. He brought the excitement he expereinced in his studio with him into the classroom. (See Walter's work <a href="http://www.walterkamys.com/index.html">here</a>.)  </p>
  <p>Walter Kamys lived a full and productive life on his own terms, touching the lives of thousands of students, friends and colleagues. He will be remembered and missed by many.</p>

 <h4>Classics student  selected as a Rising Researcher </h4>
 <p>As we celebrate our   sesquicentennial, the campus launches &quot;Rising Researcher&quot; - a new   program to honor students whose achievements exemplify the quality of   research, scholarship, and creative activity conducted by UMass Amherst   undergraduates. The &quot;inaugural four&quot; are ones to watch as they build a   record of success in their chosen fields. Tess Brickley &rsquo;15, Commonwealth Honors College <a href="http://www.umass.edu/classics/" rel="nofollow">classics</a> major is working with digital archaeological materials from the Pompeii   Quadriporticus Project under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.umass.edu/classics/poehler.htm" rel="nofollow">Eric Poehler</a>. Brickley so impressed Poehler as a freshman in his Roman archeology class that he offered her a research assistant position. &ldquo;Tess has truly excelled in every task she has been given. One of   the first was analyzing data from 74 columns in our building, the   Quadriporticus at Pompeii, and discovering patterns within the hundreds   of holes cut into those columns. Thinking through the process of the   task I gave her was itself challenging, but then visualizing the results   was especially impressive. I presented the results at a major   international conference in January to great interest,&rdquo; says Poehler.</p>
