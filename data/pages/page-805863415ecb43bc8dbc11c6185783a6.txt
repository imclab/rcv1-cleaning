It's still something where it's rare to see someone who is an amputee and a lot of times I think you might see someone who is but might not know about the disability. I don't think I thought of it, it wasn't even in my ether that it could happen to one of the characters on the show."</p><p><b>The amputation's impact on Arizona and Callie's marriage</b>: "It's a very complicated reckoning. If you lose something that's that important to you like a limb -- and it's the only thing that Arizona said in the preview: 'Don't let them take my leg' --  she sees Callie as her guardian. It's really hard: the worst thing thing that's ever happened to this woman is going to come as the hands of the person that's supposed to be the best thing in her life. That's a very rich dilemma. The story is going to be about how to come to terms with that and how to figure that out. Of course there's going to be blame and Arizona definitely sees herself as a victim in this. This happened to her, she didn't do anything to make this happen."</p><p><b>How Arizona's recovery will play out this season</b>: "There's a strong commitment to telling the story authentically. It's going to be as close to what the real story would be if this happened as it possibly can be. There's loss, rehabilitation, how will she become mobile again, using what devices. That's going to be a big thing. The intent is not to spend the entire season with her struggling and trying to find the way. There will be some resolution and understanding as well as some coming to reckonings if you will early on. It's not all darkness and brimstone; it's trying to get through this. There's no light without dark and there is no dark without light. You have to have both to understand what the other is in relation to itself. That's what the beginning of this season is for her."</p><p><b>What will change between Arizona and Alex (Justin Chambers)?</b>: "Arizona's two most important relationships at Seattle Grace are Callie and Karev. Her relationship with Karev has always been very intimate; she's always been a mentor to him and told him to believe in himself more than he thinks he should even believe in himself. She felt very betrayed by the end of last season when he was going to leave after she'd done all she'd done. She yanks him of the plane and look what happened. Arizona always has been so perky and present and always says things you'd wish you'd say in a moment and has the outlook that you wish you'd had. For first time, she's actually saying things that sound a lot more honest and in the moment so there's definitely blame and resentment. She is a devastating circumstance and she blames everyone."</p><script type="text/javascript">printTagsAndPhotos();</script></div></div>

" align="left" title="Eric Dane [ID=1599617]" style="margin: 0px 5px 10px 0px; float: right; width: 420px;" /></p><p><i>Grey's Anatomy</i> fans had to reach for the Kleenex during Thursday's Season 9 premiere. </p><p>It was titled <i><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy/episode-detail/going-going-gone/1017496?page=1" title="http://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy/episode-detail/going-going-gone/1017496?page=1">Going, going, gone</a></i> -- and now we know why. </p><p>SPOILERS ahead: </p><p>Our favorite docs were coping with the aftermath of the plane crash that took the life of Lexie Grey, and the voiceover: "Dying changes everything."  </p><p>Dr. Mark "McSteamy" Sloan (Eric Dane) was hooked up to a ventilator. He's been in a coma for a month and, according to his will, he's going to be taken off of it at 5:00. It's particularly hard for his two best pals, Derek Shepherd and Callie Torres. Meredith Grey has earned the nickname Medusa because she's such a meanie. Dr. Bailey is happy and into bootie calls. Cristina Yang is off in Minnesota where she's having a tough time fitting in. Alex is leaving/not leaving for his new job at Johns Hopkins. Owen is hunting down April to beg her to come back to doctoring. And Arizona, it seems, has died in the plane crash until it's revealed near the end of the show that Callie had to amputate the lower part of her leg! </p><p>"I am infinitely delighted that Arizona lives," Jessica Capshaw <a href="http://https://twitter.com/JessicaCapshaw/status/251567854397313026" title="http://https//twitter.com/JessicaCapshaw/status/251567854397313026">tweeted</a> after the premiere. "How she lives in this season will certainly be a wild ride. I thank you all for your support."</p><p>As for Eric Dane's exit? <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/349596/grey-s-anatomy-why-did-spoiler-alert-have-to-die-insiders-spill-scoop" title="http://www.eonline.com/news/349596/grey-s-anatomy-why-did-spoiler-alert-have-to-die-insiders-spill-scoop">E! is reporting</a> that budget cuts prompted the move, saying show exec Shonda Rhimes had to trim the cast. </p><p>Dane told <a href="http://tvline.com/2012/07/26/grey-anatomy-eric-dane-leaving/" title="http://tvline.com/2012/07/26/grey-anatomy-eric-dane-leaving/">TV Line</a> back in July that he was "extremely grateful" for the run. </p><p>And Rhimes at the time, indicated it was a joint decision, saying his McSteamy was "one of the most beloved characters on <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>." She added that Dane "did not come to this decision lightly, but after much consideration and conversations, he and I have decided that this is the right time for his storyline to end.</p><script type="text/javascript">printTagsAndPhotos();</script></div></div>

JT likes to entertain, and it sounds like he does it well. Timberlake recently sat down with <i><a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/blogsandforums/blogs/badaily/2012/09/justin-timberlake-interview.html" title="http://www.bonappetit.com/blogsandforums/blogs/badaily/2012/09/justin-timberlake-interview.html">Bon Appetit</a></i> to talk about his hosting style. Among the highlights:</p><p><b>On being a great host: </b>"The key to good hosting is to make sure everyone has enough to eat--and booze on. In my house, we tend to host Sunday barbecues, which is convenient in football season. Everybody can do chips and dips. But a good friend of ours, Jon Rollo--one of the founders of Greenleaf in L.A.--will send over pretzel bite sandwiches and flatbread pizzas. He'll send over fennel salads. Don't get me wrong: I can never turn guacamole down. But this is a healthy alternative to loading your face with cans of Rotel."</p><p><b>His philosophy on being a good host:</b> " If you're hosting people, you want them to feel like they're in their own home. I don't like things to be too formal. I've hosted Halloween murder mystery dinners where people had to search through the house for clues. We did one that was Prohibition era-themed. The girls showed up as flappers and the guys showed up in waistcoats and pinstripes. At some point, people will drink enough to be hungry, so you need enough food. I've hosted parties where I'll  have an In-and-Out truck show up later on in the evening. You know everyone will be hungry again."</p><p class="jump"><a class="jump" href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2012/09/27/justin-timberlake-talks-bbq-booze/70001295/1">Read more  &#0187;</a></p><script type="text/javascript">printTagsAndPhotos();</script></div></div>
