<image width="770" height="400" border="0" alt="Bob Elston's coupe" src="/dslv_LF_770x400.jpg"><br><br>

Here's a glance at where we're going. The coupe shown above, built back in 1964 and still owned by Russell DeSalvo, looks a lot like what I want to end up
with. (There's an article about Russell's car on <a href="http://www.roadsters.com/deuce/">another page</a>).<br><br>

Restored original sheet metal along with wheels, tires, and stance are all you need to get a Deuce looking great.<br><br>

The goal here is something comfortable and reliable. When it's finished, the coupe will be a well-detailed, full-fendered resto-rod with lots of neat old
parts.<br><br>

Other than replacing the floor that was cut out long before I bought it, and mounting a pair of original 1948 Chevy taillights below the trunk lid, the body
will be restored to the way it was originally built. On this car, there's absolutely no need for a chopped top, hidden door hinges, a filled cowl vent, or a
filled roof. Besides, those things make original cars look like the plastic ones.<br><br>

These cars have great lines. The more I work on this car, the more appreciation I have for what it was.<br><br>

With its unique Murray body, the 1932 Ford three-window coupe is an outstanding design. Many of the body parts don't interchange with other Deuce bodies. It's
also a very rare car. There were only 22,148 of them built, compared to 51,794 five-window coupes, and 124,101 Tudor sedans.<br><br>

The frame is ready to be welded together, and we're still working on some of the small parts for the car, getting ready to put the chassis together. Currently,
all of the chassis parts are being polished to get them ready for assembly. The rear fenders arrived back in April of 2007 and are ready to be metal-finished.
New pictures are added to this page whenever there's something new.<br><br>

The body is now sitting in a carpeted area of the shop, up on jack stands, at about the rake it will have when it's on the road, with the hood and grille
clamped in place.<br><br>

<image width="770" height="459" border="0" alt="Dave Mann's coupe" src="/1943_770x459.jpg"><br><br>

Here's the seat that I bought from Mike Mitchell in Santee, California in January of 2009. It came out of his cherry original Deuce three-window.<br><br>

The coupe will have a full set of original fenders. I've found and bought four good left front fenders and one good right front, and a decent pair of back
fenders.<br><br>

Back in the fall of 2003, I spent some time working on the body. The first priority was to remove all of the rust. I sprayed the outside of the body with

<a href="http://www.roadsters.com/gibbs/">Gibbs Brand</a> and then let it sit for a couple of days to penetrate into the steel, especially where there was
rust. I then sanded the entire outside of the body with a D/A sander and then went over it again with coarse Scotch-Brite. That was followed by another coat of

<a href="http://www.roadsters.com/gibbs/">Gibbs Brand</a> to protect the bare sheet metal from fingerprints and rust. Overall, the body is in great shape. It's
now ready to be metal-finished.<br><br>

<image width="770" height="226" border="0" alt="Halibrand 15 by 8" src="/hals_cp_770x226.jpg"></a><br><br>

The more exotic wheels for the coupe are Halibrand magnesium 15 by 8 and 15 by 4 1/2 Sprint that I've cleaned, sanded, and given a brushed finish.<br><br>

While magnesium wheels aren't considered practical for a street car, 

<a href="http://www.roadsters.com/gibbs/">Gibbs Brand</a> keeps them looking good without oxidizing.<br><br>

With all of the body filler removed, there's some metal-finishing work to be done. This picture barely shows the roof insert, which still has all of the
original wood and wire intact.<br><br>

<image width="770" height="760" border="0" alt="Dave Mann's coupe" src="/cp_olds_770x760.jpg"><br><br>

Here's the coupe with the '57-'64 Olds rear end. This is one of several Olds rear ends that I bought and cleaned up. First, I cleaned the housing and then had
it sandblasted. Then I went over the housing with a three-inch, 80-grit sanding disc in a die grinder, working out all of the pits. More work with 80-grit
followed, this time with a five-inch disc in a D/A sander. From there, it was just a matter of sanding out the small scratches with the D/A.<br><br>

<image width="770" height="190" border="0" alt="Dave Mann's coupe" src="/olds_770x190.jpg"><br><br>

Here's another shot of the Olds rear end. As it sits now, most of it has been sanded up to 800-grit. So far, the total time I spent on this housing is two
evenings.<br><br>

This car must have been channeled at one point, because the entire floor had been cut out of the car. Since the original subrails were left intact and are in
good shape, installing a new floor will be straightforward. This one is ready to be welded in place. It was made in one piece, cut with a laser, and measures
just over eight feet long.<br><br>

One of the things you learn from building an original Deuce three-window from scratch, without some of the pieces to the puzzle, is how hard it can be to find
good original parts. Sometimes you don't even know what to look for, since Ford used several different versions of some of their parts. When you find cherry
examples of them (parts that are taken for granted on later and more-common cars), you must be having a good day.<br><br>

<image align="right" width="500" height="120" border="0" alt="1932 Ford coupe trim" src="/a-pillar_trim_500x120.jpg">

Here's the one A-pillar trim piece I have. I still need one for the driver's side, so if you know of an original one that's available, please let know.<br><br>

Both of the door window moldings are in bare metal, ready for paint or plating. An-equally perfect rear window molding, which I bought complete with its
original maroon paint, has also been sanded and polished.<br><br>

Some of the original 1932 Ford parts we bought that aren't shown here include two very good sets of running boards, an NORS pair of running board covers, two
sets of running board brackets, a repairable splash apron, a pair of the correct splash apron bolts, several V-8 headlight bars, a V-8 emblem for the headlight
bar, a set of NOS headlight bar bolts, a set of NOS bumper bolts, and two sets of rear frame horn covers in nice shape.<br><br>

The hood is made up from pieces that came from two sources. In May of 2002, after my twisting his arm a few times, Jim Cameron in Oregon agreed to sell me his
only pair of the rare and cherry 25-louver hood sides for only $150. Since then, whenever our paths cross, I shake his hand.<br><br>

The hood's top panels and the headlights came from here in Arizona, thanks to

<a href="http://www.roadsters.com/bonneville/">Bonneville</a> racer

<a href="http://www.roadsters.com/chauvin/">Chauvin Emmons</a>, the man who back in the early Seventies designed and hand-machined the world's first billet
aluminum cylinder heads for Top Fuel cars.<br><br>

Back in 1999, <a href="http://www.roadsters.com/chauvin/">Chauvin</a> brought these parts to the

<a href="http://www.roadsters.com/bonneville/">Bonneville Salt Flats</a> for me to pick up.<br><br>

The original gas tank came from a restorer in Montana, and has since been block sanded to reveal the few low spots. Before long it will be hot tanked and then
primed. The hood will also be completely block sanded and primed, but the paint can wait until after everything has been mocked up and fitted.<br><br>

This 1932 Ford firewall was in very good shape when I bought it from Bob Elston in Oregon, who had sent it out to be chemically stripped three months
earlier.<br><br>

I have since removed most of the rust spots that formed after it was stripped, and then sprayed it with

<a href="http://www.roadsters.com/gibbs/">Gibbs Brand</a> to preserve it.<br><br>

precision polishing came next, with the result being what you see here. It feels great when you stop.

When I bought the body from Bill Blumberg, the dash didn't come with it. Seeing how expensive the original three-window dashes are led me to come up with an
alternative that would also have room for more gauges.<br><br>

The dash that's shown mounted in the coupe was made in Sweden. This dash is for a roadster, so a new top will have to be fabricated and installed. The flat
roadster dash provides room for all the gauges you could want to use.<br><br>

After that, in August of 2005, I heard back from the man who sold me the car. He said he had finally found the original dash that came with the body. A
previous owner had cut the center out of it, and made a hardwood insert that covered it.<br><br>

The steel surrounding the center of the dash is untouched, and again remembering what three-window dashes are now selling for, this one can be saved. I sent a
picture of it to

<a href="http://www.salinasboys.com/" target="resource window">metal master Cole Foster</a>, and he agreed to repair it. I wanted some of Cole's work on this
car anyway.

Although I'm looking forward to getting it on the road, there's no rush for me to finish this car. I'm only going to build it once, so everything about it has
to be done right.<br><br>

I've wanted this car since the first time I saw one, back in the mid-Sixties. I can wait a bit longer.

This car has been built into a hot rod by each of its two previous owners in the last thirty years, but it hasn't been on the street since the early
1970s.<br><br>

The coupe was bought in Washington state in July of 2003. Its owner offered it to me because he knew that I'd give it an appreciative home, instead of just
selling it.<br><br>

Some of the original parts for the car that were included but not shown here include the cowl vent lid, the dashboard, the door handles, the grille shell, the
grille insert, the header panel above the windshield, the headlight bar, the headlights, the radiator, the radiator support rods, the running boards, the
splash apron, the title, all three of the inside window moldings, and the two windshield frames.<br>

The following pictures show the body exactly as it was found.<br><br>

For the past few years, most of the body had been in bare metal, with some areas covered with a very thin layer of spot putty left over from its last paint
job, which was metallic blue.<br>

This view of the right side of the body shows that many years ago, the centers of both inside door panels were cut away.<br><br>

So far we've found one of the missing pieces, and the other one will probably show up with the rest of the parts for the car.<br><br>

This looks a lot worse than it is. There was a bit of rust at the bottoms of the doors and on the rocker panels, but it won't be hard to repair properly.<br>

The roughest part of the body is the panel below the trunk. Many years ago, the car had a pair of taillights installed in on the back of the body, and the
recess for the gas tank filler was filled in.<br><br>

It will all be brought back to the way it was originally.<br>

The outside of the trunk lid is in good shape.<br><br>

This is one of the many parts that are unique to this body style.<br><br>

Measured at the bottom, 1932 Ford three-window coupe trunk lids are 38 3/4" wide, while the trunk lids for
roadsters and five-window coupes are 35 1/2" wide, which is 3 1/4" narrower.<br>

it.<br>

A <a href="http://www.roadsters.com/reprosteel/" target="_top">Reprosteel firewall</a> is ideal for this car. It's
accurate enough to look right, trimming it to fit the transmission won't be an issue, it will provide more room
for chassis parts, and it's affordable.<br><br>

These parts came with the coupe. Since the car was channeled, the grille shell was chopped. Fortunately, the grille insert was left intact, and could be
restored.<br><br>
