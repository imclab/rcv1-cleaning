	Arnold Bennett (1867-1931), John Galsworthy (1867-1933) or H. G. Wells 
	(1886-1946). It is today increasingly evident that this distinction is far 
	from straightforward, and that the most revered names among the modernists 
	(James, Conrad, the early D. H. Lawrence, even Joyce) often wrote in an 
	'Edwardian' way. The influential novelist and critic Ford Madox Ford 
	(1873-1939), a major figure in contemporary thinking about literary form, 
	who scoffed at amateurish 'nuvvles', nevertheless published, as editor of 
	the <i>English</i> <i>Review</i>, Bennett and Galsworthy, as well as James, Conrad, the 
	Voracist Wyndham Lewis and Ezra Pound. His four-volume masterpiece. <i>Parade's

	devices, can be seen as a direct successor of the old, three-decked, 
	'condition-of-Fngland' type novel. Altogether, Modernism was more pragmatic 
	than is often assumed.</font></blockquote>

		PSYCHOLOGY<br></b><br>Probably no one had more influence on modern literature than the Viennese 
	psychologist and founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). In an 
	elegy written on Freud's death, W. H. Auden called him, without 
	exaggeration, &quot;no more a person now but a climate of opinion'.<br>Freud's ideas arose from his study of neuroses. Freudian criticism, though 
	perhaps not Freud himself, sees creativity as a form of sublimation, 
	typically deriving from traumatic experiences in childhood, and art as a 
	pathological phenomenon. In the words of the critic Lionel I rilling, 'the 
	poet is a poet by reason of his sickness as well as by reason of his power'. 
	I he greatest impact of Freud himself resulted from his theories of the 
	unconscious mind and the nature of repression, his study of the development 
	of sexual instincts in young children, and his 'interpretation of dreams' 
	(the title of his first great book). Many of his ideas have given rise to 
	popularised conceptions with which everyone is now familiar: for example, 
	the Oedipus Complex, the sexual rivalry between a son and father for the 
	mother (whence the Electra Complex, rivalry between daughter and mother for 
	the father); the death wish; phallic symbols, the significance, conscious or 
	unconscious, of any penis-shaped object as a symbol of male sexuality; penis 
	envy, the desire of a girl for such an organ. The latter doctrine in 
	particular has aroused outrage amongst feminists, and in fact very little of 
	Freud's teaching is now accepted without considerable qualification. 
	However, that does not lessen its impact on the modernists.<br>Freud would have been less influential had he not also been a fine writer. 
	Some of his case studies are true works of art, and he was also a 
	penetrating literary critic, his writings on Hamlet, Oedipus and other 
	characters marking the beginning of a long, continuous, tradition of 
	Freudian biography.</font></blockquote>

		</font><br><i><font size="1">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>
		</font></i><br><font size="2">Valentin Louis Georges Eugène Marcel Proust (10 July 1871 &#8211; 
	18 November 1922) was a French novelist, essayist and critic, best known as 
	the author of À la recherche du temps perdu (in English, In Search of Lost 
	Time; earlier translated as Remembrance of Things Past), a monumental work 
	of twentieth-century fiction published in seven parts from 1913 to 1927. <br>Proust was born in Auteuil (the southern sector of Paris's then-rustic 16th 
	arrondissement) at the home of his great-uncle, two months after the Treaty 
	of Frankfurt formally ended the Franco-Prussian War. His birth took place 
	during the violence that surrounded the suppression of the Paris Commune, 
	and his childhood corresponds with the consolidation of the French Third 
	Republic. Much of In Search of Lost Time concerns the vast changes, most 
	particularly the decline of the aristocracy and the rise of the middle 
	classes, that occurred in France during the Third Republic and the fin de 
	siècle. Proust's father, Achille Adrien Proust, was a prominent pathologist 
	and epidemiologist, responsible for studying and attempting to remedy the 
	causes and movements of cholera through Europe and Asia; he was the author 
	of many articles and books on medicine and hygiene. Proust's mother, Jeanne 
	Clémence Weil, was the daughter of a well-off and cultured Jewish family. 
	She was a literate and well-read woman. Her letters demonstrate a 
	well-developed sense of humour, and her command of English was sufficient 
	for her to provide the necessary impetus to her son's later attempts to 
	translate John Ruskin.By the age of nine, Proust had had his first serious 
	asthma attack, and thereafter he was considered by himself, his family and 
	his friends as a sickly child. Proust spent long holidays in the village of 
	Illiers. This village, combined with aspects of the time he spent at his 
	great-uncle's house in Auteuil became the model for the fictional town of 
	Combray, where some of the most important scenes of In Search of Lost Time 
	take place. (Illiers was renamed Illiers-Combray on the occasion of the 
	Proust centenary celebrations). Despite his poor health, Proust served a 
	year (1889&#8211;90) as an enlisted man in the French army, stationed at Coligny 
	Caserne in Orléans, an experience that provided a lengthy episode in The 
	Guermantes' Way, part three of his novel. As a young man, Proust was a 
	dilettante and a social climber, whose aspirations as a writer were hampered 
	by his lack of application. His reputation from this period, as a snob and 
	an amateur, contributed to his later troubles with getting Swann's Way, the 
	first part of his large-scale novel, published in 1913. Proust had a close 
	relationship with his mother. In order to appease his father, who insisted 
	that he pursue a career, Proust obtained a volunteer position at the 
	Bibliothèque Mazarine in the summer of 1896. After exerting considerable 
	effort, he obtained a sick leave which was to extend for several years until 
	he was considered to have resigned. He never worked at his job, and he did 
	not move from his parents' apartment until after both were dead (Tadié).<br>Proust, who was homosexual, was one of the first European novelists to treat 
	homosexuality openly and at length. His life and family circle changed 
	considerably between 1900 and 1905. In February 1903, Proust's brother 
	Robert married and left the family home. His father died in September of the 
	same year. Finally, and most crushingly, Proust's beloved mother died in 
	September 1905, leaving him a considerable inheritance. (In today's terms, a 
	principal of about $6 million, with a monthly income of about $15,000.) His 
	health throughout this period continued to deteriorate. Proust spent the 
	last three years of his life largely confined to his cork-lined bedroom, 
	sleeping during the day and working at night to complete his novel. He died 
	in 1922 and is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. <br>Proust was involved in writing and publishing from an early age. In addition 
	to the literary magazines with which he was associated, and in which he 
	published, while at school, La Revue verte and La Revue lilas, from 1890&#8211;91 
	Proust published a regular society column in the journal Le Mensuel (Tadie). 
	In 1892 he was involved in founding a literary review called Le Banquet 
	(also the French title of Plato's Symposium), and throughout the next 
	several years Proust published small pieces regularly in this journal and in 
	the prestigious La Revue Blanche. In 1896 Les Plaisirs et les Jours, a 
	compendium of many of these early pieces, was published. The book included a 
	foreword by Anatole France, drawings by Mme. Lemaire, and was so sumptuously 
	produced that it cost twice the normal price of a book its size. That year 
	Proust also began working on a novel which was eventually published in 1954 
	and titled Jean Santeuil by his posthumous editors. Many of the themes later 
	developed in In Search of Lost Time find their first articulation in this 
	unfinished work, including the enigma of memory and the necessity of 
	reflection; several sections of In Search of Lost Time can be read in first 
	draft in Jean Santeuil. The portrait of the parents in Jean Santeuil is 
	quite harsh, in marked contrast to the adoration with which the parents are 
	painted in Proust's masterpiece. Following the poor reception of Les 
	Plaisirs et les Jours, and internal troubles with resolving the plot, Proust 
	gradually abandoned Jean Santeuil in 1897 and stopped work on it entirely by 
	1899. <br>Beginning in 1895 Proust spent several years reading Carlyle, Emerson and 
	John Ruskin. Through this reading Proust began to refine his own theories of 
	art and the role of the artist in society. Also, in Time Regained Proust's 
	universal protagonist recalls having translated Ruskin's Sesame and Lilies. 
	The artist's responsibility is to confront the appearance of nature, deduce 
	its essence and retell or explain that essence in the work of art. Ruskin's 
	view of artistic production was central to this conception, and Ruskin's 
	work was so important to Proust that he claimed to know &quot;by heart&quot; several 
	of Ruskin's books, including The Seven Lamps of Architecture, The Bible of 
	Amiens, and Praeterita (Tadié 350). Proust set out to translate two of 
	Ruskin's works into French, but was hampered by an imperfect command of 
	English. In order to compensate for this he made his translations a group 
	affair: sketched out by his mother, the drafts were first revised by Proust, 
	then by Marie Nordlinger, the English cousin of his friend and sometime 
	lover Reynaldo Hahn, then by Proust again finally polished. Confronted about 
	his method by an editor, Proust responded, &quot;I don't claim to know English; I 
	claim to know Ruskin&quot; (Tadié). The Bible of Amiens, with Proust's extended 
	introduction, was published in French in 1904. Both the translation and the 
	introduction were very well reviewed; Henri Bergson called Proust's 
	introduction &quot;an important contribution to the psychology of Ruskin&quot; and had 
	similar praise for the translation (Tadié 433). At the time of this 
	publication, Proust was already at work on translating Ruskin's Sesame and 
	Lilies, which he completed in June 1905, just prior to his mother's death, 
	and published in 1906. Literary historians and critics have ascertained 
	that, apart from Ruskin, Proust's chief literary influences included Saint 
	Simon, Montaigne, Stendhal, Flaubert, George Eliot, Fyodor Dostoevsky and 
	Leo Tolstoy. 1908 was an important year for Proust's development as a 
	writer. During the first part of the year he published in various journals 
	pastiches of other writers. These exercises in imitation may have allowed 
	Proust to solidify his own style. In addition, in the spring and summer of 
	the year Proust began work on several different fragments of writing that 
	would later coalesce under the working title of Contre Saint-Beuve. Proust 
	described what he was working on in a letter to a friend: &quot;I have in 
	progress: a study on the nobility, a Parisian novel, an essay on 
	Sainte-Beuve and Flaubert, an essay on women, an essay on pederasty (not 
	easy to publish), a study on stained-glass windows, a study on tombstones, a 
	study on the novel&quot; (Tadié 513). From these disparate fragments Proust began 
	to shape a novel on which he worked continually during this period. The 
	rough outline of the work centered on a first-person narrator, unable to 
	sleep, who during the night remembers waiting as a child for his mother to 
	come to him in the morning. The novel was to have ended with a critical 
	examination of Sainte-Beuve and a refutation of his theory that biography 
	was the most important tool for understanding an artist's work. Present in 
	the unfinished manuscript notebooks are many elements that correspond to 
	parts of the Recherche, in particular, to the &quot;Combray&quot; and &quot;Swann in Love&quot; 
	sections of Volume 1, and to the final section of Volume 7. Trouble with 
	finding a publisher, as well as a gradually changing conception of his 
	novel, led Proust to shift work to a substantially different project that 
	still contained many of the same themes and elements. By 1910 he was at work 
	on À la recherche du temps perdu. <br>Begun in 1909, À la recherche du temps perdu consists of seven volumes 
	spanning some 3,200 pages and teeming with more than 2,000 literary 
	characters. Graham Greene called Proust the &quot;greatest novelist of the 20th 
	century&quot;, and W. Somerset Maugham called the novel the &quot;greatest fiction to 
	date.&quot; Proust died before he was able to complete his revision of the drafts 
	and proofs of the final volumes, the last three of which were published 
	posthumously and edited by his brother, Robert. The book was translated into 
	English by C. K. Scott-Moncrieff, appearing as Remembrance of Things Past 
	between 1922 and 1931. In 1995, Penguin undertook a fresh translation of the 
	book by editor Christopher Prendergast and seven translators in three 
	countries, based on the latest and most authoritative French text. 
	Subsequently, the title of the novel was more accurately translated as In

		JOYCE<br><br></b>Born and raised in Catholic Ireland, <b>James Joyce</b> (1882&#8212;1941) set all his 
	fiction in his native city of Dublin, although from 1904 he abandoned 
	country and religion and lived abroad. His first, autobiographical novel, <i>A</i>
		<i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, published, largely clue to the 
	enthusiasm of Ezra Pound, in 1916, throws light on his early life and his 
	discover}' of his vocation. It adopts a stream-of-consciousness narrative 
	reflecting the hero's development and foreshadows the astonishingly original 
	use of language that characterises his greatest work, <i>Ulysses</i> (1922; not 
	published in Britain until 1936 due to alleged obscenities). Ostensibly it 
	covers a single day in the life of three characters in Dublin (Leopold and 
	Molly Bloom and Stephen Daedalus, the hero of <i>Portrait of the Artist</i>). Its 
	18 episodes roughly reflect equivalents in the Odyssey, and this mythic 
	structure contributes to the creation of an epic from superficially mundane 
	material. Past and present interact, trivial events acquire sometimes 
	profound significance, and extreme erudition mingles with coarse humour. 
	Joyce's highly allusive style, including parodies of various literary forms, 
	does not make for easy reading, and his last book <i>Finnegans Wake</i> (1939) is 
	inaccessible to the ordinary reader without a comprehensive gloss. Newcomers 
	to Joyce, possibly the most influential novelist of the century, wisely 
	start with his early short stories,<i> Dubliners</i> (1914), which are relatively 
	conventional in technique.</font></blockquote>

&nbsp;</font></i></font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (2 February 
	1882 &#8211; 13 January 1941) was an Irish expatriate writer, widely considered to 
	be one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. He is best known 
	for his landmark novel Ulysses (1922) and its highly controversial successor 
	Finnegans Wake (1939), as well as the short story collection Dubliners 
	(1914) and the semi-autobiographical novel A Portrait of the Artist as a 
	Young Man (1916). </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Although he spent most of his adult life 
	outside Ireland, Joyce's psychological and fictional universe is firmly 
	rooted in his native Dublin, the city which provides the settings and much 
	of the subject matter for all his fiction. In particular, his tempestuous 
	early relationship with the Irish Roman Catholic Church is reflected through 
	a similar inner conflict in his recurrent alter ego Stephen Dedalus. As the 
	result of his minute attentiveness to a personal locale and his self-imposed 
	exile and influence throughout Europe, notably in Paris, Joyce became 
	paradoxically one of the most cosmopolitan yet one of the most 
	regionally-focused of all the English language writers of his time.<br>&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">Dublin, 1882&#8211;1904<br>
		<br></font></b><font size="2">In 1882, James Augustine Joyce was born into a 
	Roman Catholic family in the Dublin suburb of Rathgar. He was the oldest of 
	10 surviving children; two of his siblings died of typhoid. His father's 
	family, originally from Fermoy in Cork, had once owned a small salt and lime 
	works. Joyce's father and paternal grandfather both married into wealthy 
	families. In 1887, his father, John Stanislaus Joyce, was appointed rate 
	(i.e., a local property tax) collector by Dublin Corporation; the family 
	subsequently moved to the fashionable adjacent small town of Bray 12 miles 
	(19 km) from Dublin. Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog; this 
	resulted in a lifelong canine phobia. He also suffered from a fear of 
	thunderstorms, which his deeply religious aunt had described to him as being 
	a sign of God's wrath.</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">In 1891, 
	Joyce wrote a poem, &quot;Et Tu Healy,&quot; on the death of Charles Stewart Parnell. 
	His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic church and 
	at the resulting failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The elder Joyce 
	had the poem printed and even sent a copy to the Vatican Library. In 
	November of that same year, John Joyce was entered in Stubbs Gazette (an 
	official register of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893 John 
	Joyce was dismissed with a pension. This was the beginning of a slide into 
	poverty for the family, mainly due to John's drinking and general financial 
	mismanagement. James Joyce was initially educated by the Jesuit order at 
	Clongowes Wood College, a boarding school near Sallins in County Kildare, 
	which he entered in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no 
	longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian 
	Brothers school on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a 
	place in the Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. The offer 
	was made at least partly in the hope that he would prove to have a vocation 
	and join the Order. Joyce, however, was to reject Catholicism by the age of 
	16, although the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas would remain a strong 
	influence on him throughout his life.He enrolled at the recently established 
	University College Dublin in 1898. He studied modern languages, specifically 
	English, French and Italian. He also became active in theatrical and 
	literary circles in the city. His review of Ibsen's New Drama, his first 
	published work, was published in 1900 and resulted in a letter of thanks 
	from the Norwegian dramatist himself. Joyce wrote a number of other articles 
	and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends 
	he made at University College Dublin would appear as characters in Joyce's 
	written works. He was an active member of the Literary and Historical 
	Society, University College Dublin, and presented his paper &quot;Drama and Life&quot; 
	to the L&amp;H in 1900. After graduating from UCD in 1903, Joyce left for Paris 
	to &quot;study medicine&quot;, but in reality he squandered money his family could ill 
	afford. He returned to Ireland after a few months, when his mother was 
	diagnosed with cancer. Fearing for her son's &quot;impiety&quot;, his mother tried 
	unsuccessfully to get Joyce to make his confession and to take communion. 
	She finally passed into a coma and died on August 13, Joyce having refused 
	to kneel with other members of the family praying at her bedside. After her 
	death he continued to drink heavily, and conditions at home grew quite 
	appalling. He scraped a living reviewing books, teaching and singing &#8212; he 
	was an accomplished tenor, and won the bronze medal in the 1904 Feis 
	Ceoil.On 7 January 1904, he attempted to publish A Portrait of the Artist as 
	a Young Man, an essay-story dealing with aesthetics, only to have it 
	rejected by the free-thinking magazine Dana. He decided, on his 
	twenty-second birthday, to revise the story and turn it into a novel he 
	planned to call Stephen Hero. However, he never published this novel in this 
	original name. This was the same year he met Nora Barnacle, a young woman 
	from Galway city who was working as a chambermaid at Finn's Hotel in Dublin. 
	On 16 June 1904, they went on their first date, an event which would be 
	commemorated by providing the date for the action of Ulysses. Joyce remained 
	in Dublin for some time longer, drinking heavily. After one of his alcoholic 
	binges, he got into a fight over a misunderstanding with a man in St. 
	Stephen's Green; he was picked up and dusted off by a minor acquaintance of 
	his father, Alfred H. Hunter, who brought him into his home to tend to his 
	injuries. Hunter was rumored to be Jewish and to have an unfaithful wife, 
	and would serve as one of the models for Leopold Bloom, the main protagonist 
	of Ulysses. He took up with medical student Oliver St John Gogarty, who 
	formed the basis for the character Buck Mulligan in Ulysses. After staying 
	in Gogarty's Martello Tower for 6 nights he left in the middle of the night 
	following an altercation which involved Gogarty shooting a pistol at some 
	pans hanging directly over Joyce's bed. He walked all the way back to Dublin 
	to stay with relatives for the night, and sent a friend to the tower the 
	next day to pack his possessions into his trunk. Shortly thereafter he 
	eloped to the continent with Nora. <br>

		<p><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">1904&#8211;1920: Trieste and Zurich</font><br>
		<br></b><font size="2">Joyce and Nora went into self-imposed exile, moving first 
	to Zürich, where he had supposedly acquired a post teaching English at the 
	Berlitz Language School through an agent in England. It turned out that the 
	English agent had been swindled, but the director of the school sent him on 
	to Trieste, which was part of Austria-Hungary until World War I (today part 
	of Italy). Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the 
	help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz school, he 
	finally secured a teaching position in Pula, then also part of 
	Austria-Hungary (today part of Croatia). He stayed there, teaching English 
	mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pula base, from 
	October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians &#8212; having discovered an 
	espionage ring in the city &#8212; expelled all aliens. With Artifoni's help, he 
	moved back to the city of Trieste and began teaching English there. He would 
	remain in Trieste for most of the next 10 years.</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Later 
	that year Nora gave birth to their first child, Giorgio. Joyce then managed 
	to talk his brother, Stanislaus, into joining him in Trieste, and secured 
	him a position teaching at the school. Ostensibly his reasons were for his 
	company and offering his brother a much more interesting life than the 
	simple clerking job he had back in Dublin, but in truth, he hoped to augment 
	his family's meagre income with his brother's earnings. Stanislaus and James 
	had strained relations the entire time they lived together in Trieste, with 
	most arguments centering on James' frivolity with money and drinking 
	habits.With chronic wanderlust much of his early life, Joyce became 
	frustrated with life in Trieste and moved to Rome in late 1906, having 
	secured a position working in a bank in the city. He intensely disliked 
	Rome, however, and ended up moving back to Trieste in early 1907. His 
	daughter Lucia was born in the summer of the same year. Joyce returned to 
	Dublin in the summer of 1909 with Giorgio, in order to visit his father and 
	work on getting Dubliners published. He visited Nora's family in Galway, 
	meeting them for the first time (a successful visit, to his relief). When 
	preparing to return to Trieste he decided to bring one of his sisters, Eva, 
	back to Trieste with him in order to help Nora look after the home. He would 
	spend only a month back in Trieste before again heading back to Dublin, this 
	time as a representative of some cinema owners in order to set up a regular 
	cinema in Dublin. The venture was successful (but would quickly fall apart 
	in his absence), and he returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another 
	sister in tow, Eileen. While Eva became very homesick for Dublin and 
	returned a few years later, Eileen spent the rest of her life on the 
	continent, eventually marrying Czech bank cashier Franti&#353;ek Schaurek. Joyce 
	returned to Dublin briefly in the summer of 1912 during his years-long fight 
	with his Dublin publisher, George Roberts, over the publication of 
	Dubliners. His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return he wrote the 
	poem &quot;Gas from a Burner&quot; as a thinly veiled invective against Roberts. It 
	was his last trip to Ireland, and he never again came closer to Dublin than 
	London, despite the many pleas of his father and invitations from fellow 
	Irish writer William Butler Yeats. Joyce came up with many money-making 
	schemes during this period of his life, such as his attempt to become a 
	cinema magnate back in Dublin, as well as a frequently discussed but 
	ultimately abandoned plan to import Irish tweeds into Trieste. His expert 
	borrowing skills saved him from indigence. His income was made up partially 
	from his position at the Berlitz school and from taking on private students. 
	Many of his acquaintances through meeting these private students proved 
	invaluable allies when he faced problems getting out of Austria-Hungary and 
	into Switzerland in 1915. One of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, 
	better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo; they met in 1907 and became 
	lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin, 
	and became the primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about 
	the Jewish faith included in Ulysses came from Schmitz in response to 
	Joyce's queries. Joyce would spend most of the rest of his life on the 
	Continent. It was in Trieste that he first began to be plagued by major eye 
	problems, which would result in over a dozen surgeries before his death. In 
	1915, when Joyce moved to Zürich in order to avoid the complexities (as a 
	British subject) of living in Austria-Hungary during World War I, he met one 
	of his most enduring and important friends, Frank Budgen, whose opinion 
	Joyce constantly sought through the writing of Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. 
	It was also here where Ezra Pound brought him to the attention of English 
	feminist and publisher Harriet Shaw Weaver, who would become Joyce's patron, 
	providing him thousands of pounds over the next 25 years and relieving him 
	of the burden of teaching in order to focus on his writing. After the war he 
	returned to Trieste briefly, but found the city had changed, and his 
	relations with his brother (who had been interned in an Austrian prison camp 
	for most of the war due to his pro-Italian politics) were more strained than 
	ever. Joyce headed to Paris in 1920 at an invitation from Ezra Pound, 
	supposedly for a week, but he ended up living there for the next twenty 
	years. <br>

		<p><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">1920&#8211;1941: Paris and Zurich<br>
		<br></font></b><font size="2">During this era, Joyce traveled frequently to 
	Switzerland for eye surgeries and treatments for Lucia, who, according to 
	the Joyce estate, suffered from schizophrenia. Lucia was even analyzed by 
	Carl Jung at the time, who was of the opinion that her father had 
	schizophrenia after reading Ulysses. Jung noted that she and her father were 
	two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that he was diving and 
	she was falling. In-depth knowledge of Joyce's relationship with his 
	schizophrenic daughter is scant, because the current heir of the Joyce 
	estate, Stephen Joyce, burned thousands of letters between Lucia and her 
	father that he received upon Lucia's death in 1982. Stephen Joyce stated in 
	a letter to the editor of the New York Times that &quot;Regarding the destroyed 
	correspondence, these were all personal letters from Lucia to us. They were 
	written many years after both Nonno and Nonna [i.e. Joyce and Nora 
	Barnacle..] died and did not refer to them. Also destroyed were some 
	postcards and one telegram from Samuel Beckett to Lucia. This was done at 
	Sam's written request.&quot;</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Paris, 
	Maria and Eugene Jolas nursed Joyce during his long years of writing 
	Finnegans Wake. Were it not for their unwavering support (along with Harriet 
	Shaw Weaver's constant financial support), there is a good possibility that 
	his books might never have been finished or published. In their now 
	legendary literary magazine &quot;transition,&quot; the Jolases published serially 
	various sections of Joyce's novel under the title Work in Progress. He 
	returned to Zurich in late 1940, fleeing the Nazi occupation of France. On 
	11 January 1941, he underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer. While at first 
	improved, he relapsed the following day, and despite several transfusions, 
	fell into a coma. He awoke at 2 a.m. on 13 January 1941, and asked for a 
	nurse to call his wife and son before losing consciousness again. They were 
	still en route when he died 15 minutes later. He is buried in the Fluntern 
	Cemetery within earshot of the lions in the Zurich zoo. Although two senior 
	Irish diplomats were in Switzerland at the time, neither attended Joyce's 
	funeral, and the Irish government subsequently declined Nora's offer to 
	permit the repatriation of Joyce's remains. Nora, whom Joyce had finally 
	married in London in 1931, survived him by 10 years. She is buried now by 
	his side, as is their son Giorgio, who died in 1976. Ellmann reports that 
	when the arrangements for Joyce's burial were being made, a Catholic priest 
	tried to convince Nora that there should be a funeral Mass. Ever loyal, she 
	replied, 'I couldn't do that to him'. Swiss tenor Max Meili sang Addio 
	terra, addio cielo from Monteverdi's L'Orfeo at the funeral service. <br>

	his family had long been established and where he lived nearly all his life. 
	The history and legends of the South, including his own family, furnish the 
	material for most of his books and all of the better ones. Encouraged by 
	Sherwood Anderson (1876&#8212;1941), a leading naturalistic writer famous for his 
	stories of Winesburg, Ohio, he began writing fiction while working as a 
	journalist in New Orleans. His first two novels were based respectively on 
	his experiences as a trainee pilot in the Royal (British) Air Force and 
	bohemian life in contemporary New Orleans.<br>Moving back to his home town of Oxford (Jefferson in the novels), Faulkner 
	began to write the remarkable novels that presented a fictional illustration 
	of the doom-laden history of the South, containing plenty of tragedy and 
	horror but also much humour. Though his literary career was long and 
	productive, Faulkner's fame rests chiefly on the novels written in the late 
	1920s and early 1930s, persistently experimental in style and earning him 
	recognition as a leader of Modernism (a slightly later development in North 
	America). <i>The Sound and the Fury</i> (1929) has several narrators, one of them 
	mentally disabled. <i>As I Lay Dying</i> (1930) brilliantly employs the 
	stream-of-consciousness technique. <i>Light in August</i> (1932), the immense and 
	complex A<i>bsalom, Absalom! </i>(1936) and <i>Intruder in the Dust</i> (1940) 
	consolidated his reputation. Faulkner also wrote short stories, including 
	the classic 'The Bear' which is an episode in <i>Go Down, Moses</i> (1942), and two 
	volumes of poetry. By the time he won the Nobel Prize in 1949, his best work 
	was some years behind him, though his last novel, <i>The Reivers</i> (1962) is 
	genial and entertaining.<br>

	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">William Faulkner (born William Cuthbert 
	Falkner), (September 25, 1897&#8211;July 6, 1962) was an American author. One of 
	the most influential writers of the twentieth century, he was awarded the 
	1949 Nobel Prize in Literature. His reputation is based on his novels, 
	novellas, and short stories. However, he was also a published poet and an 
	occasional screenwriter. Most of Faulkner's works are set in his native 
	state of Mississippi, and he is considered one of the most important 
	&quot;Southern writers,&quot; along with Mark Twain, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, 
	and Tennessee Williams. While his work was published regularly starting in 
	the mid 1920s, he was relatively unknown before receiving the Nobel Prize. 
	He is now deemed among the greatest American writers of all time.Faulkner 
	was born William Cuthbert Falkner in New Albany, Mississippi. He was raised 
	in and heavily influenced by the state of Mississippi, as well as by the 
	history and culture of the South as a whole. When he was four years old, his 
	entire family moved to the nearby town of Oxford, where he lived on and off 
	for the rest of his life. Oxford is the model for the town of &quot;Jefferson&quot; in 
	his fiction, and Lafayette County, Mississippi which contains the town of 
	Oxford, the model for his fictional Yoknapatawpha County. Faulkner's 
	great-grandfather, William Clark Falkner, was an important figure in 
	northern Mississippi who served as a colonel in the Confederate Army, 
	founded a railroad, and gave his name to the town of Falkner in nearby 
	Tippah County. He also wrote several novels and other works, establishing a 
	literary tradition in the family. Colonel Falkner served as the model for 
	Colonel John Sartoris in his great-grandson's writing. The older Falkner was 
	greatly influenced by the history of his family and the region in which they 
	lived. Mississippi marked his sense of humor, his sense of the tragic 
	position of blacks and whites, his characterization of Southern characters 
	and timeless themes, including fiercely intelligent people dwelling behind 
	the façades of good old boys and simpletons. After being snubbed by the 
	United States Army because of his height, (he was 5' 5½&quot;), Faulkner first 
	joined the Canadian and then the British Royal Air Force, yet did not see 
	any World War I wartime action. The definitive reason for Faulkner's change 
	in the spelling of his last name is still unknown. Faulkner himself may have 
	made the change in 1918 upon joining the Air Force or, according to one 
	story, that a careless typesetter made an error. When the misprint appeared 
	on the title page of Faulkner's first book and the author was asked about 
	it, he supposedly replied, &quot;Either way suits me.&quot;Although Faulkner is 
	heavily identified with Mississippi, he was living in New Orleans in 1925 
	when he wrote his first novel, Soldiers' Pay, after being influenced by 
	Sherwood Anderson to try fiction. The small house at 624 Pirate's Alley, 
	just around the corner from St. Louis Cathedral, is now the premises of 
	Faulkner House Books, and also serves as the headquarters of the Pirate's 
	Alley Faulkner Society. Faulkner served as Writer-in-Residence at the 
	University of Virginia from 1957 until his death at Wright's Sanitorium in 
	Byhalia, Mississippi of a heart attack at the age of 64. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the early 1940s, Howard Hawks invited 
	Faulkner to come to Hollywood to become a screenwriter for the films Hawks 
	was directing. Faulkner happily accepted because he badly needed the money, 
	and Hollywood paid well. Thus Faulkner contributed to the scripts for the 
	films Hawks made from Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep and Ernest 
	Hemingway's To Have and Have Not. Faulkner became good friends with director 
	Howard Hawks, the screenwriter A.I. Bezzerides, and the actors Humphrey 
	Bogart and Lauren Bacall. An apocryphal story regarding Faulkner during his 
	Hollywood years found him with a case of writer's block at the studio. He 
	told Hawks he was having a hard time concentrating and would like to write 
	at home. Hawks was agreeable, and Faulkner left. Several days passed, with 
	no word from the writer. Hawks telephoned Faulkner's hotel and found that 
	Faulkner had checked out several days earlier. It seems Faulkner had spoken 
	quite literally, and had returned home to Mississippi to finish the 
	screenplay. Faulkner's Hollywood experience is fictionalized in the Joel and 
	Ethan Coen 1991 film Barton Fink, whose supporting character, W.P. Mayhew, 
	is intended as a composite of Faulkner and his Lost Generation peer, F. 
	Scott Fitzgerald.<br>
	Faulkner married Estelle Oldham in June 1929 at College Hill Presbyterian 
	Church just outside of Oxford, Mississippi. They honeymooned on the 
	Mississippi Gulf Coast at Pascagoula, then returned to Oxford, first living 
	with relatives while they searched for a home of their own to purchase. In 
	1930 Faulkner purchased the antebellum home Rowan Oak, known at that time as 
	&quot;The Bailey Place&quot;. He and his family lived there until his daughter Jill, 
	after her mother's death, sold the property to the University of Mississippi 
	in 1972. The house and furnishings are maintained much as they were in 
	Faulkner's day. Faulkner's scribblings are still preserved on the wall 
	there, including the day-by-day outline covering an entire week that he 
	wrote out on the walls of his small study to help him keep track of the plot 
	twists in the novel A Fable. Faulkner accomplished what he did despite a 
	lifelong serious drinking problem. As he stated on several occasions, and as 
	was witnessed by members of his family, the press, and friends at various 
	periods over the course of his career, he did not drink while writing, nor 
	did he believe that alcohol helped to fuel the creative process. It is now 
	widely believed that Faulkner used alcohol as an &quot;escape valve&quot; from the 
	day-to-day pressures of his regular life, including his financial straits, 
	rather than the more romantic vision of a brilliant writer who needed 
	alcohol to pursue his craft[citation needed]. Faulkner is known to have had 
	two extramarital affairs. One was with Howard Hawks's secretary and 
	script-girl, Meta Carpenter. The other, lasting from 1949 to 1953, was with 
	a young writer, Joan Williams, who considered him her mentor. She made her 
	relationship with Faulkner the subject of her 1971 novel The Wintering. <br>
	From the early 1920s to the outbreak of WWII, when Faulkner left for 
	Hollywood, he published 13 novels and numerous short stories, the body of 
	work that grounds his reputation and for which he was awarded Nobel Prize at 
	the early age of 52. This prodigious output, mainly driven by an obscure 
	writer's need for money, includes his most celebrated novels such as The 
	Sound and the Fury (1929), As I Lay Dying (1930), Light in August (1932), 
	and Absalom, Absalom! (1936). Faulkner was also a prolific writer of short 
	stories. His first short story collection, These 13 (1932), includes many of 
	his most acclaimed (and most frequently anthologized) stories, including &quot;A 
	Rose for Emily,&quot; &quot;Red Leaves&quot;, &quot;That Evening Sun,&quot; and &quot;Dry September.&quot; 
	Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in Yoknapatawpha 
	County&#8212;based on, and nearly geographically identical to, Lafayette County, 
	of which his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi is the county seat. Three 
	novels, &quot;The Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Town&quot; and &quot;The Mansion&quot;, known collectively as 
	the &quot;Snopes Trilogy&quot; document the town of Jefferson and its environs as an 
	extended family headed by Flem Snopes insinuates itself into the lives and 
	psyches of the general populace. It is a stage wherein rapaciousness and 
	decay come to the fore in a world where such realities were always present, 
	but never so compartmentalized and well defined; their sources never so 
	easily identifiable. Additional works include Sanctuary (1931), a 
	sensationalist &quot;pulp fiction&quot;-styled novel, characterized by André Malraux 
	as &quot;the intrusion of Greek tragedy into the detective story.&quot; Its themes of 
	evil and corruption, bearing Southern Gothic tones, resonate to this day. 
	Requiem for a Nun (1951), a play/novel sequel to Sanctuary, is the only play 
	that Faulkner published, except for his The Marionettes, which he 
	essentially self-published -- in a few hand-written copies -- as a young 
	man. Faulkner is known for an experimental style with meticulous attention 
	to diction and cadence. In contrast to the minimalist understatement of his 
	peer Ernest Hemingway, Faulkner made frequent use of &quot;stream of 
	consciousness&quot; in his writing, and wrote often highly emotional, subtle, 
	cerebral, complex, and sometimes Gothic or grotesque stories of a wide 
	variety of characters&#8212;ranging from former slaves or descendents of slaves, 
	to poor white, agrarian, or working-class Southerners, to Southern 
	aristocrats. In an interview with The Paris Review in 1956, Faulkner 
	remarked, &quot;Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested 
	in technique. There is no mechanical way to get the writing done, no 
	shortcut. The young writer would be a fool to follow a theory. Teach 
	yourself by your own mistakes; people learn only by error. The good artist 
	believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice. He has supreme 
	vanity. No matter how much he admires the old writer, he wants to beat him&quot;. 
	Another esteemed Southern writer, Flannery O'Connor, stated that, &quot;The 
	presence alone of Faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the 
	writer can and cannot permit himself to do. Nobody wants his mule and wagon 
	stalled on the same track the Dixie Limited is roaring down.&quot; Faulkner also 
	wrote two volumes of poetry which were published in small printings, The 
	Marble Faun (1924) and A Green Bough (1933), and a collection of 
	crime-fiction short stories, Knight's Gambit. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Faulkner received the 1949 Nobel Prize for 
	Literature for &quot;his powerful and artistically unique contribution to the 
	modern American novel&quot;. He donated a portion of his Nobel winnings &quot;to 
	establish a fund to support and encourage new fiction writers&quot;, eventually 
	resulting in the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. He donated another portion 
	to a local Oxford bank to establish an account to provide scholarship funds 
	to help educate African-American education majors at nearby Rust College in 
	Holly Springs, Mississippi. Faulkner won two Pulitzer Prizes for what are 
	considered as his &quot;minor&quot; novels: his 1954 novel A Fable, which took the 
	Pulitzer in 1955, and the 1962 novel, The Reivers, which was posthumously 
	awarded the Pulitzer in 1963. He also won two National Book Awards, first 
	for his Collected Stories in 1951 and once again for his novel A Fable in 
	1955. In 1946, Faulkner was one of three finalists for the first Ellery 
	Queen Mystery Magazine Award. He came in second to Manly Wade Wellman.</font></td>

	<i><font size="1">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>
&nbsp;</font></i></font><p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">(Adeline) 
	Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882 &#8211; 28 March 1941) was an English 
	novelist and essayist, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary 
	figures of the twentieth century. During the interwar period, Woolf was a 
	significant figure in London literary society and a member of the Bloomsbury 
	Group. Her most famous works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the 
	Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928), and the book-length essay A Room of 
	One's Own (1929) with its famous dictum, &quot;a woman must have money and a room 
	of her own if she is to write fiction.&quot; <br>
	Born Adeline Virginia Stephen in London to Sir Leslie Stephen, considered 
	the father of the Bloomsbury Group, and Julia Prinsep Stephen (born Jackson) 
	(1846&#8211;1895), she was educated by her parents in their literate and 
	well-connected household at 22 Hyde Park Gate, Kensington. Virginia's 
	parents had each been married previously, and their spouses had died. 
	Consequently, the household contained the children of three marriages: 
	Julia's children with her first husband Herbert Duckworth: George Duckworth 
	(1868&#8211;1934); Stella Duckworth (1869&#8211;1897); and Gerald Duckworth (1870&#8211;1937). 
	Laura Makepeace Stephen (1870&#8211;1945), Leslie's daughter with Minny Thackeray, 
	who was declared mentally disabled and lived with them until she was 
	institutionalised in 1891 to the end of her life; and Leslie and Julia's 
	children: Vanessa Stephen (1879&#8211;1961); Thoby Stephen (1880&#8211;1906); Virginia; 
	and Adrian Stephen (1883&#8211;1948). Sir Leslie Stephen's eminence as an editor, 
	critic, and biographer, and his connection to William Thackeray (he was the 
	widower of Thackeray's eldest daughter) meant that Woolf was raised in an 
	environment filled with the influences of Victorian literary society. Henry 
	James, George Eliot, George Henry Lewes, Julia Margaret Cameron (an aunt of 
	Julia Stephen), and James Russell Lowell, who was made Virginia's godfather, 
	were among the visitors to the house. Julia Stephen was equally well 
	connected. Descended from an attendant of Marie Antoinette, she came from a 
	family of renowned beauties who left their mark on Victorian society as 
	models for Pre-Raphaelite artists and early photographers. Supplementing 
	these influences was the immense library at 22 Hyde Park Gate, from which 
	Virginia (unlike her brothers, who were formally educated) was taught the 
	classics and English literature. According to her memoirs her most vivid 
	childhood memories, however, were not of London but of St Ives in Cornwall, 
	where the family spent every summer until 1895. The family stayed in their 
	home called the Talland House, which looked out over the Porthminster Bay. 
	Memories of the family holidays and impressions of the landscape, especially 
	the Godrevy Lighthouse, informed the fiction she wrote in later years, 
	notably To the Lighthouse. She also based the summer home in Scotland after 
	the Talland House and the Ramsay family after her own family. The sudden 
	death of her mother in 1895, when Virginia was 13, and that of her half 
	sister Stella two years later, led to the first of Virginia's several 
	nervous breakdowns. The death of her father in 1904 provoked her most 
	alarming collapse and she was briefly institutionalized. Her breakdowns and 
	subsequent recurring depressive periods, modern scholars have claimed, were 
	also induced by the sexual abuse she and Vanessa were subject to by their 
	half-brothers George and Gerald (which Woolf recalls in her autobiographical 
	essays A Sketch of the Past and 22 Hyde Park Gate). Throughout her life, 
	Woolf was plagued by drastic mood swings.</font> <font size="2">Though these 
	recurring mental breakdowns greatly affected her social functioning, her 
	literary abilities remained intact. Modern diagnostic techniques have led to 
	a posthumous diagnosis of bipolar disorder, an illness which coloured her 
	work, relationships, and life, and eventually led to her suicide. Following 
	the death of her father in 1904 and her second serious nervous breakdown, 
	Virginia, Vanessa, and Adrian sold 22 Hyde Park Gate, and bought a house at 
	46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury. Following studies at King's College London, 
	Woolf came to know Lytton Strachey, Clive Bell, Saxon Sydney-Turner, Duncan 
	Grant, and Leonard Woolf, who together formed the nucleus of the 
	intellectual circle known as the Bloomsbury Group which came to notorious 
	fame in 1910 with the Dreadnought hoax Virginia Woolf participated in, 
	dressed as a male Abyssinian royalty. Virginia Stephen married writer 
	Leonard Woolf in 1912, referring to him during their engagement as a 
	&quot;penniless Jew.&quot; The couple shared a close bond, and in 1937 Woolf wrote in 
	her diary &quot;Love-making &#8212; after 25 years can&#8217;t be attained by my unattractive 
	countenance ... you see it is enormous pleasure being wanted, a pleasure 
	that I have never felt.&quot; They also collaborated professionally, in 1917 
	founding the Hogarth Press, which subsequently published most of Woolf's 
	work. The ethos of Bloomsbury discouraged sexual exclusivity, and in 1922, 
	Woolf met Vita Sackville-West. After a tentative start, they began a 
	relationship that lasted through most of the 1920s. In 1928, Woolf presented 
	Sackville-West with Orlando, a fantastical biography in which the eponymous 
	hero's life spans three centuries and both genders. It has been called by 
	Nigel Nicolson, Vita Sackville-West's son, &quot;the longest and most charming 
	love letter in literature.&quot; After their affair ended, the two women remained 
	friends until Woolf's death. After completing the manuscript of her last 
	(posthumously published) novel Between the Acts, Woolf fell victim to a 
	depression similar to that which she had earlier experienced. The war, the 
	Luftwaffe's destruction of her London homes, as well as the cool reception 
	given to her biography of her late friend Roger Fry, worsened her condition 
	until she was unable to work.On 28 March 1941, after having a nervous 
	breakdown, Woolf drowned herself by weighing her pockets with stones and 
	walking into the River Ouse near her home. Her body was not found until 
	April 18. Her husband buried her cremated remains under a tree in the garden 
	of their house in Rodmell, Sussex. In her last note to her husband she 
	wrote: </font></font></p>
	<p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I feel certain that I am going mad 
	again. I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times. And I 
	shan't recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can't concentrate. 
	So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the 
	greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone 
	could be. I don't think two people could have been happier 'til this 
	terrible disease came. I can't fight any longer. I know that I am spoiling 
	your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I 
	can't even write this properly. I can't read. What I want to say is I owe 
	all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me 
	and incredibly good. I want to say that &#8212; everybody knows it. If anybody 
	could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but 
	the certainty of your goodness. I can't go on spoiling your life any longer. 
	I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been. &quot; </font>
	</i></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Woolf began writing professionally in 1905, 
	initially for the Times Literary Supplement with a journalistic piece about 
	Haworth, home of the Brontë family.[5] Her first novel, The Voyage Out, was 
	published in 1915 by her half-brother's imprint, Gerald Duckworth and 
	Company Ltd. This novel was originally entitled Melymbrosia, but Woolf 
	repeatedly changed the draft. An earlier version of The Voyage Out has been 
	reconstructed by Woolf scholar Louise DeSalvo and is now available to the 
	public under the intended title. DeSalvo argues that many of the changes 
	Woolf made in the text were in response to changes in her own life.Woolf 
	went on to publish novels and essays as a public intellectual to both 
	critical and popular success. Much of her work was self-published through 
	the Hogarth Press. She has been hailed as one of the greatest novelists of 
	the twentieth century and one of the foremost Modernists, though she 
	disdained some artists in this category. Woolf is considered one of the 
	greatest innovators in the English language. In her works she experimented 
	with stream-of-consciousness and the underlying psychological as well as 
	emotional motives of characters. Woolf's reputation declined sharply after 
	World War II, but her eminence was re-established with the surge of Feminist 
	criticism in the 1970s. After a few more ideologically based altercations, 
	not least caused by claims that Woolf was anti-Semitic and a snob, it seems 
	that a critical consensus has been reached regarding her stature as a 
	novelist. Her work was criticised for epitomizing the narrow world of the 
	upper-middle class English intelligentsia. Some critics judged it to be 
	lacking in universality and depth, without the power to communicate anything 
	of emotional or ethical relevance to the disillusioned common reader, weary 
	of the 1920s aesthetes. She was also criticized by some as an anti-Semite, 
	despite her marriage to a Jewish man. She wrote in her diary, &quot;I do not like 
	the Jewish voice; I do not like the Jewish laugh.&quot; However, in a 1930 letter 
	to Ethel Smyth quoted in Nigel Nicolson's biography,Virginia Woolf, she 
	recollects her boasts of Leonard's Jewishness confirming her snobbish 
	tendencies, &quot;How I hated marrying a Jew- What a snob I was, for they have 
	immense vitality.&quot;Virginia Woolf's peculiarities as a fiction writer have 
	tended to obscure her central strength: Woolf is arguably the major lyrical 
	novelist in the English language. Her novels are highly experimental: a 
	narrative, frequently uneventful and commonplace, is refracted&#8212;and sometimes 
	almost dissolved&#8212;in the characters' receptive consciousness. Intense 
	lyricism and stylistic virtuosity fuse to create a world overabundant with 
	auditory and visual impressions. The intensity of Virginia Woolf's poetic 
	vision elevates the ordinary, sometimes banal settings - often wartime 
	environments - of most of her novels. For example, Mrs Dalloway (1925) 
	centres on the efforts of Clarissa Dalloway, a middle-aged society woman, to 
	organize a party, even as her life is paralleled with that of Septimus 
	Warren Smith, a working-class veteran who has returned from the First World 
	War bearing deep psychological scars. To the Lighthouse (1927) is set on two 
	days ten years apart. The plot centers around the Ramsay family's 
	anticipation of and reflection upon a visit to a lighthouse and the 
	connected familial tensions. One of the primary themes of the novel is the 
	struggle in the creative process that beset painter Lily Briscoe while she 
	struggles to paint in the midst of the family drama. The novel is also a 
	meditation upon the lives of a nation's inhabitants in the midst of war, and 
	of the people left behind. The Waves (1931) presents a group of six friends 
	whose reflections, which are closer to recitatives than to interior 
	monologues proper, create a wave-like atmosphere that is more akin to a 
	prose poem than to a plot-centered novel. Her last work, Between the Acts 
	(1941) sums up and magnifies Woolf's chief preoccupations: the 
	transformation of life through art, sexual ambivalence, and meditation on 
	the themes of flux of time and life, presented simultaneously as corrosion 
	and rejuvenation - all set in a highly imaginative and symbolic narrative 
	encompassing almost all of English history. While nowhere near a simple 
	recapitulation of the coterie's ideals, Woolf's work can be understood as 
	consistently in dialogue with Bloomsbury, particularly its tendency 
	(informed by G.E. Moore, among others) towards doctrinaire rationalism.</font></td>

	</b>Technically, <b>E. M. Forster</b> (1879-1970) was a more traditional novelist. 
	The novel, he famously said, 'tells a story'. He established his reputation 
	with <i>Where Angels Fear to Tread</i> (1905), <i>The Longest Journey</i> 
	(1907), <i>A Room With a View</i> (1907) and, conclusively, with <i>Howard's 
	End</i> (1910), a brilliant encapsulation of contemporary middle-class 
	mores, which ends with Forster's famous motto, 'Only Connect ... ', 
	signifying his commitment to sympathetic relationships as the foundation of 
	a civilized existence. During the rest of his life he wrote only two more 
	novels: Maurice (1971), celebrating a homosexual relationship, which he 
	declined to publish during his lifetime, and his most famous, <i>A Passage 
	to India </i>(1924), the fruit of two visits to the subcontinent that 
	cemented his hatred of imperialism. Sexual deviance, then highly improper, 
	no doubt contributed to Forster's humane liberalism (he was the first 
	president of the National Council for Civil Liberties). Besides his few but 
	intensely evocative novels, he wrote short stories and fine and accessible 
	commentaries on English literature, notably in <i>Aspects of the Novel</i> 
	(1927).</font></td>

	</b>(1883-1930) with Bloomsbury were remote, though when living in London he 
	became friendly with several of the group, including the critic David 
	Garnett, the new Zealand short-story writer Katherine Mansfield and the 
	philosopher Bertrand Russell. He was a born &#8212; and prolific - writer, of 
	poetry, criticism, travel, plays, essays and short stories, as well as 
	novels. His first novel, <i>The White Peacock</i> (1911), was published 
	thanks to Ford Madox Ford, who had been impressed by his early poetry. <i>
	Sons and Lovers</i> (1914), based on his childhood, exemplified the 
	intensity of Lawrence's passions, but <i>The Rainbow</i> (1915), one of his 
	best, ran into trouble through alleged obscenity and for some time he was 
	unable to find a publisher for <i>Women in Love </i>(privately printed 
	1920).<br>
	In 1912, Lawrence ran off with Frieda, the German wife of a Nottingham 
	professor, and from 1919 they lived a peripatetic life. Australia provided 
	the setting for Kangaroo (1923) and Mexico for <i>The Plumed Serpent</i> 
	(1926). Although the real subject of his last novel is the destructive 
	effects of industrialism on human consciousness, Lawrence's frank treatment 
	of sex prevented publication of <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> until 30 
	years after his death from tuberculosis at the age of 44.</font></td>

	<b>Poetry of the modern period, as one literary historian put it, 'has not 
	escaped the atmosphere of controversy.' Few groups of poets have endured 
	such censure as the English 'Georgians' (1920s), seen as artificial and 
	shallow. French symbolism remained an important influence, especially in 
	Germany, where it stimulated one of the finest lyric poets of the century, 
	Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) and the Austrian Hugo von Hofmannsthal 
	(1874-1929), while in France Surrealism, a term coined by the 'evangelist of 
	Modernism', Guillaume Apollinaire (1880-1918), aimed, under the vigorous 
	leadership of Andre Breton (1896-1966), to overturn all accepted doctrine in 
	poetry and the arts. Other influential movements included German 
	Expressionism and Italian Futurism. The last note of English Romanticism was 
	sounded by A. E. Housman (1859-1936), and a powerful influence was 
	exercised, not for the best, by the highly original work of Gerard Manley 
	Hopkins (1844-89), almost unknown before 1918. The exotic appeal of the East 
	surfaced in James Elroy Flecker (1884-1915); Walter de la Mare (1973-1956), 
	champion anthologist, wrote technically distinguished lyrics untouched by 
	modern fashion. In short, variety, like controversy, was not lacking. 
	Nevertheless, poetry in English in the first half of the 20th century was 
	largely dominated by an Irishman, Yeats, and an American, Eliot.<br>

	WAR POETS<br>

	</b><font size="2"><br>
	The First World War had a dramatic effect on literature. All the great works 
	of Modernism, if not actually concerned with the War, are affected by it. 
	The term 'war poets' signifies a disparate group in whose work the War plays 
	the major part, often because, sadly, the poet himself did not survive it.<br>
	Rupert Brooke, a young Georgian, was probably the most popular with - 
	civilian -readers, though not with critics. He died early (April 1915), 
	before the hideous experience of the trenches had obliterated the curiously 
	exalted spirit in which, at the outset, war was regarded as a liberating, 
	cleansing experience.Julian Grenfell (fatally wounded May 1915) also died 
	before disillusion led Edmund Blunden (a survivor) to the realisation that 
	only 'the War had won, and would go on winning'. Other survivors included 
	Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, a major though idiosyncratic writer, and 
	Ivor Gurney. Among non-survivors were Edward Thomas, Isaac Rosenberg and

	</font>
	</b><font size="2">Born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, and educated at Harvard, where 
	he wrote some of the satirical poems in <i>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</i> 
	(1917), <b>T(homas) S(tearns) Eliot</b> (1888-1965) left the U.S.A. in 1914 and 
	settled in London, eventually becoming an influential publisher at Faber and 
	Faber. Like many others, he was encouraged by Ezra Pound, to whom <i>The Waste 
	Land </i>(1922) is dedicated. Among other important influences were Dante, 
	the Elizabethans Jacobeans, especially Donne, and Christian mystics (Eliot 
	joined the Anglican Church in 1927). The Waste Land, the most influential 
	(though not the most read) poem of the century, is a pessimistic view of the 
	desolation of European civilization after the war. In five books, mainly in 
	free verse, it is uncompromisingly intellectual, full of complex and learned 
	references which are not much clarified by Eliot's notes (for further 
	elucidation of a transcription from the Sanskrit<i> Upanishads</i>, the reader is 
	advised to consult a scholarly work in German). Eliot's poetic drama. 
	'Sweeney Agonistes' (published in the 1936 Collected Poems, but written ten 
	years earlier) turned him towards the theatre. His most successful verse 
	play, often revived, was <i>Murder in the Cathedral</i> (1935), about the murder of 
	Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral and first staged there. <i>The Cocktail 
	Party </i>(1950) was also a popular and critical success. The work that some 
	critics think challenges <i>The Waste Land</i> as Eliot's masterpiece is the 
	sequence Four Quartets (1943), 'Burnt Norton', 'East Coker', &quot;The Dry 
	Salvages' and 'Little Gidding'. It is suffused with Anglo-Catholic 
	mysticism, dwells on time, memory and consciousness and offers some hope of 
	reconciliation that is hardly discernible in The Waste Land. Eliot also 
	wrote several volumes of profound and original social and literary 
	criticism, not forgetting humorous verses for children about cats.</font><br>

		</font><br><i><font size="1">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>
		</font></i><br><font size="2">Thomas Stearns Eliot, OM (26 September 1888&#8211;4 January 1965), 
	was a poet, dramatist, and literary critic. He received the Nobel Prize in 
	Literature in 1948. He wrote the poems The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, 
	The Waste Land, The Hollow Men, Ash Wednesday and Four Quartets; the plays 
	Murder in the Cathedral and The Cocktail Party; and the essay &quot;Tradition and 
	the Individual Talent&quot;. Eliot was born in the United States, moved to the 
	United Kingdom in 1914 (at age 25), and became a British subject in 1927 at 
	the age of 39. Of his nationality and its role in his work, T.S. Eliot said: 
	&quot;[My poetry] wouldn&#8217;t be what it is if I&#8217;d been born in England, and it 
	wouldn&#8217;t be what it is if I&#8217;d stayed in America. It&#8217;s a combination of 
	things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from 
	America.&quot;<br>treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St. Louis; his mother, 
	born Charlotte Champe Stearns (1843&#8211;1929), wrote poems and was also a social 
	worker. Eliot was the last of six surviving children; his parents were both 
	44 years old when he was born. His four sisters were between eleven and 
	nineteen years older than he; his brother was eight years older. Known to 
	family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, 
	Thomas Stearns. From 1898 to 1905, Eliot was a day student at Smith Academy, 
	a preparatory school for Washington University. At the academy, Eliot 
	studied Latin, Greek, French, and German. Upon graduation, he could have 
	gone to Harvard University, but his parents sent him to Milton Academy (in 
	Milton, Massachusetts, near Boston) for a preparatory year. There he met 
	Scofield Thayer, who would later publish The Waste Land. He studied at 
	Harvard, where he earned a B.A., from 1906 to 1909. During this time, he 
	read Arthur Symons's The Symbolist Movement in Literature, where, by his own 
	admission, he first came across Laforgue, Rimbaud, and Verlaine. The Harvard 
	Advocate published some of his poems, and he became lifelong friends with 
	Conrad Aiken. The next year, he earned a master's degree at Harvard. In the 
	1910&#8211;1911 school year, Eliot lived in Paris, studying at the Sorbonne and 
	touring the continent. Returning to Harvard in 1911 as a doctoral student in 
	philosophy, Eliot studied the writings of F. H. Bradley, Buddhism and Indic 
	philology (learning Sanskrit and P&#257;li to read some of the religious texts). 
	He was awarded a scholarship to attend Merton College, Oxford, in 1914, and, 
	before settling there, he visited Marburg, Germany, where he planned to take 
	a summer program in philosophy. When the First World War broke out, however, 
	he went to London and then to Oxford. In a letter to Aiken late in December 
	1914, Eliot, aged 26, wrote &quot;I am very dependent upon women (I mean female 
	society)&quot; and then added a complaint that he was still a virgin. Less than 
	four months later, he was introduced by Thayer, then also at Oxford, to 
	Cambridge governess Vivienne Haigh-Wood. Eliot was not happy at Merton and 
	declined a second year there. Instead, on 26 June 1915, he married Vivienne 
	in a register office. After a short visit, alone, to the U. S. to see his 
	family, he returned to London and took a few teaching jobs such as lecturing 
	at Birkbeck College, University of London. He continued to work on his 
	dissertation and, in the spring of 1916, sent it to Harvard, which accepted 
	it. Because he did not appear in person to defend his dissertation, however, 
	he was not awarded his PhD. (In 1964, the dissertation</font> <font size="2">was published as Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F. H. 
	Bradley.) During Eliot's university career, he studied with George 
	Santayana, Irving Babbitt, Henri Bergson, C. R. Lanman, Josiah Royce, 
	Bertrand Russell, and Harold Joachim. Bertrand Russell took an interest in 
	Vivien (the spelling she preferred) while the newlyweds stayed in his flat. 
	Some scholars have suggested that Vivien and Russell had an affair , but 
	these allegations have never been confirmed. Eliot, in a private paper, 
	written in his sixties, confessed: &quot;I came to persuade myself that I was in 
	love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit 
	myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the 
	influence of Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. 
	To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of 
	mind out of which came The Waste Land.&quot;After leaving Merton, Eliot worked as 
	a schoolteacher, most notably at Highgate School where he taught the young 
	John Betjeman, and later at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe. To earn 
	extra money, he wrote book reviews and lectured at evening extension 
	courses. In 1917, he took a position at Lloyds Bank in London, where he 
	worked on foreign accounts. In August 1920, Eliot met James Joyce on a trip 
	to Paris, accompanied by Wyndham Lewis. After the meeting, Eliot said he 
	found Joyce arrogant (Joyce doubted Eliot's ability as a poet at the time), 
	but the two soon became friends with Eliot visiting Joyce whenever he was in 
	Paris. In 1925, Eliot left Lloyds to join the publishing firm Faber and 
	Gwyer (later Faber and Faber), where he remained for the rest of his career, 
	becoming a director of the firm. In 1927, Eliot took two important steps in 
	his self-definition. On June 29 he converted to Anglicanism and in November 
	he dropped his American citizenship and became a British subject. In 1928, 
	Eliot summarised his beliefs when he wrote in the preface to his book, For 
	Lancelot Andrewes that &quot;the general point of view [of the book's essays] may 
	be described as classicist in literature, royalist in politics, and anglo-catholic 
	in religion.&quot; By 1932, Eliot had been contemplating a separation from his 
	wife for some time. When Harvard University offered him the Charles Eliot 
	Norton professorship for the 1932-1933 academic year, he accepted, leaving 
	Vivien in England. Upon his return in 1933, Eliot officially separated from 
	Vivien. He avoided all but one meeting with his wife between his leaving for 
	America in 1932 and her death in 1947. (Vivien died at Northumberland House, 
	a mental hospital north of London, where she was committed in 1938, without 
	ever having been visited by Eliot, who was still her husband.) From 1946 to 
	1957, Eliot shared a flat with his friend, John Davy Hayward, who gathered 
	and archived Eliot's papers and styled himself Keeper of the Eliot Archive. 
	He also collected Eliot's pre-&quot;Prufrock&quot; verse, commercially published after 
	Eliot's death as Poems Written in Early Youth. When Eliot and Hayward 
	separated their household in 1957, Hayward retained his collection of 
	Eliot's papers, which he bequeathed to King's College, Cambridge in 1965. 
	Eliot's second marriage was happy but short. On January 10, 1957, he married 
	Esmé Valerie Fletcher, to whom he was introduced by Collin Brooks. In sharp 
	contrast to his first marriage, Eliot knew Miss Fletcher well, as she had 
	been his secretary at Faber and Faber since August 1949. Like his marriage 
	to Vivien, the wedding was kept a secret to preserve his privacy. The 
	ceremony was held in a church at 6.15 a.m. with virtually no one other than 
	his wife's parents in attendance. Valerie was 37 years younger than her 
	husband. Since Eliot's death she has dedicated her time to preserving his 
	legacy; she has edited and annotated The Letters of T. S. Eliot and a 
	facsimile of the draft of The Waste Land. <br>Eliot died of emphysema in London on January 4, 1965. For many years, he had 
	health problems owing to his heavy smoking, often being laid low with 
	bronchitis or tachycardia. His body was cremated at Golders Green 
	Crematorium and, according to Eliot's wishes, the ashes taken to St 
	Michael's Church in East Coker, the village from which Eliot's ancestors 
	emigrated to America. There, a simple wall plaque commemorates him with a 
	quote from his poem, &quot;East Coker&quot;: &quot;In my beginning is my end. In my end is 
	my beginning.&quot; On the second anniversary of his death, a large stone placed 
	on the floor of Poets' Corner in London's Westminster Abbey was dedicated to 
	Eliot. This commemoration contains his name, an indication that he had 
	received the Order of Merit, dates, and a quotation from his poem, &quot;Little 
	Gidding&quot;: &quot;the communication / Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond / the 
	language of the living.&quot; <br>&nbsp;</font></font></blockquote>

		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>1875-1896<br>
		</b>He was born René Karl Wilhelm Johann Josef Maria Rilke in Prague, 
	Bohemia (then within Austria-Hungary, now the Czech Republic). His childhood 
	and youth in Prague were sorrowful. His father, Josef Rilke (1838-1906), 
	became a railway official after an unsuccessful military career. His mother, 
	Sophie (&quot;Phia&quot;) Entz (1851-1931), came from a well-to-do Prague family, the 
	Entz-Kinzelbergers, who lived in a palace on the Herrengasse (Panská) 8, 
	where René also spent much of his early years. Despite his mother's Jewish 
	background, Rilke was raised Roman Catholic[citation needed]. The 
	relationship between Phia and her only son was encumbered by her prolonged 
	mourning for her elder daughter who was lost after only a week of life. In 
	fact, during Rilke's early years Phia acted as if she sought to recover the 
	lost girl through the boy by dressing him in girl's clothing when he was 
	young, and making him act like a girl, etc.. The parents' marriage fell 
	apart in 1884. His parents pressured the poetically and artistically gifted 
	youth into entering a military academy, which he attended from 1886 until 
	1891, when he left due to illness. From 1892 to 1895 he was tutored for the 
	university entrance exam, which he passed in 1895. In 1895 and 1896, he 
	studied literature, art history, and philosophy in Prague and Munich.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>1897-1902<br></b>In 1897 in Munich, Rainer Maria Rilke met and fell in love with the 
	widely traveled intellectual and lady of letters Lou Andreas-Salome 
	(1861-1937). (Rilke changed his first name from &quot;René&quot; to the more masculine 
	Rainer at Lou's urging.) His intense relationship with this married woman, 
	with whom he undertook two extensive trips to Russia, lasted until 1900. But 
	even after their separation, Lou continued to be Rilke's most important 
	confidante until the end of his life. Having trained from 1912 to 1913 as a 
	psychoanalyst with Sigmund Freud, she shared her knowledge of psychoanalysis 
	with Rilke. In 1898, Rilke undertook a journey lasting several weeks to 
	Italy. In 1899, he traveled with Lou and her husband, Friedrich Andreas, to 
	Moscow where he met the novelist Leo Tolstoy. Between May and August 1900, a 
	second journey to Russia, accompanied only by Lou, again took him to Moscow 
	and Saint Petersburg, where he met the family of Boris Pasternak and 
	Spiridon Drozhzhin, a peasant poet. Later, &quot;Rilke called two places his 
	home: Bohemia and Russia&quot;.In autumn 1900, Rilke stayed at the artists' 
	colony at Worpswede, where his portrait was painted by the 
	proto-expressionist Paula Modersohn-Becker (illus. above). It was here that 
	he got to know the sculptress Clara Westhoff (1878-1954), whom he married 
	the following spring. Their daughter Ruth (1901-1972) was born in December 
	1901. However, Rilke was not one for a middle-class family life; in the 
	summer of 1902, Rilke left home and traveled to Paris to write a monograph 
	on the sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840-1917). Still, the relationship between 
	Rilke and Clara Westhoff continued for the rest of his life.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>1902-1910<br></b>At first, Rilke had a difficult time in Paris, an experience that he 
	called on in the first part of his only novel, The Notebooks of Malte 
	Laurids Brigge. At the same time, his encounter with modernism was very 
	stimulating: Rilke became deeply involved in the sculpture of Rodin, and 
	then with the work of Paul Cézanne. For a time he acted as Rodin's 
	amanuensis, eventually writing a long essay on Rodin and his work. Rodin 
	taught him the value of objective observation, which led to Rilke's 
	Dinggedichten (&quot;thing-poems&quot;), a famous example of which is &quot;Der Panther&quot; 
	(&quot;The Panther&quot;). During these years, Paris increasingly became the writer's 
	main residence. The most important works of the Paris period were Neue 
	Gedichte (New Poems) (1907), Der Neuen Gedichte Anderer Teil (Another Part 
	of the New Poems) (1908), the two &quot;Requiem&quot; poems (1909), and the novel The 
	Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, started in 1904 and completed in January 
	1910.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>1910-1919<br></b>Between October 1911 and May 1912, Rilke stayed at the Castle Duino, 
	near Trieste, home of Countess Marie of Thurn and Taxis. There, in 1912, he 
	began the poem cycle called the Duino Elegies, which would remain unfinished 
	for a decade due to a long-lasting creativity crisis. The outbreak of World 
	War I surprised Rilke during a stay in Germany. He was unable to return to 
	Paris, where his property was confiscated and auctioned. He spent the 
	greater part of the war in Munich. From 1914 to 1916 he had a turbulent 
	affair with the painter Lou Albert-Lasard. Rilke was called up at the 
	beginning of 1916, and he had to undertake basic training in Vienna. 
	Influential friends interceded on his behalf, and he was transferred to the 
	War Records Office and discharged from the military on 9 June 1916. He spent 
	the subsequent time once again in Munich, interrupted by a stay on Hertha 
	Koenig's Gut Bockel in Westphalia. The traumatic experience of military 
	service, a reminder of the horrors of the military academy, almost 
	completely silenced him as a poet.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>1919-1926<br></b>On 11 June 1919, Rilke traveled from Munich to Switzerland. The outward 
	motive was an invitation to lecture in Zürich, but the real reason was the 
	wish to escape the post-war chaos and take up once again his work on the 
	Duino Elegies. The search for a suitable and affordable place to live proved 
	to be very difficult. Among other places, Rilke lived in Soglio, Locarno, 
	and Berg am Irchel. Only in the summer of 1921 was he able to find a 
	permanent residence in the Chateau de Muzot in the commune of Veyras, close 
	to Sierre in Valais. In May 1922, Rilke's patron Werner Reinhart purchased 
	the building so that Rilke could live there rent-free. In an intense 
	creative period, Rilke completed the Duino Elegies within several weeks in 
	February 1922. Before and after, he wrote both parts of the poem cycle 
	Sonnets to Orpheus containing 55 entire sonnets. Rilke afterwards called it 
	&quot;the great giving.&quot;[citation needed] Both works together constitute the high 
	points of Rilke's work. From 1923 on, Rilke increasingly had to struggle 
	with health problems that necessitated many long stays at a sanatorium in 
	Territet, near Montreux, on Lake Geneva. His long stay in Paris between 
	January and August 1925 was an attempt to escape his illness through a 
	change in location and living conditions. Despite this, numerous important 
	individual poems appeared in the years 1923-1926 (including Gong and 
	Mausoleum), as well as a comprehensive lyrical work in French. Only shortly 
	before his death was Rilke's illness diagnosed as leukemia. The poet died on 
	29 December 1926 in the Valmont Sanatorium in Switzerland, and was laid to 
	rest on 2 January 1927 in the Raron cemetery to the west of Visp. Rilke had 
	believed that his death would be from blood poisoning as the result of 
	having been pricked by a rose thorn. He chose his own epitaph as: </font>

		</i><br><b>Rilke's literary style<br></b>Rilke's work was highly influenced by his education and knowledge of 
	classic authors. Ancient gods Apollo, Hermes and hero Orpheus can be found 
	often as motifs in his poems and are depicted in new ways and original 
	interpretations (e. g. story of Eurydice, apathetic and dazed by death, not 
	even recognising her lover Orpheus, who descended to hell for her, in the 
	poem Orpheus. Eurydice. Hermes). Other characteristic figures in Rilke's 
	poems are angels, roses and a character of a poet and his creative work. 
	Rilke often worked with metaphors, metonymy and contradictions (e. g. as in 
	his epitaph, rose is represented as a symbol of sleep - rose petals remind 
	of closed eye lids, and of awakened senses - colour, scent and fragility of 
	a rose). Rilke's 1898 poem, &quot;Visions of Christ&quot; depicted Mary Magdalene as 
	the mother to Jesus' child.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Quoting Susan Haskins: </font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It was Rilke's explicit belief that Christ 
	was not divine, was entirely human, and deified only on Calvary, expressed 
	in an unpublished poem of 1893, and referred to in other poems of the same 
	period, which allowed him to portray Christ's love for Mary Magdalene, 
	though remarkable, as entirely human.&quot;<br>

	Marina Ivanovna Tsvetaeva (Marina Ivanovna Cvetaeva) (26 September/8 October 
	1892 &#8211; 31 August 1941) was a Russian poet and writer.<br>
	<br>
	Marina Tsvetaeva was born in Moscow. She was one of the most original of the 
	Russian 20th-century poets. Her work was not looked kindly upon by Stalin 
	and the Bolshevik régime; her literary rehabilitation only began in the 
	1960s. Tsvetaeva's poetry arose from her own deeply convoluted personality, 
	her eccentricity and tightly disciplined use of language. Among her themes 
	were female sexuality, and the tension in women's private emotions; she 
	bridges the mutually contradictory schools of Acmeism and symbolism. <br>
	Much of Tsvetaeva's poetry has its roots in the depths of her displaced and 
	disturbed childhood. Her father was Ivan Vladimirovich Tsvetaev, a professor 
	of art history at the University of Moscow, who later founded the Alexander 
	III Museum, which is now known as the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts. 
	Tsvetaeva's mother, Maria Alexandrovna Meyn, was Ivan's second wife, a 
	highly literate woman. She was also a volatile (and a frustrated) concert 
	pianist, with some Polish ancestry on her mother's side. (This latter fact 
	was to play on Marina's imagination, and to cause her to identify herself 
	with the Polish aristocracy.) Marina had two half-siblings, Valeria and 
	Andrei, who were the children of Ivan's deceased first wife, Varvara 
	Dmitrievna Ilovaisky (daughter of the historian Dmitry Ilovaisky). Her only 
	full sister, Anastasia, was born in 1894. Quarrels among the children were 
	frequent and occasionally violent. There was considerable tension between 
	Tsvetaeva's mother and Varvara's children, and Tsvetaeva's father maintained 
	close contact with Varvara's family. Maria favoured Anastasia over Marina. 
	Tsvetaeva's father was kind, but deeply wrapped up in his studies and 
	distant from his family. He was also still deeply in love with his first 
	wife; he would never get over her. Maria, for her part, had had a tragic 
	love affair before her marriage, from which she never recovered. Maria 
	Alexandrovna particularly disapproved of Marina's poetic inclination. She 
	wished her daughter to become a pianist and thought her poetry was poor. In 
	1902, Tsvetaeva's mother contracted tuberculosis. Because it was believed 
	that a change in climate could help cure the disease, the family travelled 
	abroad until shortly before her death in 1906. They lived for a while by the 
	sea at Nervi, near Genoa. There, away from the rigid constraints of a 
	bourgeois Muscovite life, Marina was able for the first time to run free, 
	climb cliffs, and vent her imagination in childhood games. It should be 
	noted that there were many Russian émigré revolutionaries residing at that 
	time in Nervi, and undoubtedly these people would have had some influence on 
	the impressionable Marina. The children began to run wild. This state of 
	affairs was allowed to continue until June 1904, when Marina was dispatched 
	to school in Lausanne. Changes in the Tsvetaev residence led to several 
	changes in school, and during the course of her travels she acquired the 
	Italian, French, and German languages. In 1908, Tsvetaeva studied literary 
	history at the Sorbonne. During this time, a major revolutionary change was 
	occurring within Russian poetry: the flowering of the Russian Symbolist 
	movement, and this movement was to colour most of her later work. It was not 
	the theory which was to attract her, but the poetry and the immense gravity 
	which writers such as Andrey Bely and Aleksandr Blok were capable of 
	generating. Her own first collection of poems, Evening Album, was 
	self-published in 1910. It attracted the attention of the poet and critic 
	Maximilian Voloshin, whom Tsvetaeva described after his death in 'A Living 
	Word About a Living Man'. Voloshin came to see Tsvetaeva and soon became her 
	friend and mentor. <br>
	She began spending time at Voloshin's home in the Black Sea resort of 
	Koktebel (trans. &quot;Blue Height&quot;), which was a well-known haven for writers, 
	poets and artists. She became enamoured of the work of Aleksandr Blok and 
	Anna Akhmatova, although she never met Blok and did not meet Akhmatova until 
	the 1940s. Describing the Koktebel community, the émigré Viktoria Schweitzer 
	wrote: &quot;Here inspiration was born.&quot; At Koktebel, Tsvetaeva met Sergei (Seryozha) 
	Yakovlevich Efron, a cadet in the Officers' Academy. She was 19, he 18: they 
	fell in love instantly and were married in 1912, the same year as her 
	father's project, the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, was ceremonially opened, 
	an event attended by Czar Nicholas II. Tsvetaeva's love for Efron was 
	intense, however, this did not preclude her from having affairs, including 
	one with Osip Mandelstam, which she celebrated in a collection of poems 
	called Mileposts. At around the same time, she became involved in an 
	affair[citation needed] with the poet Sofia Parnok, who was 7 years older 
	than Tsvetaeva. The two women fell deeply in love, and the relationship 
	profoundly affected both women's writings. She deals with the ambiguous and 
	tempestuous nature of this relationship in a cycle of poems which at times 
	she called The Girlfriend, and at other times The Mistake. Tsvetaeva and her 
	husband spent summers in the Crimea until the revolution, and had two 
	daughters: Ariadna, or Alya (born 1912) and Irina (born 1917). Then, in 
	1914, Efron volunteered for the front; by 1917 he was an officer stationed 
	in Moscow with the 56th Reserve. Tsetsaeva was to witness the Russian 
	Revolution first hand. On trains, she came into contact with ordinary 
	Russian people and was shocked by the mood of anger and violence. She wrote 
	in her journal: &quot;In the air of the compartment hung only three axe-like 
	words: bourgeois, Junkers, leeches&quot;. After the 1917 Revolution, Efron joined 
	the White Army, and Marina returned to Moscow hoping to be reunited with her 
	husband. She was trapped in Moscow for five years, where there was a 
	terrible famine. She wrote six plays in verse and narrative poems, including 
	The Tsar's Maiden (1920), and her epic about the Civil War, The Swans' 
	Encampment, which glorified those who fought against the communists. The 
	cycle of poems in the style of a diary or journal begins on the day of Czar 
	Nicholas II's abdication in March 1917, and ends late in 1920, when the 
	anti-communist White Army was finally defeated. The 'swans' of the title 
	refers to the volunteers in the White Army, in which her husband was 
	fighting as an officer. The Moscow famine was to exact a terrible toll on 
	Tsvetaeva. Starvation and worry were to erode her looks. With no immediate 
	family to turn to, she had no way to support herself or her daughters. In 
	1919, she placed Irina in a state orphanage, mistakenly believing that she 
	would be better fed there. Tragically, she was mistaken, and Irina died of 
	starvation in 1920. The child's death caused Tsvetaeva great grief and 
	regret. In one letter, she said, 'God punished me.' During these years, 
	Tsvetaeva maintained a close and intense friendship with the actress Sofia 
	Evgenievna Holliday, for whom she wrote a number of plays. Many years later, 
	she would write the novella &quot;Povest' o Sonechke&quot; about her relationship with 
	Holliday, who ended up betraying her. </font>

	Exile </b></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Berlin and Prague<br>
	</b>In May 1922, Tsvetaeva and Ariadna left the Soviet Union and were 
	reunited with Efron in Berlin. There she published the collections 
	Separation, Poems to Blok, and the poem The Tsar Maiden. In August 1922, the 
	family moved to Prague. Unable to afford living accommodation in Prague 
	itself, with Efron studying politics and sociology at the Charles University 
	in Prague and living in hostels, Tsvetaeva and Ariadna found rooms in a 
	village outside the city. In Prague, Tsvetaeva had a passionate affair with 
	Konstantin Boeslavovich Rozdevitch, a former military officer. This affair 
	became widely known throughout émigré circles, and even to Efron himself. 
	Efron was devastated by the affair (this is well-documented and supported 
	particularly by a letter which he wrote to Voloshin on the matter). It was 
	bound to end disastrously, and it did. Her break-up with Rozdevitch in 1923 
	was almost certainly the inspiration for her great 'The Poem of the End'. 
	This relationship was also the inspiration for &quot;The Poem of the Mountain&quot;. 
	At about the same time, a more important relationship began: Tsvetaeva's 
	correspondence with Boris Pasternak, who had stayed in the Soviet Union. The 
	two were not to meet for nearly twenty years, but for a time they were in 
	love, and they maintained an intimate friendship until Tsvetaeva's return to 
	Russia. In summer 1924, Efron and Tsvetaeva left Prague for the suburbs, 
	living for a while in Jiloviste, before moving on to Vsenory, where 
	Tsvetaeva completed &quot;The Poem of the End&quot;, and was to conceive their son, 
	Georgy, whom she was to later nickname 'Mur'. Tsvetaeva wanted to name him 
	Boris (after Pasternak); Efron would have none of it and insisted on Georgy. 
	He was to be a most difficult and demanding child. Nevertheless, Tsetaeva 
	loved him in the only way she knew, obsessively. Ariadna was relegated 
	immediately to the role of mother's helper and confidante, and was 
	consequently robbed of much of her childhood. However, the child did not 
	reciprocate. The older he grew, the more difficult and obstreperous he 
	became.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Paris<br>
	</b>In 1925, the family settled in Paris, where they would live for the next 
	14 years. At about this time Efron contracted tuberculosis, adding to the 
	family's difficulties. Tsvetaeva received a meagre stipend from the 
	Czechoslovak government, which gave financial support to artists and writers 
	who had lived in Czechoslovakia. In addition, she tried to make whatever she 
	could from readings and sales of her work. She turned more and more to 
	writing prose because she found it made more money than poetry. Tsvetaeva 
	did not feel at all at home in Paris's predominantly ex-bourgeois circle of 
	Russian émigré writers. Although she had written passionately pro-White 
	poems during the Revolution, her fellow émigrés thought that she was 
	insufficiently anti-Soviet, and that her criticism of the Soviet régime was 
	altogether too nebuluous. She was particularly criticised for writing an 
	admiring letter to the Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. In the wake of this 
	letter, the émigré paper The Latest News, to which Tsvetaeva had been a 
	frequent contributor, refused point blank to publish any more of her work. 
	She found solace in her correspondence with other writers, including Boris 
	Pasternak, Rainer Maria Rilke, the Czech poet Anna Teskova, and the critics 
	D. S. Mirsky and Aleksandr Bakhrakh.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Husband's involvement with espionage<br>
	</b>Meanwhile, Tsvetaeva's husband was rapidly developing Soviet sympathies 
	and was homesick for Russia. He was, however, afraid because of his past as 
	a White soldier. Eventually, either out of idealism or to garner acceptance 
	from the Communists, he began spying for the NKVD, the forerunner of the 
	KGB. Alya shared his views, and increasingly turned against her mother. In 
	1937, she returned to the Soviet Union. Later that year, Efron too had to 
	return to Russia. The French police had implicated him in the murder of the 
	former Soviet defector Ignaty Reyss in September 1937, on a country lane 
	near Lausanne. After Efron's escape, the police interrogated Tsvetaeva, but 
	she seemed confused by their questions and ended up reading them some French 
	translations of her poetry. The police concluded that she was deranged and 
	knew nothing of the murder. (Later it was learned that Efron possibly had 
	also taken part in the assassination of Trotsky's son in 1936). Tsvetaeva 
	does not seem to have known that her husband was a spy, nor the extent to 
	which he was compromised. However, she was held responsible for his actions 
	and was ostracised in Paris because of the implication that he was involved 
	with the NKVD. World War II had made Europe as unsafe and hostile as Russia. 
	Tsvetaeva felt that she no longer had a choice.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Return to the Soviet Union<br>
	</b>In 1939, she and her son returned to the Soviet Union. She could not 
	have foreseen the horrors which were in store for her. In Stalin's Russia, 
	anyone who had lived abroad was suspect, as was anyone who had been among 
	the intelligentsia before the Revolution. Tsvetaeva's sister had been 
	arrested before Tsvetaeva's return; although Anastasia survived the Stalin 
	years, the sisters never saw each other again. Tsvetaeva found that all 
	doors had closed to her. She got bits of work translating poetry, but 
	otherwise the established Soviet writers refused to help her, and chose to 
	ignore her plight; Aseyev, who she had hoped would assist, shyed away, 
	fearful for his life and position. Efron and Alya were arrested for 
	espionage. Alya's fiancé, it turned out, was actually an NKVD agent who had 
	been assigned to spy on the family. Efron was shot in 1941; Alya served over 
	eight years in prison. Both were exonerated after Stalin's death. In 1941, 
	Tsvetaeva and her son were evacuated to Yelabuga, while most families of the 
	Union of Soviet writers were evacuated to Chistopol. Tsvetaeva had no means 
	of support in Yelabuga, and on August 24, 1941 she left for Chistopol 
	desperately seeking for a job. On August 26, 1941, Marina Tsvetaeva and poet 
	Valentin Parnakh applied to the Soviet of Literature Fund asking for a job 
	at the LitFund's canteen. Valentin Parnakh was accepted as a doorman, while 
	Tsvetaeva's application for a permission to live in Chistopol was turned 
	down and she had to return to Yelabuga on August 28. On 31 August, 1941 
	while living in Yelabuga, Tsvetaeva hanged herself. She was buried in 
	Yelabuga cemetery on September 2, 1941, but the exact location of her grave 
	remains unknown. There have always been rumours that Tsvetaeva's death 
	wasn't suicide. On the day of her death she was home alone (her host family 
	was out) and, according to Yelabuga residents, NKVD agents came to her house 
	and forced her to commit suicide. These rumours remain unconfirmed. In the 
	town of Yelabuga, the Tsvetaeva house museum can be visited, as well as a 
	monument to her. In the museum, Tsvetaeva's farewell note, written just 
	before her death, can be seen.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Her work<br>
	</b>From a poem she wrote in 1913, in which she displays her propensity for 
	prophecy: </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Scattered in bookstores, greyed by dust 
	and time, <br>
	Unseen, unsought, unopened, and unsold, <br>
	My poems will be savoured as are rarest wines - <br>
	When they are old. <br>
	</i><br>
	Conversely, her poetry was much admired by poets such as Valery Bryusov, 
	Maximilian Voloshin, Osip Mandelstam, Boris Pasternak, Rainer Maria Rilke, 
	and Anna Akhmatova. Today, that recognition is sustained by the poet Joseph 
	Brodsky, pre-eminent among Tsvetaeva's champions. Tsvetaeva is primarily a 
	poet-lyricist, since her lyrical voice remains clearly audible in her 
	narrative poetry. Her lyric poems fill ten collections; the uncollected 
	lyrics would add at least another volume. Her first two collections indicate 
	their subject matter in their titles: Evening Album (Vechernii al'bom, 1910) 
	and The Magic Lantern (Volshebnyi fonar', 1912). The poems are vignettes of 
	a tranquil childhood and youth in a professorial, middle-class home in 
	Moscow, and display considerable grasp of the formal elements of style. The 
	full range of Tsvetaeva's talent developed quickly, and was undoubtedly 
	influenced by the contacts which she had made at Koktebel, and was made 
	evident in two new collections: Mileposts (Versty, 1921) and Mileposts: Book 
	One (Versty, Vypusk I, 1922). Three elements of Tsvetaeva's mature style 
	emerge in the Mileposts collections. First, Tsvetaeva dates her poems and 
	publishes them chronologically. The poems in Mileposts: Book One, for 
	example, were written in 1916 and resolve themselves as a versified journal. 
	Secondly, there are cycles of poems which fall into a regular chronological 
	sequence among the single poems, evidence that certain themes demanded 
	further expression and development. One cycle announces the theme of 
	Mileposts: Book One as a whole: the &quot;Poems of Moscow.&quot; Two other cycles are 
	dedicated to poets, the &quot;Poems to Akhmatova&quot; and the &quot;Poems to Blok&quot;, which 
	again reappear in a separate volume, Poems to Blok (Stikhi k Bloku, 1922). 
	Thirdly, the Mileposts collections demonstrate the dramatic quality of 
	Tsvetaeva's work, and her ability to assume the guise of multiple dramatis 
	personae within them. The collection entitled Separation (Razluka, 1922) was 
	to contain Tsvetaeva's first long verse narrative, &quot;On a Red Steed&quot; (Na 
	krasnom kone). The poem is a prologue to three more verse-narratives written 
	between 1920 and 1922. All four narrative poems draw on folkloric plots. 
	Tsvetaeva acknowledges her sources in the titles of the very long works, The 
	Maiden-Tsar: A Fairy-tale Poem (Tsar'-devitsa: Poema-skazka, 1922) and &quot;The 
	Swain&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Fairytale&quot; (Molodets: skazka, 1924). The fourth 
	folklore-style poem is entitled &quot;Byways&quot; (Pereulochki, published in 1923 in 
	the collection Remeslo), and it is the first poem which may be deemed 
	incomprehensible in that it is fundamentally a soundscape of language. The 
	collection Psyche (Psikheya, 1923) contains one of Tsvetaeva's best-known 
	cycles &quot;Insomnia&quot; (Bessonnitsa) and the poem The Swans' Encampment (Lebedinyi 
	stan, Stikhi 1917-1921, published in 1957) which celebrates the White Army. 
	Subsequently, as an émigré, Tsvetaeva's last two collections of lyrics were 
	published by émigré presses, Craft (Remeslo, 1923) in Berlin and After 
	Russia (Posle Rossii, 1928) in Paris. There then followed the twenty-three 
	lyrical &quot;Berlin&quot; poems, the pantheistic &quot;Trees&quot; (Derev'ya), &quot;Wires&quot; (Provoda) 
	and &quot;Pairs&quot; (Dvoe), and the tragic &quot;Poets&quot; (Poetry). &quot;After Russia&quot; contains 
	the poem &quot;In Praise of the Rich&quot;, in which Tsvetaeva's oppositional tone is 
	merged with her proclivity for ruthless satire. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1924, Tsvetaeva wrote &quot;Poem of the End&quot;, 
	which details a walk around Prague and across its bridges; the walk is about 
	the final walk she will take with her lover Konstantin Rodzevitch. In it 
	everything is foretold: in the first few lines (translated by Elaine 
	Feinstein) the future is already written: </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>A single post, a point of rusting <br>
	tin in the sky <br>
	marks the fated place we <br>
	move to, he and I <br>
	</i><br>
	Again, further poems foretell future developments. Principal among these is 
	the voice of the classically-oriented Tsvetaeva heard in cycles &quot;The Sibyl,&quot; 
	&quot;Phaedra,&quot; and &quot;Ariadne.&quot; Tsvetaeva's beloved, ill-starred heroines recur in 
	two verse plays, Theseus-Ariadne (Tezei-Ariadna, 1927) and Phaedra (Fedra, 
	1928). These plays form the first two parts of an incomplete trilogy 
	entitled Aphrodite's Rage. The satirist in Tsvetaeva plays second fiddle 
	only to the poet-lyricist. Several satirical poems, moreover, are among 
	Tsvetaeva's best-known works: &quot;The Train of Life&quot; (Poezd zhizni) and &quot;The 
	Floorcleaners' Song&quot; (Poloterskaya), both included in After Russia, and The 
	Rat-catcher (Krysolov, 1925-1926), a long, folkloric narrative. The target 
	of Tsvetaeva's satire is everything petty and petty bourgeois. Unleashed 
	against such dull creature comforts is the vengeful, unearthly energy of 
	workers both manual and creative. In her notebook, Tsvetaeva writes of &quot;The 
	Floorcleaners' Song&quot;: &quot;Overall movement: the floorcleaners ferret out a 
	house's hidden things, they scrub a fire into the door... What do they flush 
	out? Coziness, warmth, tidiness, order... Smells: incense, piety. Bygones. 
	Yesterday... The growing force of their threat is far stronger than the 
	climax.&quot; The poem which Tsvetaeva describes as liricheskaia satira, The 
	Rat-Catcher, is loosely based on the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. 
	The Rat-Catcher, which is also known as The Pied Piper, is considered by 
	some to be the finest of Tsvetaeva's work. It was also partially an act of 
	hommage to Heinrich Heine's poem Die Wanderatten. The Rat-Catcher appeared 
	initially, in serial format, in the émigré journal Volia Rossii in 1925-1926 
	whilst still being written. It was not to appear in the Soviet Union until 
	after the death of Stalin in 1956. Its hero is the Pied Piper of Hamelin who 
	saves a town from hordes of rats and then leads the town's children away 
	too, in retribution for the citizens' ingratitude. As in the other folkloric 
	narratives, The Ratcatcher's story line emerges indirectly through numerous 
	speaking voices which shift from invective, to extended lyrical flights, to 
	bathos. Tsvetaeva's last ten years of exile, from 1928 when &quot;After Russia&quot; 
	appeared until her return in 1939 to the Soviet Union, were principally a 
	&quot;prose decade&quot;, though this would almost certainly be by dint of economic 
	necessity rather than one of choice. <br>

	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Translators<br>
	</b>Translators of Tsvetaeva's work into English include Elaine Feinstein 
	and David McDuff. Nina Kossman translated many of Tsvetaeva's long 
	(narrative) poems, as well as her lyrical poems; they are collected in two 
	books, Poem of the End and In the Inmost Hour of the Soul. J. Marin King 
	translated a great deal of Tsvetaeva's prose into English, compiled in a 
	book called A Captive Spirit. Tsvetaeva scholar Angela Livingstone has 
	translated a number of Tsvetaeva's essays on art and writing, compiled in a 
	book called Art in the Light of Conscience. Livingstone's translation of 
	Tsvetaeva's &quot;The Ratcatcher&quot; was published as a separate book. Mary Jane 
	White has translated the early cycle &quot;Miles&quot; in a book called &quot;Starry Sky to 
	Starry Sky,&quot; as well has Tsvetaeva's elegy for Rilke, &quot;New Year's,&quot; (Adastra 
	Press 16 Reservation Road, Easthampton, MA 01027 USA) and &quot;Poem of the End&quot; 
	and &quot;Poem of the Hill.&quot; (New England Review). In 2002, Yale University Press 
	published Jamey Gambrell's translation of post-revolutionary prose, entitled 
	Earthly Signs: Moscow Diaries, 1917-1922, with notes on poetic and 
	linguistic aspects of Tsvetaeva's prose, and endnotes for the text itself. 
	The Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich set six of Tsvetaeva's poems to 
	music. Later the Russian-Tatar composer Sofia Gubaidulina wrote a Hommage à 
	Marina Tsvetayeva featuring her poems. Her poem, Mne Nravitsya (it pleases 
	me), was performed by Alla Pugacheva in the film Irony of Fate. <br>

	</i></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
	Hofmannsthal was born in Vienna, the son of an upper-class Austrian mother 
	and an Austrian-Italian bank manager. His great-grandfather, Isaak Löw 
	Hofmann, Edler von Hofmannsthal, from whom his family inherited the noble 
	title &quot;Edler von Hofmannsthal,&quot; was a Jewish merchant ennobled by the 
	Austrian emperor. He began to write poems and plays from an early age. He 
	met the German poet Stefan George at the age of seventeen and had several 
	poems published in George's journal, Blätter für die Kunst. He studied law 
	and later philology in Vienna but decided to devote himself to writing upon 
	graduating in 1901. Along with Peter Altenberg and Arthur Schnitzler, he was 
	a member of the avant garde group Young Vienna (Junges Wien). In 1900, 
	Hofmannsthal met the composer Richard Strauss for the first time. He later 
	wrote libretti for several of his operas, including Elektra (1909), Der 
	Rosenkavalier (1911), Ariadne auf Naxos (1912, rev. 1916), Die Frau ohne 
	Schatten (1919), Die ägyptische Helena (1927), and Arabella (1933). In 1901, 
	he married Gertrud (Gerty) Schlesinger, the daughter of a Viennese banker. 
	Gerty, who was Jewish, converted to Christianity before their marriage. They 
	settled in Rodaun, not far from Vienna, and had three children. In 1912 he 
	adapted the 15th century English morality play Everyman as Jedermann, and 
	Jean Sibelius (amongst others) wrote incidental music for it. The play later 
	became a staple at the Salzburg Festival. During the First World War 
	Hofmannsthal held a government post. He wrote speeches and articles 
	supporting the war effort, and emphasizing the cultural tradition of 
	Austria-Hungary. The end of the war spelled the end of the old monarchy in 
	Austria; this was a blow from which the patriotic and conservative-minded 
	Hofmannsthal never fully recovered. Nevertheless the years after the war 
	were very productive ones for Hofmannsthal; he continued with his earlier 
	literary projects, almost without a break. In 1920, Hofmannsthal, along with 
	Max Reinhardt, founded the Salzburg Festival. His later plays revealed a 
	growing interest in religious, particularly Roman Catholic, themes. Among 
	his writings was a screenplay for a film version of Der Rosenkavalier (1925) 
	directed by Robert Wiene. </font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On July 13, 1929 his son Franz committed 
	suicide. Two days later, Hofmannsthal himself died of a stroke at Rodaun.
	<br>
	<br>
	On October 18, 1902, Hoffmannsthal published a fictive letter in the Berlin 
	Daily, Der Tag (The Day) titled simply &quot;Ein Brief&quot; (&quot;A Letter&quot;). It was 
	purportedly written in 1603 by Philip, Lord Chandos to Francis Bacon. In 
	this letter Chandos says that he has stopped writing because he has &quot;lost 
	completely the ability to think or to speak of anything coherently&quot;; he has 
	given up on the possibility of language to describe the world. This letter 
	reflects the growing distrust of and dissatisfaction with language that so 
	characterizes the Modern era, and Chandos's dissolving personality is not 
	only individual but societal. Growing up the son of a wealthy merchant who 
	was well connected with the major artists of the time, Hofmannsthal was 
	raised in what Carl Schorske refers to as &quot;the temple of art&quot;. This perfect 
	setting for aesthetic isolation allowed Hofmannsthal the unique perspective 
	of the privileged artist, but also allowed him to see that art had become a 
	flattened documenting of humanity, which took our instincts and desires and 
	framed them for viewing without acquiring any of the living, passionate 
	elements. Because of this realization, Hofmannsthal&#8217;s idea of the role of 
	the artist began to take shape as someone who created works that would 
	inspire or inflame the instinct, rather than merely preserving it in a 
	creative form. He also began to think that the artist should not be someone 
	isolated and left to his art, but rather a man of the world, immersed in 
	both politics and art. Hofmannsthal saw in English culture the ideal setting 
	for the artist. This was because the English simultaneously admired Admiral 
	Nelson and John Milton, both war heroes and poets, while still maintaining a 
	solid national identity. &quot;In [Hofmannsthal&#8217;s] view, the division between 
	artist (writer) and man of action (politician, explorer, soldier) does not 
	exist in England. Britain provides her subjects with a common base of energy 
	which functions as equilibrium, a force lacking in fragmented Germany&quot;. 
	(Weiss) This singular and yet pragmatic identity must have appealed to 
	Hofmannsthal to a certain degree due to the large scale fragmentation of 
	Austria at the time, which was in the throes of radical nationalism and 
	anti-Semitism, a nation in which the progressive artist and the progressive 
	politician were growing more </font><font face="Verdana">different and 
	hostile to each other by the day. </font></td>

	Guillaume Apollinaire (August 26, 1880 &#8211; November 9, 1918) was a French 
	poet, writer, and art critic born in Italy to a Polish mother. <br>
	Among the foremost poets of the early 20th century, he is credited with 
	coining the word surrealism and writing one of the earliest works described 
	as surrealist, the play Les Mamelles de Tirésias (1917, later used as the 
	basis for an opera in 1947). Two years after being wounded in World War I, 
	he died at 38 of the Spanish flu during the pandemic. <br>
	Born Wilhelm Albert Vladimir Apollinaris Kostrowitzky and raised speaking 
	French, among other languages, he emigrated to France and adopted the name 
	Guillaume Apollinaire. His mother, born Angelica Kostrowicka, was a Polish 
	noblewoman born near Navahrudak (now in Belarus). His father is unknown but 
	may have been Francesco Flugi d'Aspermont, a Swiss Italian aristocrat who 
	disappeared early from Apollinaire's life. He was partly educated in Monaco. 
	Apollinaire was one of the most popular members of the artistic community of 
	Montparnasse in Paris. His friends and collaborators during that period 
	included Pablo Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Max Jacob, André Salmon, Marie 
	Laurencin, André Breton, André Derain, Faik Konica, Blaise Cendrars, Pierre 
	Reverdy, Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie, Ossip Zadkine, Marc Chagall and Marcel 
	Duchamp. In 1911, he joined the Puteaux Group, a branch of the cubist 
	movement. On September 7, 1911, police arrested and jailed him on suspicion 
	of stealing the Mona Lisa, but released him a week later. Apollonaire then 
	implicated his friend Pablo Picasso, who was also brought in for questioning 
	in the art theft, but he was also exonerated. He fought in World War I and, 
	in 1916, received a serious shrapnel wound to the temple. He wrote Les 
	Mamelles de Tirésias while recovering from this wound. During this period he 
	coined the word surrealism in the program notes for Jean Cocteau and Erik 
	Satie's ballet Parade, first performed on 18 May 1917. He also published an 
	artistic manifesto, L'Esprit nouveau et les poètes. Apollinaire's status as 
	a literary critic is most famous and influential in his recognition of the 
	Marquis de Sade, whose works were for a long time obscure, yet arising in 
	popularity as an influence upon the Dada and Surrealist art movements going 
	on in Montparnasse at the beginning of the twentieth century as, &quot;The freest 
	spirit that ever existed.&quot; </font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The war-weakened Apollinaire died of 
	influenza during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918. He was interred in the Le 
	Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. <br>
	<br>
	Apollinaire's first collection of poetry was L'enchanteur pourrissant 
	(1909), but Alcools (1913) established his reputation. The poems, influenced 
	in part by the Symbolists, juxtapose the old and the new, combining 
	traditional poetic forms with modern imagery. In 1913, Apollinaire published 
	the essay Les Peintres cubistes on the cubist painters, a movement which he 
	helped to define. He also coined the term orphism to describe a tendency 
	towards absolute abstraction in the paintings of Robert Delaunay and others. 
	In 1907, Apollinaire wrote the well-known erotic novel, The Eleven Thousand 
	Rods (Les Onze Mille Verges). Officially banned in France until 1970, 
	various printings of it circulated widely for many years. Apollinaire never 
	publicly acknowledged authorship of the novel. Another erotic novel 
	attributed to him was The Exploits of a Young Don Juan (Les exploits d'un 
	jeune Don Juan), in which the 15-year-old hero fathers three children with 
	various members of his entourage, including his aunt. The book was made into 
	a movie in 1987. Shortly after his death, Calligrammes, a collection of his 
	concrete poetry (poetry in which typography and layout adds to the overall 
	effect), was published. In his youth Apollinaire lived for a short while in 
	Belgium, but mastered the Walloon language sufficiently to write poetry 
	through that medium, some of which has survived.</font><font face="Verdana">

	SYMBOLISM<br>
	<br>
	</b>The reaction against experimental drama was noticeable in France as 
	early as the 1850s; a dramatisation of Zola's <i>Tberese Raquin</i> was booed off 
	the stage. Zola was a Symbolist only in the rather general sense in which 
	symbolism is a characteristic of nearly all literature. More specifically, 
	Symbolism refers to certain French writers and artists around the turn of 
	the century, perhaps to a group of Russians somewhat later and sometimes to 
	Modernism in Latin America.<br>
	The most influential figure was Mallarme whose advice to depict not the 
	thing but the effect is a kind of Symbolist motto. He advocated a new drama 
	portraying the mental life, not the world of the senses. For the Symbolists, 
	art is a means of understanding rather than feeling, and since they despised 
	mundane reality, the Symbolists were antagonistic towards Realist drama. 
	Symbolist drama tends to be learned and decidedly static.<br>
	The Art Theatre founded in the 1890s by the poet Paul Fort, was at the 
	centre of the movement, set up largely in reaction against the predominantly 
	Realist Theatre Libre of the actor-director Andre Antoine, a friend of Zola. 
	Playwrights patronized by the Art Theatre included <b>Maurice</b> <b>Maeterlinck</b>

	Johan August Strindberg (January 22, 1849 &#8211; May 14, 1912) was a Swedish 
	writer, playwright, and painter. Along with Knut Hamsun, with whom he 
	fraternized with while in Paris in the mid 1890s, Henrik Ibsen, Soren 
	Kierkegaard and Hans Christian Andersen he is arguably the most influential 
	and most important of all Scandinavian authors. Strindberg is known as one 
	of the fathers of modern theatre. His work falls into two major literary 
	movements, Naturalism and Expressionism.<br>
	Strindberg was the third son of Carl Oscar Strindberg, a shipping agent from 
	a bourgeois family, and Ulrika Eleonora (Nora) Norling. Ulrika was twelve 
	years Carl's junior and of humble origin, called a &quot;servant woman&quot; in the 
	title of Strindberg's autobiographical novel, Tjänstekvinnans son (The Son 
	of a Servant). Strindberg's paternal grandfather Zacharias was born in 1758 
	to a clergyman in Jämtland and settled in Stockholm, where he became a 
	successful spice tradesman and a major in the Burghers' Military Corps. 
	Strindberg's aunt Johanna Magdalena Elisabeth Strindberg (1797-1880), also 
	called &quot;Lisette&quot;, was married to the inventor and industrialist Samuel Owen 
	(born 1774 in Norton-in-Hales, Shropshire, England, died February 15, 1854 
	in Stockholm) who went to Sweden in 1804 to help with the installation of 
	the first steam engines for industrial use in Sweden and later in 1806 set 
	up his own workshop 'Kungsholms Mekaniska Verkstad' in Stockholm. Carl Oscar 
	Strindberg's older brother Johan Ludvig Strindberg was a successful 
	businessman, the model for the protagonist Arvid Falk's wealthy and socially 
	ambitious uncle in Strindberg's novel Röda rummet (The Red Room). 
	Strindberg's own version of his childhood is available in his novel The Son 
	of a Servant, but at least one of his biographers, Olof Lagercrantz, warns 
	against its use as a biographical source. Much of what Strindberg wrote has 
	an autobiographical character, but Lagercrantz notes Strindberg's &quot;talent to 
	make us believe what he wants us to believe,&quot; and his unwillingness to 
	accept any characterization of his person other than his own. From the age 
	of seven, Strindberg grew up in the Norrtull area on the northern, 
	almost-rural periphery of Stockholm, not far from Tegnérlunden, the park 
	where Carl Eldh's grand statue of Strindberg was later placed. He went to 
	the elementary schools of Klara and Jakob parishes, continuing to the 
	Stockholms Lyceum, a progressive private school for boys from upper and 
	upper middle class families. He completed his graduation exams studentexamen 
	on May 25, 1867, and matriculated at the University of Uppsala in the fall.

	A mural of August Strindberg at the Rådmansgatan subway stationStrindberg 
	would spend the next several years between Uppsala and Stockholm, 
	alternately studying for exams and trying his hand at non-academic pursuits. 
	As a young student, Strindberg also worked as an assistant in a chemist's 
	shop in the university town of Lund in southern Sweden. He first left 
	Uppsala in 1868 to work as a schoolteacher, but then studied chemistry for 
	some time at the Institute of Technology in Stockholm in preparation for 
	medical studies, later working as a private tutor before becoming an extra 
	at the Royal Theatre in Stockholm. He returned to Uppsala in January 1870 to 
	study and work on a set of plays, the first of which opened at the Royal 
	Theatre in September 1870, a biography of the Danish sculptor Bertel 
	Thorvaldsen. In Uppsala, he started Runa, a small literary club with friends 
	who all took pseudonyms from Nordic mythology; Strindberg called himself Frö 
	after the god of fertility. He spent a few more semesters in Uppsala, 
	finally leaving in March 1872 without graduating. He would often ridicule 
	Uppsala and its professors, as when he published Från Fjerdingen och 
	Svartbäcken (&quot;From Fjerdingen and Svartbäcken&quot;, 1877), short stories 
	depicting Uppsala student life. After leaving university for the last time, 
	he embarked on his career as a journalist and critic for newspapers in 
	Stockholm.<br>
	Strindberg was married three times, to Siri von Essen (1850-1912), Frida Uhl 
	(1872-1943), and Harriet Bosse (1878-1961). He had children with all his 
	wives, but his hypersensitive, neurotic character led to bitter divorces. 
	Late in his life he met the young actress and painter Fanny Falkner 
	(1890-1963), whose book illuminates his last years, but the exact nature of 
	their relationship is debated. He had a brief affair in Berlin with Dagny 
	Juel before his marriage to Frida; it has been suggested that the shocking 
	news of her murder was the reason he cancelled his honeymoon with his third 
	wife, Harriet. Strindberg's relationships with women were troubled and have 
	often been interpreted as misogynistic by contemporaries and modern readers. 
	Most acknowledge, however, that he had uncommon insight into the hypocrisy 
	of his society's gender roles and sexual morality. Marriage and the family 
	were under stress in Strindberg's lifetime as Sweden industrialized and 
	urbanized at a rapid pace. Problems of prostitution and poverty were debated 
	heatedly among writers, critics and politicians. His early writing often 
	dealt with the traditional roles of the sexes imposed by society, which he 
	criticized as unjust.<br>
	The rise and fall of the Paris Commune in 1871 became a political awakening 
	for the young Strindberg, and he started to see politics as a conflict 
	between the upper- and lower classes. Strindberg was admired by the Swedish 
	working class as a radical writer. He was a Socialist (or maybe more of an 
	Anarchist which he himself claimed on at least one occasion) and his 
	daughter Karin Strindberg married Vladimir Smirnov, one of the leading 
	Russian Bolsheviks. Because of his political standpoints, Strindberg was 
	heavily promoted in socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe, as 
	well as in the Soviet Union and Cuba.<br>
	A multi-faceted author, Strindberg was often extreme. His novel The Red Room 
	(Röda rummet) (1879) brought him fame. His early plays were written in the 
	Naturalistic style, and his works from this time are often compared with the 
	Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. Strindberg's best-known play from this 
	period is Miss Julie (Fröken Julie). Strindberg wanted to attain what he 
	called &quot;Greater Naturalism.&quot; He did not prefer expository character 
	backgrounds seen in the work of Ibsen, or write plays that gave his 
	audiences a &quot;slice of life&quot; because he felt that these plays were mundane 
	and uninteresting. Strindberg felt that true naturalism was a psychological 
	battle of the brains (hjarnornas kamp). Two people who hate each other in 
	the immediate moment and strive to drive the other to doom is the type of 
	mental hostility that Strindberg strove to capture. Furthermore, he intended 
	his plays to be impartial and objective, citing a desire to make literature 
	somewhat of a science. Later, he underwent a time of inner turmoil known as 
	the Inferno Period, which culminated in the production of a book written in 
	French, Inferno. He also exchanged a few cryptic letters with Nietzsche. 
	Strindberg subsequently broke with Naturalism and began to produce works 
	informed by Symbolism. He is considered one of the pioneers of the Modern 
	European stage and Expressionism. The Dance of Death (Dödsdansen), A Dream 
	Play (Ett drömspel) and The Ghost Sonata (Spöksonaten) are well-known plays 
	from this period.<br>
	Strindberg was also a telegrapher, painter, photographer and alchemist. 
	Painting and photography offered venues for his belief that chance played a 
	crucial part in the creative process. Strindberg's paintings were unique for 
	their time, and went beyond those of his contemporaries for their radical 
	lack of adherence to visual reality. The 117 paintings that are accepted as 
	being by his hand were mostly painted within the span of a few years, and 
	are now seen as among the most original works of nineteenth century art. 
	Though Strindberg was friends with Edvard Munch and Paul Gauguin, and was 
	thus familiar with modern trends, the spontaneous and subjective 
	expressiveness of his landscapes and seascapes can be ascribed also to the 
	fact that he painted only in periods of personal crisis.<br>
	Carl Eldh's grand statue of Strindberg in Tegnérlunden, 
	StockholmStrindberg's last home was Blå tornet in central Stockholm, where 
	he lived from 1908 until 1912. Today it is a museum. By the end of his life 
	Strindberg had returned to Christianity, authoring religious works inspired 
	by Emanuel Swedenborg. One year before his death, his main book publisher 
	Albert Bonniers förlag bought the rights to all his writings for 200,000 
	Swedish crowns, a fortune at that time, which Strindberg promptly shared 
	with his children. On Christmas 1911, Strindberg became sick with pneumonia, 
	and he never fully recovered. At this time he also started to suffer from a 
	stomach disease, presumably cancer. He died in May 1912 at the age of 63. 
	Strindberg was interred in the Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm, and 
	thousands of people followed him during the funeral proceedings. </font>

	Maurice Polydore Marie Bernard, Count Maeterlinck (August 29, 1862 - May 6, 
	1949) was a Belgian poet, playwright, and essayist writing in French. He was 
	awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911. The main themes in his work 
	are death and the meaning of life.<br>
	Count Maurice Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium to a wealthy, 
	French-speaking family. His father, Polydore, was a notary, who enjoyed 
	tending the hothouses on their property. His mother, Mathilde, came from a 
	wealthy family.In September, 1874 he was sent to the Jesuit College of 
	Sainte-Barbe, where works of the French Romantics were scorned. Only plays 
	on religious subjects were permitted. His experiences at this school 
	undoubtedly influenced his distaste for the Catholic Church and organized 
	religion.He had written poems and short novels during his studies, but his 
	father wanted him to go into law. After finishing his law studies at the 
	University of Ghent in 1885, he spent a few months in Paris, France. He met 
	there some members of the then new Symbolism movement, Villiers de l'Isle 
	Adam in particular. The latter would have a big influence on the work of 
	Maeterlinck. In 1889, he became famous overnight after his first play, La 
	Princesse Maleine, had received enthusiastic praise from Octave Mirbeau, the 
	literary critic of Le Figaro (August 1890). In the following years, he wrote 
	a series of symbolist plays characterized by fatalism and mysticism, most 
	importantly L'Intruse (The Intruder, 1890), Les Aveugles (The Blind, 1890) 
	and Pelléas et Mélisande (1892). He had a relationship with the singer and 
	actress Georgette Leblanc from 1895 till 1918. Leblanc influenced his work 
	for the following two decades. With the play Aglavaine et Sélysette 
	Maeterlinck began to create characters, especially female characters, more 
	in control of their destinies. Leblanc performed these female characters on 
	stage. Even though mysticism and metaphysics influenced his work throughout 
	his career, he slowly replaced his Symbolism with a more existential style. 
	In 1895, with his parents frowning upon his open relationship with an 
	actress, Maeterlinck and Leblanc moved to the district of Passy in Paris. 
	The Catholic Church was unwilling to grant her a divorce from her Spanish 
	husband. They frequently entertained guests, including Mirbeau, Jean 
	Lorraine, and Paul Fort. They spent their summers in Normandy. During this 
	period, Maeterlinck published his Douze Chansons (1896), Treasure of the 
	Humble (1896), The Life of the Bee (1901), and Ariane et Barbe-Bleue (&quot;Ariadne 
	and Bluebeard,&quot; 1902).In 1903, Maeterlinck received the Triennial Prize for 
	Dramatic Literature from the Belgian government.In 1906, Maeterlinck and 
	Leblanc moved to a villa in Grasse. He spent his hours meditating and 
	walking. As he emotionally pulled away from Leblanc, he entered a state of 
	depression. Diagnosed with neurasthenia, he rented the Benedictine Abbey of 
	St. Wandrille in Normandy to help him relax. Leblanc would often walk around 
	in the dress of an abbess; he would wear roller skates as he moved about the 
	house. During this time, he wrote his essay L'Intelligence des fleurs (&quot;The 
	Intelligence of Flowers,&quot; 1906), in which he discussed politics and 
	championed socialist ideas. He donated money to many workers' unions and 
	socialist groups. At this time he conceived his greatest contemporary 
	success: the fairy play L'Oiseau Bleu (The Blue Bird, 1908). He also wrote 
	Marie-Victoire (1907) and Mary Magdalene (1908) with lead roles for Leblanc. 
	Aside from L'Oiseau Bleu, critics did not praise these plays, and they 
	considered Leblanc no longer an inspiration to the playwright. Even though 
	alfresco performances of some of his plays at St. Wandrille had been 
	successful, Maeterlinck felt that he was losing his privacy. The death of 
	his mother on June 11, 1910 added to his depression.In 1910 he met the 
	eighteen-year-old actress Renée Dahon during a rehearsal of The Blue Bird. 
	She became his lighthearted companion. Winning the Nobel Prize for 
	Literature served to heighten his spirits, as well. By 1913, he was more 
	openly socialist and sided with the Belgian trade unions against the 
	Catholic party during a strike. In fact, he began to study mysticism and 
	lambasted the Catholic church in his essays for construing the history of 
	the universe. By a decree of 26 January 1914, his opera omnia was placed on 
	the Index Librorum Prohibitorum by the Roman Catholic Church. When Germany 
	invaded Belgium in 1914, Maeterlink wished to join the French Foreign 
	Legion, but his application was denied due to his age. He and Leblanc 
	decided to leave Grasse for a villa near Nice, where he spent the next 
	decade of his life. He gave speeches on the bravery of the Belgian people 
	and placed guilt upon all Germans for the war. While in Nice he wrote the 
	plays Le Bourgemestre de Stilmonde (The Burgomaster of Stilmonde), which was 
	quickly labeled by the American press as a &quot;Great War Play.&quot; He also wrote 
	Les Fiancailles (The Betrothal), a sequel to The Blue Bird, in which the 
	heroine of the play is clearly not a Leblanc archetype.On February 15, 1919 
	Maeterlinck married Dahon. He accepted an invitation to the United States. 
	Samuel Goldwyn asked him to produce a few scenarios for film. Only two of 
	Maeterlinck's submissions still exist; Goldwyn didn't use any of his 
	submissions. Maeterlinck had prepared one based on his The Life of a Bee. 
	After reading the first few pages Goldwyn burst out of his office, 
	exclaiming: &quot;My God! The hero is a bee!&quot; Dahon gave birth to a stillborn 
	child in 1925. By the 1920s, Maeterlinck found himself no longer in tune 
	with the times. His plays of this period (La Puissance des morts, Le Grand 
	Secret, Berniquel) received little attention. At this time he penned his 
	first works on entomology. In 1926 he published La Vie des Termites (The 
	Life of the Termite), plagiarising The Soul of the White Ant, researched and 
	written by the South African poet and scientist Eugene Marais (1871 - 1936). 
	Marais' later suicide has been attributed to this act of plagiarism by some. 
	Maeterlinck's own words in La Vie de Termites indicate that the possible 
	discovery or accusation of plagiarism worried him: It would have been easy, 
	in regard to every statement, to allow the text to bristle with footnotes 
	and references. In some chapters there is not a sentence but would have 
	clamoured for these; and the letterpress would have been swallowed up by 
	vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful books we hated so much at 
	school. There is a short bibliography at the end of the volume which will no 
	doubt serve the same purpose. Despite these misgivings, there is no 
	reference to Eugene Marais in the bibliography. His other works on 
	entomology include L'Araignée de verre (The Glass Spider, 1923) and Vie des 
	fourmis (The Life of the Ant, 1930). In 1930 he bought a chateau in Nice, 
	France, and named it Orlamonde, a name occurring in his work Quinze 
	Chansons. He was made a count by Albert I, King of the Belgians in 1932. 
	According to an article published in the New York Times in 1940, he arrived 
	in the United States from Lisbon on the Greek Liner Nea Hellas. He had fled 
	to Lisbon in order to escape the Nazi invasion of both Belgium and France. 
	The Times quoted him as saying, &quot;I knew that if I was captured by the 
	Germans I would be shot at once, since I have always been counted as an 
	enemy of Germany because of my play, 'Le Bourgmestre de Stillemonde,' which 
	dealt with the conditions in Belgium during the German Occupation of 1918.&quot; 
	As with his earlier visit to America, he still found Americans too casual, 
	friendly and Francophilic for his taste.He returned to Nice after the war on 
	August 10, 1947. In 1948, the French Academy awarded him the Medal for the 
	French Language. He died in Nice on May 6, 1949 after suffering a heart 
	attack. There was no priest at his funeral.<br>
	<br>
	Maeterlinck, before 1905Maeterlinck, an avid reader of Arthur Schopenhauer, 
	considered man powerless against the forces of fate. He believed that any 
	actor, due to the hindrance of physical mannerisms and expressions, would 
	inadequately portray the symbolic figures of his plays. He concluded that 
	marionettes were an excellent alternative. Being guided by strings, which 
	are operated by a puppeteer, marionettes are an excellent representation of 
	fate's complete control over man. He wrote Intérieur, La Mort de Tintagiles, 
	and Alladine and Palomides for marionette theatre.From this, he gradually 
	developed his notion of the static drama. He felt that it was the artist's 
	responsibility to create something that expressed nothing of human emotions 
	but rather of the external forces that compel people. Materlinck once said: 
	&quot;The stage is a place where works of art are extinguished. [...] Poems die 
	when living people get into them.&quot;He explained his ideas on the static drama 
	in his essay &quot;The Tragedies of Daily Life,&quot; which appeared in The Treasure 
	of the Humble. The actors were to speak and move as if pushed and pulled by 
	an external force, fate as puppeteer. They were not to allow the stress of 
	their inner emotions to compel their movements. Maeterlinck would often 
	continue to refer to his cast of characters as &quot;marionettes.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Pelléas et Mélisande inspired four major musical compositions at the turn of 
	the twentieth century, an opera by Claude Debussy, (L 88, Paris, 1902), 
	incidental music to the play composed by Jean Sibelius (opus 46, 1905), an 
	orchestral suite by Gabriel Fauré (opus 80, 1898), and a symphonic poem by 
	Arnold Schoenberg (opus 5, 1902/03). </font></td>

	EXPRESSIONISM<br>
	<br>
	</b>As J. B. Priestley remarked 'it is a waste of time trying to find an 
	exact definition of Expressionism in drama'. In its most forceful, 
	revolutionary phase, it belonged to the Berlin theatre of the early 1920s, 
	more broadly to Central Europe in the first quarter of the century, and more 
	broadly still to much non-Realist drama. The term was first used of painting 
	in which the painter 'sought to express emotional experience rather than 
	impressions of the physical world'. The young Expressionist playwrights had 
	large ambitions, seeking a spiritual transformation of society, and, in 
	terms of the drama, abandoning objectivity and attempting to capture the 
	subjective depths of modern poetry and the greater scope of, significantly, 
	the cinema (where Expressionism had powerful effects . Rebelling against 
	most current values. Expressionist playwrights turned to once-taboo subjects 
	such as sex and class. The typical Expressionist 'hero' (always male) is not 
	involved in a plot but in some kind of inward odyssey, and the mood is often 
	violent, always extreme. Stage designers were influenced by Expressionist 
	art, with atmospheric lighting, fierce colours, and jagged lines. Beyond 
	Central Europe, the Expressionist influence was not great, though an 
	exception might be made for <b>Eugene O'Neill</b>.</font></td>

	Son of an actor, <b>Eugene O'Neill</b> (1888-1953), as with so many American 
	writers, knocked about in various colourful jobs (gold prospector, seaman, 
	etc.) before beginning to write plays, mainly naturalistic dramas based on 
	his maritime experience, while confined in a tuberculosis sanatorium. He 
	became involved with the Provincetow n Players, a group of actors and 
	writers who founded an art theatre in a converted New England fishing shack 
	in 1915, and the company produced his early plays. With <i>Beyond the Horizon</i>, 
	a full-length realistic drama, and the Expressionist <i>The Emperor Jones</i> (both 
	1920), about the rise and fall of a black adventurer, he achieved national 
	recognition. Although O'Neill is generally known for only a handful of 
	plays, he was at this time extremely prolific: between 1920-22 he produced 
	nine plays. He was widely recognized as America's first great playwright, 
	and became a major influence on later American drama.<br>
	Influenced by Ibsen, Strindberg and Greek tragedy, O'Neill was an 
	experimental dramatist who did not find his true voice until comparatively 
	late. The New England tragedy <i>Desire under the Elms </i>(1924) is 
	naturalistic in form.<i> Strange Interlude </i>(1928) is an 
	experiment in the dramatic use of the stream-of-consciousness technique, and 
	<i>Mourning Becomes Electra </i>(1931) is O'Neill's rewriting of Aeschylus set in 
	the American Cavil War. After <i>Ah,</i> <i>Wilderness!</i> (1933), uncharacteristically a 
	nostalgic comedy, and the unsuccessful <i>Days Without End </i>(1934), no new play 
	appeared for twelve years, due largely to ill health, although he did not 
	stop writing. His final period began with <i>The Iceman Cometh</i> (1946), a long, 
	naturalistic tragedy of the pipe-dreaming no-hopers in a saloon on New 
	York's Bowery. His masterpiece, <i>Long Day's Journey into Night </i>(1956) was 
	written in the early 1940s and first performed posthumously. It recounts a 
	day in the lives of the troubled, mutually destructive Tyrone family, based 
	on his own. <i>A Moon for</i> <i>the Misbegotten </i>(1957) concerns the self-destruction 
	of the elder brother of the family after the mother's death.</font></td>

	THE THEATRE OF THE ABSURD<br>
	<br>
	</b>This term describes the work of a number of avant-garde playwrights 
	during the middle of the 20th century, including Edward Albee (born 1928), 
	Beckett and Pinter. The philosophical idea of the Theatre of the Absurd was 
	the result of contemporary interest in the absurdity of the human condition 
	deriving partly from Albert Camus, especially from his essays The Rebel and 
	<i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>, first published in English in 1953 and 1955 
	respectively. Its antecedents, however, were much older, going back at least 
	to Alfred Jarry (187.3-1907), whose <i>Ubit roi</i> the first of several 'Ubu' 
	plays, was produced at the anti-Naturalistic Theatre de l'Oeuvre in Paris in 
	1896. Jarry was an eccentric humorist, inventor of pataphysics, 'the science 
	of imaginary solutions', but hostile to the social order, and Ubu, a 
	caricature of the bourgeoisie, is unpleasant as well as absurd. Jarry was a 
	major influence on the Surrealists as well as the Theatre of the Absurd.<br>
	Another influence on post-1945 drama and an early opponent of Naturalism was 
	the Italian Luigi Pirandello (1867&#8212;1936), whose plays - <i>Six</i> <i>Characters in 
	Search of an Author </i>(1921) being probably the best known &#8212; questioned the 
	reality of appearances and explored the breakdown of personality in a manner 
	anticipating <b>Beckett</b>.</font></td>

	</b>Romanian-born <b>Eugene Ionescu</b> (1912&#8212;94) was an admirer of Jarry and also 
	found comedy in the absurd, notably in <i>The Bald Prima Donna</i> (1948), 
	constructed largely from the banal phrases of a French phrase book. His 
	later 'anti-plays', often featuring a bewildered author-figure, fuse humour 
	with grim and tragic elements, even despair. In his most successful play. 
	<i>Rhinoceros</i> (1959), human beings are turned into rampaging pachyderms by an 
	increasingly totalitarian society.<br>
	The rough early life, much of it spent in prison, of the 'saintly monster&quot; 
	Jean Genet (1910-86) furnished material for his plays, notably <i>The Maids</i> 
	(1947), <i>The Balcony </i>(1957) and <i>The Blacks</i> (1958). Illusion battles with 
	reality, and bizarre, often violent fantasies are played out in a dream-like 
	atmosphere that, in spite of Genet's declared amoral and hedonistic 
	principles, approaches religious ritual. This was something like the form of 
	drama, misleadmgly called the 'Theatre of Cruelty&quot;, advocated by the 
	actor-director Antonin Artaud (1896-1948).</font></td>

	</b>The idea that the world is absurd, mysterious beyond comprehension, 
	naturally gives rise to pessimistic sentiments, bewilderment and a sense of 
	purposelessness. Representing these themes in drama can have enervating 
	effects. Plots become more illogical or non-existent, dialogue minimal and 
	obscure. Theatregoers for whom the naturalistic drama is the norm naturally 
	complain of these difficulties. Compensations include humour, an important 
	element in Beckett's renowned play <i>Waiting for Godot</i> (1952, first performed 
	in English in 1955), which had a massive impact on modern drama and is 
	chiefly responsible for Beckett's reputation as the most innovative, 
	influential writer of his time.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Samuel Beckett</b> (1906-89) was born near Dublin, went to Paris, where he later 
	settled permanently, and met Joyce, a lifelong friend and subject of his 
	first book. Most of his work was written in French, sometimes translated 
	into English by himself. His later stage plays include <i>Endgame</i> (1957),
	<i>Krapp's Last Tape</i> (1958) and <i>Happy Days</i> (1961). With <i>Come and Go</i> (1966), 
	containing 121 words, and<i> Breath</i> (1969), lasting 30 seconds, he took 
	minimalism as far as possible. He also wrote novels, stories and poems. 
	Although Beckett's work is despairing, it is illuminated by black humour: 
	some of the two tramps' exchanges in <i>Godot </i>amount to an intellectual comic 
	patter, and the play overall has a strangely exhilarating effect.</font></td>

	The popular image of <b>Robert Frost </b>(1874&#8212; 1963) is of the poet of New 
	England, its birch trees and farmland, the heir of Wordsworth and the 
	Transcendentalists. His early poetry was published in old England, where he 
	lived with his family in 1912&#8212;15 after a period of profound depression 
	caused partly by the deaths of two children. He formed a close friendship 
	with the English poet, Edward Thomas, killed in the First World War, who 
	shared his love of the traditional and the colloquial. He subsequently 
	settled on a New Hampshire farm, though neither farm nor poetry absolved him 
	from the need to teach. By the time of <i>Collected Poems</i> (1930), Frost's 
	'woodland philosophy' &#8212; and the accessibility of his work &#8212; had made him an 
	American icon, but there was something deeper and darker in him. This 
	bitter, destructive element is more evident in the dramatic, blank-verse

	</font></i><br>
	<font size="2">Robert Lee Frost (March 26, 1874 &#8211; January 29, 1963) was an 
	American poet. He is highly regarded for his realistic depictions of the 
	rural life and his command of American colloquial speech. His work 
	frequently employed themes from the early 1900s rural life in New England, 
	using the setting to examine complex social and philosophical themes. A 
	popular and often-quoted poet, Frost was honored frequently during his 
	lifetime, receiving four Pulitzer Prizes. <br>
	</font></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although he is commonly 
	associated with New England, Robert Frost was a native of California, born 
	in San Francisco, and lived there until he was 11 years old. His mother, 
	Isabelle Moodie Frost, was of Scottish descent; his father, William Prescott 
	Frost, Jr., was a descendant of colonist Nicholas Frost from Tiverton, 
	Devon, England who had sailed to New Hampshire in 1634 on the Wolfrana. 
	Frost's father was a good teacher, and later an editor of the San Francisco 
	Evening Bulletin (which was eventually merged into the San Francisco 
	Examiner), and an unsuccessful candidate for the city tax collector. The 
	road not taken for young Robert might have been as a Californian editor 
	rather than a New England poet, but William Frost Jr. died May 5, 1885, 
	debts were settled, and the family moved to Lawrence, Massachusetts where 
	William Frost, Sr., was an overseer at a New England mill. Frost's mother 
	joined the Swedenborgian church and had him baptized in it, but he left it 
	as an adult. </font><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">Despite his later 
	association with rural life, Frost lived in the city, and published his 
	first poem in the Lawrence high school magazine. He attended Dartmouth 
	College, long enough to be accepted into the Theta Delta Chi fraternity. 
	Frost returned home to teach and to work at various jobs including 
	delivering newspapers and factory labor. He did not enjoy these jobs at all, 
	feeling his true calling as a poet.</font><br>
	</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1894 he sold his first poem, &quot;My 
	Butterfly: An Elegy&quot; (published in the November 8, 1894 edition of the New 
	York Independent) for fifteen dollars. Proud of this accomplishment, he 
	proposed marriage to Elinor Miriam White, but she refused, wanting to finish 
	college (at St. Lawrence University) before they married. Frost then went on 
	an excursion to the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia, and asked Elinor again 
	upon his return. Having graduated, she agreed, and they were married in 
	Harvard University, which he attended for two years. He did well, but left 
	to support his growing family. Grandfather Frost purchased a farm for the 
	young couple in Derry, New Hampshire, shortly before his death. Frost worked 
	on the farm for nine years. He wrote early in the mornings, producing many 
	of the poems that would later become famous. His attempts at farming were 
	not successful, and Frost returned to education as an English teacher at 
	Pinkerton Academy from 1906 to 1911, then at the New Hampshire Normal School 
	(now Plymouth State University) in Plymouth, New Hampshire. In 1912, Frost 
	sailed with his family to Great Britain, living first in Glasgow, before 
	settling in Beaconsfield, outside London. His first book of poetry, A Boy's 
	Will, was published the next year. In England he made some important 
	acquaintances, including Edward Thomas (a member of the group known as the 
	Dymock Poets), T.E. Hulme, and Ezra Pound. Pound would become the first 
	American to write a (favorable) review of Frost's work. Surrounded by his 
	peers, Frost wrote some of his best work while in England. As World War I 
	began, Frost returned to America in 1915. He bought a farm in Franconia, New 
	Hampshire, where he launched a career of writing, teaching, and lecturing. 
	The family homestead at Franconia, which served as his summer home until 
	1938, is maintained as a museum and poetry conference site. From 1916-20, 
	1923-24, and 1927-1938, Frost was an English professor at Amherst College, 
	encouraging his students to account for the sounds of the human voice in 
	their craft. Starting in 1921, and for the next 42 years (with three 
	exceptions), Frost spent his summers and into late fall teaching at the 
	Bread Loaf School of English of Middlebury College in Ripton, Vermont. The 
	college now owns and maintains Robert Frost's farm as a national historic 
	site near the Bread Loaf campus. From 1921-22, Frost moved to Ann Arbor to 
	accept a fellowship teaching at the University of Michigan.[2] In 1924, 
	Robert Frost accepted a lifetime appointment at the University of Michigan 
	in Ann Arbor as a Fellow in Letters where he resided until 1927.&nbsp; 
	Frost's Ann Arbor home is now at The Henry Ford. In January 1927, Frost 
	returned to Amherst. In 1940 Frost bought a five acre property in Coconut 
	Grove, Florida (which would later become South Miami). He called the place 
	Pencil Pines and spent the winters there for the rest of his life. Frost was 
	86 when he spoke at the inauguration of President Kennedy on January 20, 
	1961. He died a little more than two years later, from a blood clot in the 
	lungs. This was a chain reaction from a prostate surgery in December 1962. 
	He died in Boston, on January 29, 1963. He was buried at the Old Bennington 
	Cemetery in Bennington, Vermont. His epitaph reads, &quot;I had a lover's quarrel 
	with the world.&quot; Harvard's 1965 alumni directory indicates his having 
	received an honorary degree there; Frost also received honorary degrees from 
	Bates College and Oxford and Cambridge universities, and he was the first to 
	receive two honorary degrees from Dartmouth College. During his lifetime, 
	the Robert Frost Middle School in Fairfax, Virginia, as well as the main 
	library of Amherst College, were named after him. </font>
	<font face="Verdana"><font size="2">In the &quot;Anthology of Modern American 
	Poetry&quot;, published by Oxford University Press, Frost's poems are critiqued 
	and it is mentioned that behind their sometimes charmingly familiar and 
	rural façade, frequently lie pessimistic and menacing undertones which are 
	not often analyzed or recognized.</font><br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Robert Frost's personal life was 
	plagued with grief and loss. His father died of tuberculosis in 1885, when 
	Frost was 11, leaving the family with just $8. Frost's mother died of cancer 
	in 1900. In 1920, Frost had to commit his younger sister, Jeanie, to a 
	mental hospital, where she died nine years later. Mental illness apparently 
	ran in Frost's family, as both he and his mother suffered from depression, 
	and his daughter Irma was committed to a mental hospital in 1947. Frost's 
	wife, Elinor, also experienced bouts of depression.Elinor and Robert Frost 
	had six children: son Elliot (1896-1904, died of cholera), daughter Lesley 
	Frost Ballantine (1899-1983), son Carol (1902-1940, committed suicide), 
	daughter Irma (1903-?), daughter Marjorie (1905-1934, died as a result of 
	puerperal fever after childbirth), and daughter Elinor Bettina (died three 
	days after birth in 1907). Only Lesley and Irma outlived their father. 
	However, Frost had the unfortunate duty of committing Irma to a mental 
	hospital in 1947. Frost's wife, who had heart problems throughout her life, 
	developed breast cancer in 1937, and died of heart failure in 1938.</font></td>

	<b>Robert Lowell</b> (1917&#8212;77) also came from old New England stock, though

	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although the Silver Age may be said to have

	Lady&quot;, some scholars have extended its chronological framework to include 
	the works of the 1890s, starting with Nikolai Minsky's manifesto &quot;With the 
	light of conscience&quot; (1890), Dmitri Merezhkovsky's treatise &quot;About the 
	reasons for the decline of contemporary Russian literature&quot; (1893) and 
	Valery Bryusov's almanac &quot;Russian symbolists&quot; (1894). </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although the Silver Age was dominated by 
	the artistic movements of Russian Symbolism, Acmeism, and Russian Futurism, 
	there flourished innumerable other poetic schools, such as Mystical 
	Anarchism. There were also such poets as Ivan Bunin and <b>Marina Tsvetayeva</b> 
	who refused to align themselves with any of these movements. Alexander Blok 
	emerged as the leading poet, respected by virtually everyone. The poetic

	December 27, 1938) was a Russian poet and essayist, one of the foremost 
	members of the Acmeist school of poets. <br>
	<br>
	</font></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><br>
	Life and work<br>
	</b>Mandelstam was born in Warsaw to a wealthy Jewish family. His father, a 
	tanner by trade, was able to receive a dispensation freeing the family from 
	the pale of settlement, and soon after Osip's birth, they moved to Saint 
	Petersburg. In 1900, Mandelstam entered the prestigious Tenishevsky school, 
	which also counts Vladimir Nabokov and other significant figures of Russian 
	(and Soviet) culture among its alumni. His first poems were printed in the 
	school's almanac in 1907. In April 1908, Mandelstam decided to enter the 
	Sorbonne to study literature and philosophy, but he left the following year 
	to attend the University of Heidelberg. In 1911, in order to continue his 
	education at the University of Saint Petersburg, he converted to Methodism 
	(which he did not practice) and entered the university the same year. <br>
	Mandelstam's poetry, acutely populist in spirit after the first Russian 
	revolution, became closely associated with symbolist imagery, and in 1911, 
	he and several other young Russian poets formed the &quot;Poets' Guild&quot; (Russian:

	and Sergei Gorodetsky. The nucleus of this group would then become known as 
	Acmeists. Mandelstam had authored the manifesto for the new movement - The 
	Morning Of Acmeism (1913, published in 1919). 1913 also saw the publication 
	of his first collection of poems, The Stone (Russian: &#1050;&#1072;&#1084;&#1077;&#1085;&#1100;, Kamyen), to be 
	reissued in 1916 in a greatly expanded format, but under the same title.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1922, Mandelstam arrived in Moscow with 
	his newly-wed wife Nadezhda. At this time, his second book of poems, Tristia, 
	was published in Berlin. For several years after that, he almost completely 
	abandoned poetry, concentrating on essays, literary criticism, memoirs (The 
	Din Of Time, Russian: &#1064;&#1091;&#1084; &#1074;&#1088;&#1077;&#1084;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;, Shum vremeni; &#1060;&#1077;&#1086;&#1076;&#1086;&#1089;&#1080;&#1103;, Feodosiya - both 
	1925) and small-format prose (The Egyptian Stamp, Russian: &#1045;&#1075;&#1080;&#1087;&#1077;&#1090;&#1089;&#1082;&#1072;&#1103; &#1084;&#1072;&#1088;&#1082;&#1072;, 
	Yegipetskaya marka - 1928). As a day job, he translated (19 books in 6 
	years), then worked as a correspondent for the newspaper The Irish Times. 
	Mandelstam's non-conformist, anti-establishment tendencies always simmered 
	not far from the surface, and in the autumn of 1933, they broke through in 
	form of the famous &quot;Stalin Epigram&quot;. The poem, sharply criticizing the 
	&quot;Kremlin highlander&quot;, was described elsewhere as a &quot;sixteen line death 
	sentence,&quot; likely prompted by Mandelstam's seeing (in the summer of that 
	year, while vacationing in Crimea) the effects of the Great Famine, a result 
	of Stalin's collectivisation in the USSR and his drive to exterminate the 
	&quot;kulaks&quot;. Six months later, Mandelstam was arrested. <br>
	<br>
	However, after the customary pro forma inquest, he not only was spared his 
	life, but the sentence did not even include labor camps - a miraculous 
	event, usually explained by historians as owing to Stalin's personal 
	interest in his fate. Mandelstam was &quot;only&quot; exiled to Cherdyn in Northern 
	Ural with his wife. After his attempt to commit suicide, the sentence was 
	softened, and he was banished from the largest cities, but otherwise allowed 
	to choose his new place of residence. He and his wife chose Voronezh.<br>

			Akhmatova began writing verse at the age of 11 and at 21 became a 
			member of the Acmeist group of poets, whose leader, Nikolay Gumilyov, 
			she married in 1910 butdivorced in 1918. The Acmeists, through their 
			periodical Apollon (&#8220;Apollo&#8221;; 1909&#8211;17), rejected the esoteric 
			vagueness and affectations of Symbolism and sought to replace them 
			with &#8220;beautiful clarity,&#8221; compactness, simplicity, and perfection of 
			form&#8212;all qualities in which Akhmatova excelled from the outset. 
			Herfirst collections, Vecher (1912; &#8220;Evening&#8221;) and Chyotki (1914; 
			&#8220;Rosary&#8221;), especially the latter, brought her fame. While 
			exemplifying the best kind of personal or even confessional poetry, 
			they achieve a universal appeal deriving from their artistic and 
			emotional integrity. Akhmatova's principal motif is love, mainly 
			frustrated and tragic love, expressed with an intensely feminine 
			accent andinflection entirely her own.<br>
			Later in her life she added to her main theme some civic, patriotic, 
			and religious motifs but without sacrifice of personal intensity or 
			artistic conscience. Her artistry and increasing control of her 
			medium were particularly prominent in her next collections: Belaya 
			staya (1917; &#8220;The White Flock&#8221;), Podorozhnik (1921; &#8220;Plantain&#8221;), and 
			Anno Domini MCMXXI (1922). This amplification of her range, however, 
			did not prevent official Soviet critics from proclaiming her 
			&#8220;bourgeois and aristocratic,&#8221; condemning her poetry for its narrow 
			preoccupation with love and God, and characterizing her as half nun 
			and half harlot. The execution in 1921 of her former husband, 
			Gumilyov, on charges of participation in an anti-Soviet conspiracy 
			(the Tagantsev affair) further complicated her position. In 1923 she 
			entered a period of almost complete poetic silence and literary 
			ostracism, and no volume of her poetry was published in the Soviet 
			Union until 1940. In that year several of her poems were published 
			in the literary monthly Zvezda (&#8220;The Star&#8221;), and a volume of 
			selections from her earlier work appeared under the title Iz shesti 
			knig (&#8220;From Six Books&#8221;). A few months later, however, it was 
			abruptly withdrawn from sale and libraries. Nevertheless, in 
			September 1941, following the German invasion, Akhmatova was 
			permitted to deliver an inspiring radio address to the women of 
			Leningrad [St. Petersburg]. Evacuated to Tashkent soon thereafter, 
			she read her poems to hospitalized soldiers and published a number 
			of war-inspired lyrics; a small volume of selected lyrics appeared 
			in Tashkent in 1943. At the end of the war she returned to 
			Leningrad, where her poems began to appear in local magazines and 
			newspapers. She gave poetic readings, and plans were made for 
			publication of a large edition of her works.<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
			In August 1946, however, she was harshly denounced by the Central 
			Committee of the Communist Party for her &#8220;eroticism, mysticism, and 
			political indifference.&#8221; Her poetrywas castigated as &#8220;alien to the 
			Soviet people,&#8221; and she was again described as a &#8220;harlot-nun,&#8221; this 
			time by none other than Andrey Zhdanov, Politburo member and the 
			director of Stalin's program of cultural restriction. She was 
			expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers; an unreleased book of her 
			poems, already in print, was destroyed; and none of her workappeared 
			in print for three years.<br>
			Then, in 1950, a number of her poems eulogizing Stalin and Soviet 
			communism were printed in several issues of the illustrated weekly 
			magazine Ogonyok (&#8220;The Little Light&#8221;) under the title Iz tsikla 
			&#8220;Slava miru&#8221; (&#8220;From the Cycle &#8216;Glory to Peace' &#8221;). This 
			uncharacteristic capitulation to the Soviet dictator&#8212;in one of the 
			poems Akhmatova declares: &#8220;WhereStalin is, there is Freedom, Peace, 
			and the grandeur of the earth&#8221;&#8212;was motivated by Akhmatova's desire 
			to propitiateStalin and win the freedom of her son, Lev Gumilyov, 
			who had been arrested in 1949 and exiled to Siberia. The tone of 
			these poems (those glorifying Stalin were omitted from Soviet 
			editions of Akhmatova's works published after his death) is far 
			different from the moving and universalized lyrical cycle, Rekviem 
			(&#8220;Requiem&#8221;), composed between 1935 and 1940 and occasioned by 
			Akhmatova's grief over an earlier arrest and imprisonment of her son 
			in 1937. This masterpiece&#8212;a poetic monument to the sufferings of the 
			Soviet peoples during Stalin's terror&#8212;was published in Moscow in 
			1989.<br>
	<br>

	<br>
			In the cultural &#8220;thaw&#8221; following Stalin's death, Akhmatova was 
			slowly and ambivalently rehabilitated, and a slim volume of her 
			lyrics, including some of her translations, was published in 1958. 
			After 1958 a number of editions of her works, including some of her 
			brilliant essays on Pushkin, were published in the Soviet Union 
			(1961, 1965, two in 1976, 1977); none of these, however, contains 
			the complete corpus of her literary productivity. Akhmatova's 
			longest work, Poema bez geroya (&#8220;Poem Without a Hero&#8221;), on which she 
			worked from 1940 to 1962, was not published in the Soviet Union 
			until 1976. This difficult and complex work is a powerful lyric 
			summation of Akhmatova's philosophy and her own definitive statement 
			on the meaning of her life and poetic achievement.<br>
			Akhmatova executed a number of superb translations of the works of 
			other poets, including Victor Hugo, Rabindranath Tagore, Giacomo 
			Leopardi, and various Armenian and Korean poets. She also wrote 
			sensitive personal memoirs on Symbolist writer Aleksandr Blok, the 
			artist Amedeo Modigliani, and fellow Acmeist Osip Mandelshtam.<br>
			In 1964 she was awarded the Etna-Taormina prize, an international 
			poetry prize awarded in Italy, and in 1965 she received an honorary 
			doctoral degree from Oxford University. Her journeys to Sicily and 
			England to receive these honours were her first travel outside her 
			homeland since 1912. Akhmatova's works were widely translated, 
			andher international stature continued to grow after her death. Atwo-volume 
			edition of Akhmatova's collected works was published in Moscow in 
			1986, and The Complete Poems of Anna Akhmatova, also in two volumes, 
			appeared in 1990.<br>

	<font size="2">Boris Leonidovich Pasternak (Russian: &#1041;&#1086;&#1088;&#1080;&#769;&#1089; &#1051;&#1077;&#1086;&#1085;&#1080;&#769;&#1076;&#1086;&#1074;&#1080;&#1095; 
	&#1055;&#1072;&#1089;&#1090;&#1077;&#1088;&#1085;&#1072;&#769;&#1082;) (February 10 [O.S. January 29] 1890 &#8212; May 30, 1960) was a Nobel 
	Prize-winning Russian poet and writer, in the West best known for his epic 
	novel Doctor Zhivago. The novel is a tragedy, whose events span through the 
	last period of Tsarist Russia and early days of Soviet Union, and was first 
	translated and published in Italy in 1957. In Russia, however, Boris 
	Pasternak is most celebrated as a poet. My Sister Life, written in 1917, is 
	arguably the most influential collection of poetry published in Russian 
	language in the 20th century. <br>
	Pasternak was born in Moscow on February 10, (Gregorian), 1890 (Julian 
	January 29) into a Jewish family. His father was a prominent painter, Leonid 
	Pasternak, professor at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and 
	Architecture and his mother was Rosa (Raitza) Kaufman, a concert pianist. 
	Pasternak was brought up in a highly cosmopolitan atmosphere, and visitors 
	to his home included pianist and composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, poet Rainer 
	Maria Rilke, and writer Leo Tolstoy. Inspired by his neighbour Alexander 
	Scriabin, Pasternak resolved to become a composer and entered the Moscow 
	Conservatory. In 1910 he abruptly left the conservatory for the University 
	of Marburg, where he studied under Neo-Kantian philosophers Hermann Cohen 
	and Nicolai Hartmann. Although invited to become a scholar, he decided 
	against making philosophy a profession and returned to Moscow in 1914. His 
	first poetry collection, influenced by Alexander Blok and the Russian 
	Futurists, was published later the same year. Pasternak's early verse 
	cleverly dissimulates his preoccupation with Kant's ideas. Its fabric 
	includes striking alliterations, wild rhythmic combinations, day-to-day 
	vocabulary, and hidden allusions to his favourite poets like Rilke, 
	Lermontov and German Romantic poets. During the First World War , he taught 
	and worked at a chemical factory in Vsevolodovo-Vilve (Perm gubernia, near 
	Perm), which undoubtedly provided him with material for Dr. Zhivago many 
	years later. Unlike many of his relatives and friends, Pasternak did not 
	leave Russia after the revolution. Instead, he was fascinated with the new 
	ideas and possibilities that revolution brought to life.<br>
	Pasternak spent the summer of 1917 living in the steppe country near Saratov, 
	where he fell in love. This passion resulted in the collection My Sister 
	Life, which he wrote over a period of three months, but was too embarrassed 
	to publish for four years because of its novel style. When it finally was 
	published in 1921, the book revolutionised Russian poetry. It made Pasternak 
	the model for younger poets, and decisively changed the poetry of Osip 
	Mandelshtam, Marina Tsvetayeva and others. Following My Sister Life, 
	Pasternak produced some hermetic pieces of uneven quality, including his 
	masterpiece - the lyric cycle entitled Rupture (1921). Authors such as 
	Vladimir Mayakovsky, Andrey Bely, and Vladimir Nabokov applauded Pasternak's 
	poems as works of pure, unbridled inspiration. In the late 1920s, he also 
	participated in the much celebrated tripartite correspondence with Rilke and 
	Tsvetayeva.<br>
	By the end of the 1920s, Pasternak increasingly felt that his colourful 
	modernist style was at odds with the doctrine of Socialist Realism approved 
	by the Communist party. He attempted to make his poetry more comprehensible 
	to the masses by reworking his earlier pieces and starting two lengthy poems 
	on the Russian Revolution. He also turned to prose and wrote several 
	autobiographical stories, notably The Childhood of Lovers and Safe Conduct.<br>
	By 1932, Pasternak had strikingly reshaped his style to make it acceptable 
	to the Soviet public and printed the new collection of poems aptly entitled 
	The Second Birth. Although its Caucasian pieces were as brilliant as the 
	earlier efforts, the book alienated the core of Pasternak's refined audience 
	abroad. He simplified his style even further for his next collection of 
	patriotic verse, Early Trains (1943), which prompted Nabokov to describe 
	Pasternak as a &quot;weeping Bolshevik&quot; and &quot;Emily Dickinson in trousers.&quot; During 
	the great purges of the later 1930s, Pasternak became progressively 
	disillusioned with Communist ideals. Reluctant to publish his own poetry, he 
	turned to translating Shakespeare (Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear), Goethe 
	(Faust), Rilke (Requiem für eine Freundin), Paul Verlaine, and Georgian 
	poets. Pasternak's translations of Shakespeare have proved popular with the 
	Russian public because of their colloquial, modernised dialogues, but 
	critics accused him of &quot;pasternakizing&quot; the English playwright. Although he 
	was widely panned for excessive subjectivism, Stalin is said to have crossed 
	Pasternak's name off an arrest list during the purges, saying &quot;Don't touch 
	this cloud dweller.&quot;[citation needed]Another version of Stalin's remark, 
	possibly on a separate occasion, is &quot;Leave that Holy Fool alone!&quot; His 
	cousin, Polish poet Leon Pasternak was not so lucky. As a result of his 
	political activities in Poland &#8212; writing satirical verses for socialist 
	revolutionary periodicals - he was imprisoned in 1934 in the Bereza Kartuska 
	detention camp.<br>
	<br>
	Several years before the start of the Second World War, Pasternak and his 
	wife settled in Peredelkino, a village for writers several miles from 
	Moscow. He was filled with a love of life that gave his poetry a hopeful 
	tone. This is reflected in the name of his autobiographical hero Zhivago, 
	derived from the Russian word for live. Another famous character, Lara, is 
	said to have been modeled on his mistress, Olga Ivinskaya.As the book was 
	frowned upon by the Soviet authorities, Doctor Zhivago was smuggled abroad 
	by his friend Isaiah Berlin and published in an Italian translation by the 
	Italian publishing house Feltrinelli in 1957. The novel became an instant 
	sensation, and was subsequently translated and published in many non-Soviet 
	bloc countries. In 1958 and 1959, the American edition spent 26 weeks at the 
	top of The New York Times' bestseller list. Although none of his Soviet 
	critics had the chance to read the proscribed novel, some of them publicly 
	demanded, &quot;kick the pig out of our kitchen-garden,&quot; i.e., expel Pasternak 
	from the USSR. This led to a jocular Russian saying used to poke fun at 
	illiterate criticism, &quot;I did not read Pasternak, but I condemn him&quot;. Doctor 
	Zhivago was eventually published in the USSR in 1988.The screen adaptation, 
	directed by David Lean, was of epic proportions, being toured in the 
	roadshow tradition, and starred Omar Sharif and Julie Christie. 
	Concentrating on the romantic aspects of the tale, it quickly became a 
	worldwide blockbuster, but wasn't released in Russia until near the time of 
	the fall of the Soviet Union.<br>
	<br>
	Pasternak was named the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958. On 
	October 25, two days after hearing that he had won, Pasternak sent the 
	following telegram to the Swedish Academy: </font></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Immensely thankful, touched, proud, 
	astonished, abashed. <br>
	However, four days later came another telegram: Considering the meaning this 
	award has been given in the society to which I belong, I must refuse it. 
	Please do not take offense at my voluntary rejection. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Swedish Academy announced: </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This refusal, of course, in no way alters 
	the validity of the award. There remains only for the Academy, however, to 
	announce with regret that the presentation of the Prize cannot take place.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reading between the lines of Pasternak's 
	second telegram, it is clear he declined the award out of fear that he would 
	be stripped of his citizenship were he to travel to Stockholm to accept it. 
	After struggling a lifetime to avoid leaving Russia, this was not a prospect 
	he welcomed. Despite turning down the Nobel Prize, Soviet officials soured 
	on Pasternak, and he was threatened at the very least with expulsion. 
	However, it appears that the Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, may also 
	have spoken with Khrushchev about this, and Pasternak was not exiled or 
	imprisoned. Despite this, a famous Bill Mauldin cartoon at the time showed 
	Pasternak and another prisoner in Siberia, splitting trees in the snow. In 
	the caption, Pasternak says, &quot;I won the Nobel Prize for literature. What was 
	your crime?&quot; The cartoon won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 
	1959.The Nobel medal was finally presented to Pasternak's son, Yevgeny, at a 
	ceremony in Stockholm during the Nobel week of December 1989. At the 
	ceremony, the Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich played a Bach serenade 
	to honor his deceased countryman.<br>
	<br>
	Pasternak's post-Zhivago poetry probes the universal questions of love, 
	immortality, and reconciliation with God.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pasternak died of lung cancer on May 30, 
	1960. Despite only a small notice appearing in the Literary Gazette, 
	thousands of people traveled from Moscow to his funeral in Peredelkino. 
	&quot;Volunteers carried his open coffin to his burial place and those who were 
	present (including the poet Andrey Voznesensky) recited from memory the 
	banned poem 'Hamlet'.&quot; The poet and bard Alexander Galich wrote a 
	politically charged song dedicated to his memory. </font></td>

	<font size="2">Joseph Brodsky (May 24, 1940&#8212;January 28, 1996), born Iosif 
	Aleksandrovich Brodsky (Russian: &#1048;&#1086;&#769;&#1089;&#1080;&#1092; &#1040;&#1083;&#1077;&#1082;&#1089;&#1072;&#769;&#1085;&#1076;&#1088;&#1086;&#1074;&#1080;&#1095; &#1041;&#1088;&#1086;&#769;&#1076;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1081;) was a 
	Russian poet and essayist who won the Nobel Prize in Literature (1987) and 
	was chosen Poet Laureate of the United States (1991-1992). He had an 
	honorary degree from Yale and University of Silesia and was an honorary 
	member of the International Academy of Science. <br>
&nbsp;</font></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In the Soviet Union<br>
	</b>Brodsky was born into a Jewish family in Leningrad, the son of a 
	professional photographer in the Soviet Navy. In early childhood he survived 
	the Siege of Leningrad. When he was fifteen, Brodsky left school and tried 
	to enter the School of Submariners (&#1096;&#1082;&#1086;&#1083;&#1072; &#1087;&#1086;&#1076;&#1074;&#1086;&#1076;&#1085;&#1080;&#1082;&#1086;&#1074;) without success. He 
	went on to work as a milling machine operator (&#1092;&#1088;&#1077;&#1079;&#1077;&#1088;&#1086;&#1074;&#1097;&#1080;&#1082;) at a plant. 
	Later, having decided to become a physician, he worked at a morgue at the 
	Kresty prison. He subsequently held a variety of jobs at a hospital, in a 
	ship's boiler room, and on geological expeditions. At the same time, Brodsky 
	engaged in a program of self-education. He learned English and Polish 
	(mainly to translate poems by Czes&#322;aw Mi&#322;osz, who was Brodsky's favourite 
	poet and a friend), and acquired a deep interest in classical philosophy, 
	religion, mythology, and English and American poetry. Later in life, he 
	admitted that he picked up books from anywhere he could find them, including 
	even garbage dumps. Brodsky began writing his own poetry and producing 
	literary translations around 1957. His writings were apolitical. The young 
	Brodsky was encouraged and influenced by the poet Anna Akhmatova who called 
	some of his verses &quot;enchanting.&quot; He had no degree in the liberal arts.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1963, he was arrested and in 1964 
	charged with parasitism (&quot;&#1090;&#1091;&#1085;&#1077;&#1103;&#1076;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1086;&quot;) by the Soviet authorities. A famous 
	excerpt from the transcript of his trial made by journalist Frida Vigdorova 
	was smuggled to the West: </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">Judge: And what is your profession, 
	in general? <br>
	Brodsky: I am a poet and a literary translator. <br>
	Judge: Who recognizes you as a poet? Who enrolled you in the ranks of poets?
	<br>
	Brodsky: No one. Who enrolled me in the ranks of humankind? <br>
	Judge: Did you study this? <br>
	Brodsky: This? <br>
	Judge: How to become a poet. You did not even try to finish high school 
	where they prepare, where they teach? <br>
	Brodsky: I didn&#8217;t think you could get this from school. <br>
	Judge: How then? <br>
	Brodsky: I think that it ... comes from God.</font><br>
	<font size="2">For his &quot;parasitism&quot; Brodsky was sentenced to five years of 
	internal exile with obligatory engagement in physical work and served 18 
	months in Archangelsk region. The sentence was commuted in 1965 after 
	prominent Soviet and foreign literary figures, such as Evgeny 
	Evtushenko[citation needed], Dmitri Shostakovich and Jean Paul Sartre, 
	protested. </font></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1964, Leonid Brezhnev came to power. As 
	the Khrushchev Thaw period ended, only four of Brodsky's poems were 
	published in the Soviet Union. He refused to publish his writings censored 
	and most of his work has appeared only in the West or in samizdat. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In the United States<br>
	</b>On June 4, 1972, Brodsky was expelled from the USSR. He became a U.S. 
	citizen in 1977. His first teaching position in the United States was at the 
	University of Michigan (U-M). He was Poet-in-Residence and Visiting 
	Professor at Queens College, Smith College, Columbia University, and the 
	Cambridge University in England. He was a Five-College Professor of 
	Literature at Mount Holyoke College. He achieved major successes in his 
	career as an English language poet and essayist. In 1978, Brodsky was 
	awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters at Yale University, and on 
	May 23, 1979, he was inducted as a member of the American Academy and 
	Institute of Arts and Letters. In 1981, Brodsky received the John D. and 
	Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's &quot;genius&quot; award. He is also a recipient 
	of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. In 1986, his 
	collection of essays Less Than One won the National Book Critic's Award for 
	Criticism. In 1987, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, being the fifth 
	Russian-born writer to do so. At an interview in Stockholm airport, to a 
	question: &quot;You are an American citizen who is receiving the Prize for 
	Russian-language poetry. Who are you, an American or a Russian?&quot;, he 
	responded: &quot;I am Jewish - a Russian poet and an English essayist&quot;.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1991, Brodsky became Poet Laureate of 
	the United States. His inauguration address was printed in Poetry Review. He 
	married Maria Sozzani in 1990. They had one daughter. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Grave of Brodsky in San Michele. Brodsky 
	died of a heart attack in his New York City apartment on January 28, 1996, 
	and was buried in the Episcopalian section at Isola di San Michele cemetery

	</b>The novels of <b>Franz Kafka</b> (1883-1924) are 'political' largely in 
	retrospect. The real subject of his unsettling tales is the alienation of 
	the individual in a hostile, uncomprehending, inexplicable world. A 
	German-speaking Jew from Prague, tubercular and mentally troubled, he was 
	hardly known in his lifetime, his three novels and most of his short stones 
	being published posthumously through his friend and executor, Max Brod, who 
	disregarded Kafka's suggestion that they should be burned. Kafka's novels. 
	<i>The Trial</i> (1925), <i>The Castle</i> (1926) and <i>Amerika</i> (1927), are fragmentary, and 
	the last is unfinished. I he first sentence of the I mil suggests the flavour: 'Someone must have slandered Joseph K. because, one morning, 
	without his having done anything wrong, he was arrested.&quot; The central 
	character, whose surname is never elucidated, is persecuted and eventually 
	executed by various incomprehensible agencies working on behalf of a

	complexities, the sinister absurdities, the oppressive atmosphere of intense 
	anxiety that characterize Kafka's decidedly unsettling world are described, 
	astonishingly, in pearl-like language, lucid and concise.<br>

	</b>Old Etonian and veteran of the Burma Police, <b>George Orwell</b> (1903-50) 
	acknowledged that he was not a true novelist. A gifted journalist and 
	essayist, he was inspired by hatred of political injustice, and the novel 
	sometimes proved the most suitable means to express it. Among his best books 
	are his factual account of unemployment in the north of England, <i>The Road to Wigan Pier 
	</i>(1937), and his account of his experiences as a Republican 
	volunteer in the Spanish Civil War, <i>Homage to Catalonia</i> (1938), but he is 
	chiefly remembered for two works of fiction.<br>
	A socialist but a democrat, Orwell's target in both <i>Animal Farm</i> (1945) and 
	<i>Nineteen Eighty-Four </i>(1949) is Soviet totalitarianism. Animal Farm belongs 
	to that select group of parables that can be read as a children's story. The 
	farm animals rebel against the exploitative farmer and set up a republic in 
	which 'All animals are equal'. The popular revolution is taken over by the 
	pigs, led by Napoleon, the other animals are subjected to still worse 
	suppression, and to their democratic slogan is added '. . . but some animals 
	are more equal than others'. <i>Nineteen Fighty-Four</i> is a dystopia of a 
	futuristic totalitarian state. owing something to Koestler, in which the 
	Party rewrites history and the dictionary in its efforts to control the very 
	thoughts of the people, who are watched over by the ubiquitous image of Big 
	Brother. The Cold War made it seen: all the more topical, but Orwell's tour

	AGAINST STALIN|<br>
	<br>
	</b>The relationship between the writer and the state is the - hidden - 
	subject of <b>Mikhail Bulgakov</b>'s masterpiece <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, written 
	in the 1930s, published in 1966. Stalin and his colleagues drew no 
	distinction between literature and propaganda. The sign of literary worth 
	was expulsion from, not admission to, the Writers' Union. After Stalin's 
	death, the Party's attitude see-sawed. <b>Boris Pasternak</b> thought he could get 
	away with <i>Doctor Zhivago</i> (published abroad in 1957, written earlier). It 
	earned him a Nobel Prize, but the outraged authorities refused to allow him 
	out of the country to receive it.<br>
	Under Khrushchev, it was possible to publish <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovieh
	</i>(1962), which exposed the horror of the Stalinist prison camps. 
	The author was the then-unknown <b>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</b> (born 1918), who 
	became a thorn in the side of the more repressive Brezhnev regime. In 1965 
	the writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuh Daniel were sentenced to hard labour 
	for publishing abroad, but the days of the terror were over: people were 
	less easily intimidated, protests grew, and a stream of writers moved to the 
	West, including, much against his will, the heroically Russian Solzhenitsyn 
	in 1974. Some sort of a literary nadir was reached with the award of the top 
	literary prize to Brezhnev himself, for his memoirs. The long-overdue 
	collapse of the system in the late 1980s, in Russia and in the other 
	countries that had languished under the Stalinist yoke since the 1940s, 
	brought artistic freedom, but also the problem, similar to that faced by 
	armies after the end of a war, of motivation. Returning to his beloved 
	homeland from alien exile, rumbling now against Western materialism, 
	Solzhenitsyn seemed a figure from a completely different age.</font></td>

	Mikhail Afanasievich Bulgakov (Russian: &#1052;&#1080;&#1093;&#1072;&#1080;&#1083; &#1040;&#1092;&#1072;&#1085;&#1072;&#1089;&#1100;&#1077;&#1074;&#1080;&#1095; &#1041;&#1091;&#1083;&#1075;&#1072;&#1082;&#1086;&#1074;, May 15 
	[O.S. May 3] 1891, Kiev &#8211; March 10, 1940, Moscow) was a Russian novelist and 
	playwright active in the first half of the 20th century. He is best known 
	for the novel The Master and Margarita, which the New York Times Book Review 
	has called one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century.<br>
	Mikhail Bulgakov was born to Russian parents on May 15, 1891 in Kiev, 
	Ukraine (which at the time was part of the Russian Empire). He was the 
	oldest son of Afanasiy Bulgakov, an assistant professor at the Kiev 
	Theological Academy. He was the grandson of priests on both sides of the 
	family. From 1901 to 1904, Mikhail attended the First Kiev Gymnasium, where 
	he developed an interest in Russian and European literature. In 1913 
	Bulgakov married Tatiana Lappa. At the outbreak of the First World War he 
	volunteered with the Red Cross. In 1916, he graduated from the Medical 
	School of Kiev University and then served in the White Army. He briefly 
	served in the Ukrainian People's Army. His brothers also served in the White 
	Army. After the Civil War and rise of the Soviets, they emigrated to exile 
	in Paris. Mikhail, who had enlisted in the White Army as a field doctor, 
	ended up in the Caucasus. There he began to work as a journalist. In 1919 he 
	decided to leave medicine to pursue his love of literature. In 1921, he 
	moved with Tatiana to Moscow where he began his career as a writer. Three 
	years later, divorced from his first wife, he married Lyubov' Belozerskaya. 
	He published a number of works through the early and mid 1920s, but by 1927 
	his career began to suffer from criticism that he was too anti-Soviet. By 
	1929 his career was ruined, and government censorship prevented publication 
	of any of his work. In 1931, Bulgakov married for the third time, to Yelena 
	Shilovskaya, who would prove to be inspiration for the character Margarita 
	in his most famous novel. They settled at Patriarch's Ponds. During the last 
	decade of his life, Bulgakov continued to work on The Master and Margarita, 
	wrote plays, critical works, stories, and made several translations and 
	dramatisations of novels, but none were published. Bulgakov never supported 
	the Soviet regime, and mocked it in many of his works. Therefore, most of 
	his work stayed in his desk drawer for several decades. In 1930 he wrote a 
	letter to the Soviet government, requesting permission to emigrate if the 
	Soviet Union could not find use for him as a satirist. He received a 
	personal phone call from Stalin himself, who asked Bulgakov if he truly 
	desired to leave the country. Bulgakov replied that a Russian writer could 
	not live outside of his homeland. Stalin had enjoyed Bulgakov's work, The 
	Days of the Turbins and found work for him at a small Moscow theatre, and 
	then the Moscow Art Theatre. In Bulgakov's autobiography, he claimed that he 
	wrote to Stalin out of desperation and mental anguish, never intending to 
	post the letter. Bulgakov wrote letters to Stalin during the 1930s again 
	requesting to emigrate, to which Stalin did not reply. The refusal of the 
	authorities to let him work in the theatre and his desire to see his family 
	living abroad, whom he had not seen for many years, led him to seek drastic 
	measures. Despite his new work, the projects he worked on at the theatre 
	were unsuccessful and he was stressed and unhappy. He also worked briefly at 
	the Bolshoi Theatre as a librettist but left when his works were not 
	produced. </font></p>

	inherited kidney disorder) on March 10, 1940. He was buried in the 
	Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. His father had died of the same disease.<br>

	</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">During his life, Bulgakov was best known 
	for the plays he contributed to Konstantin Stanislavsky's Moscow Art 
	Theatre. Stalin was known to be fond of the play Days of the Turbins (&#1044;&#1085;&#1080; 
	&#1058;&#1091;&#1088;&#1073;&#1080;&#1085;&#1099;&#1093;) (1926), which was based on Bulgakov's novel The White Guard. His 
	dramatization of Molière's life in The Cabal of Hypocrites (&#1050;&#1072;&#1073;&#1072;&#1083;&#1072; &#1089;&#1074;&#1103;&#1090;&#1086;&#1096;) 
	is still performed by the Moscow Art Theatre. Even after his plays were 
	banned from the theatres, Bulgakov wrote a black comedy about Ivan the 
	Terrible's visit into 1930s Moscow and a play about the early years of 
	Stalin (1939), which was prohibited by Stalin himself. Bulgakov began 
	writing prose with The White Guard (&#1041;&#1077;&#1083;&#1072;&#1103; &#1075;&#1074;&#1072;&#1088;&#1076;&#1080;&#1103;) (1924, published in 1966) 
	- a novel about a life of a White Army officer's family in Civil war Kiev, 
	and a short story collection entitled Notes of a Young Doctor (&#1047;&#1072;&#1087;&#1080;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080; &#1102;&#1085;&#1086;&#1075;&#1086; 
	&#1074;&#1088;&#1072;&#1095;&#1072;), based on Bulgakov's work as a country doctor in 1916&#8211;1919. In the 
	mid-1920s, he came to admire the works of H. G. Wells and wrote several 
	stories with elements of science fiction, notably The Fatal Eggs (&#1056;&#1086;&#1082;&#1086;&#1074;&#1099;&#1077; 
	&#1103;&#1081;&#1094;&#1072;) (1924) and the Heart of a Dog (&#1057;&#1086;&#1073;&#1072;&#1095;&#1100;&#1077; &#1089;&#1077;&#1088;&#1076;&#1094;&#1077;) (1925). The Fatal Eggs 
	tells of the events of a Professor Persikov, who in experimentation with 
	eggs, discovers a red ray that accelerates growth in living organisms. At 
	the time, an illness passes through the chickens of Moscow, killing most of 
	them and, to remedy the situation, the Soviet government puts the ray into 
	use at a farm. Unfortunately there is a mix up in egg shipments and the 
	Professor ends up with chicken eggs, while the government-run farm receives 
	the shipment of ostrich, snake and crocodile eggs that were meant to go to 
	the Professor. The mistake is not discovered until the eggs produce giant 
	monstrosities that wreak havoc in the suburbs of Moscow and kill most of the 
	workers on the farm. The propaganda machine then turns on Persikov, 
	distorting his nature in the same way his &quot;innocent&quot; tampering created the 
	monsters. This tale of a bungling government earned Bulgakov his label of a 
	counter-revolutionary. Heart of a Dog features a professor who implants 
	human testicles and pituitary gland into a dog named Sharik (means &quot;Little 
	Balloon&quot; or &quot;Little Ball&quot; - popular Russian nickname for a male dog). The 
	dog then proceeds to become more and more human as time passes, resulting in 
	all manner of chaos. The tale can be read as a critical satire of the Soviet 
	Union; it contains few bold hints to communist leadership (e.g. the name of 
	donor drunkard of human implants is Chugunkin (&quot;chugun&quot; is a cast iron) 
	which can be seen as parody on the name of Stalin (&quot;stal'&quot; is steel). It was 
	turned into a comic opera called The Murder of Comrade Sharik by William 
	Bergsma in 1973. In 1988 an award-winning movie version Sobachye Serdtse was 
	produced by Lenfilm, starring Yevgeniy Yevstigneyev, Roman Kartsev and 
	Vladimir Tolokonnikov.<br>

	</b>The Master and Margarita (&#1052;&#1072;&#1089;&#1090;&#1077;&#1088; &#1080; &#1052;&#1072;&#1088;&#1075;&#1072;&#1088;&#1080;&#1090;&#1072;), which Bulgakov began 
	writing in 1928, is a fantasy satirical novel published twenty-six years 
	after his death in 1966 by his wife, that has led to an international 
	appreciation of his work. The book was available underground as samizdat for 
	many years in the Soviet Union, before the serialization of a censored 
	version in the journal Moskva. It contributed a number of sayings to the 
	Russian language, for example, &quot;Manuscripts don't burn&quot; and &quot;second-grade 
	fresh&quot;. A destroyed manuscript of the Master is an important element of the 
	plot, and in fact Bulgakov had to rewrite the novel from memory after he 
	burned the draft manuscript of this novel. The novel is a multilayered 
	critique of the Soviet society in general and its literary establishment. It 
	is a frame narrative involving two characteristically related time periods 
	and/or plot lines; the retelling of the gospels, and describing contemporary 
	Moscow. The novel begins with Satan's visiting Moscow in the 1920s or 30s, 
	joining a conversation of a critic and a poet, busily debating the existence 
	of Jesus Christ and the Devil. It then evolves into an all-embracing 
	indictment of the corruption, greed, narrow-mindedness, and widespread 
	paranoia of Soviet Russia. Banned but widely read, the novel firmly secured 
	Bulgakov's place among the pantheon of great Russian writers.</font><font face="Verdana"><br>

	<font size="2">Aleksandr Isaevich Solzhenitsyn (born December 11, 1918) is a 
	Russian novelist, dramatist and historian. Through his writings, he made the 
	world aware of the Gulag, the Soviet labour camp system, and, for these 
	efforts, Solzhenitsyn was both awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970 
	and exiled from the Soviet Union in 1974. He returned to Russia in 1994. 
	That year, he was elected as a member of Serbian Academy of Sciences and 
	Arts in the Department of Language and Literature. He is the father of Ignat 
	Solzhenitsyn, a well-known conductor and pianist. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>&nbsp;While in the Soviet Union<br>
	</b>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was born in Kislovodsk, Russia, the son of a 
	young widowed mother, Taisia Solzhenitsyna (née Scherbak), whose father had 
	risen, it seems, from humble beginnings, much of a self-made man, and 
	acquired a large estate in the Kuban region by the northern foothills of the 
	Caucasus. During World War I, Taisia went to Moscow to study. While there 
	she met Isaaky Solzhenitsyn, a young army officer, also from the Caucasus 
	region (the family background of his parents is vividly brought alive in the 
	opening chapters of August 1914, and later on in the Red Wheel novel cycle). 
	In 1918, Taisia became pregnant with Aleksandr. Soon after this was 
	confirmed, Isaaky was killed in a hunting accident. Aleksandr, who had three 
	brothers and a sister, was raised by his mother and aunt in lowly 
	circumstances; his earliest years coincided with the Russian Civil War and 
	by 1930 the family property had been turned into a kolkhoz. Solzhenitsyn has 
	stated his mother was fighting for survival and they had to keep his 
	father's background in the old Imperial Army a secret. His educated mother 
	(who never remarried) encouraged his literary and scientific leanings, also 
	raising him in the Russian Orthodox faith; she died shortly before 1940. On 
	7 April 1940, he married chemistry student Natalya Alekseevna Reshetovskaya, 
	whom he divorced in 1952 (a year before his release from the Gulag), 
	remarried in 1957 and divorced again in 1972, the following year marrying 
	Natalya Dmitrievna Svetlova, a mathematician who had a son from a brief 
	prior marriage. He and Svetlova (b. 1939) had three sons: Yermolai (1970), 
	Ignat (1972) and Stepan (1973).</font></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Solzhenitsyn 
	studied mathematics at Rostov State University, while at the same time 
	taking correspondence courses from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, 
	Literature, and History (at this time heavily ideological in scope; as he 
	himself makes clear, he did not question the state ideology or the 
	superiority of the Soviet Union before he had spent some time in the camps). 
	During World War II, he served as the commander of an artillery position 
	finding company in the Red Army, was involved in major action at the front, 
	and was twice decorated. In February 1945, while serving in East Prussia, he 
	was arrested for writing a derogatory comment in a letter to a friend, N. D. 
	Utkevich, about the conduct of the war by Joseph Stalin, whom he called &quot;the 
	whiskered one&quot;, &quot;Khozyain&quot; (The Master) and &quot;Balabos&quot;, (Odessa Yiddish for 
	&quot;boss&quot;). He was accused of anti-Soviet propaganda under Article 58 of the 
	Soviet criminal code, paragraph 10, and of &quot;founding a hostile organisation&quot; 
	under paragraph 11. Solzhenitsyn was taken to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, 
	where he was beaten and interrogated. On 7 July 1945, he was sentenced in 
	his absence by a three-man tribunal of the Soviet security police (NKGB) to 
	an eight-year term in a labour camp, to be followed by permanent internal 
	exile. This was the normal sentence for most crimes under Article 58 at the 
	time.The first part of Solzhenitsyn's sentence was served in several 
	different work camps; the &quot;middle phase,&quot; as he later referred to it, was 
	spent in a sharashka, special scientific research facilities run by Ministry 
	of State Security: these formed the experiences distilled in The First 
	Circle, published in the West in 1968. In 1950, he was sent to a &quot;Special 
	Camp&quot; for political prisoners. During his imprisonment at the camp in the 
	town of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan, he worked as a miner, bricklayer, and 
	foundryman. His experiences at Ekibastuz formed the basis for the book One 
	Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. While there he had a tumor removed, 
	although his cancer was not then diagnosed. From March 1953, Solzhenitsyn 
	began a sentence of internal exile for life at Kok-Terek in southern 
	Kazakhstan. His undiagnosed cancer spread, until, by the end of the year, he 
	was close to death. However, in 1954, he was permitted to be treated in a 
	hospital in Tashkent, where he was cured. These experiences became the basis 
	of his novel Cancer Ward and also found an echo in the short story &quot;The 
	right hand&quot;. It was during this decade of imprisonment and exile that 
	Solzhenitsyn abandoned Marxism and developed the philosophical and religious 
	positions of his later life; this turn has some interesting parallel streaks 
	to Dostoevsky's time in Siberia and his quest for faith a hundred years 
	earlier. Solzhenitsyn gradually turned into a philosophically-minded man in 
	prison. He repented for what he did as a Red Army captain and in prison 
	compared himself with the perpetrators of the Gulag (&quot;I remember myself in 
	my captain's shoulders boards and the forward march of my battery through 
	East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were we any better?'&quot;) His 
	transformation is described at some length in the fourth part of The Gulag 
	Archipelago (&quot;The Soul and Barbed Wire&quot;). During his years of exile, and 
	following his reprieve and return to European Russia, Solzhenitsyn was, 
	while teaching at a secondary school during the day, spending his nights 
	secretly engaged in writing. He later wrote, in the short autobiography 
	composed at the time of his being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, 
	that &quot;during all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced I should 
	never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I 
	scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had 
	written because I feared this would become known.&quot; Finally, when he was 42 
	years old, he approached Alexander Tvardovsky, a poet and the chief editor 
	of the Noviy Mir magazine, with the manuscript of One Day in the Life of 
	Ivan Denisovich. It was published in edited form in 1962, with the explicit 
	approval of Nikita Khrushchev. This would be Solzhenitsyn's only book-length 
	work to be published in the Soviet Union until 1990. One Day in the Life of 
	Ivan Denisovich brought the Soviet system of prison labor to the attention 
	of the West. It caused as much a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did the 
	West&#8212;not only by its striking realism and candour, but also because it was 
	the first major piece of Soviet literature since the twenties on a 
	politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, even by a man who 
	had been to Siberia for &quot;libelous speech&quot; about the leaders, and still it 
	had not been censored. In this sense, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's 
	story was an almost unheard-of instance of free, unrestrained discussion of 
	politics through literature. Most Soviet readers realized this, but after 
	Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964, the time for such raw 
	exposing works came quietly, but perceptibly, to a close. Solzhenitsyn did 
	not give in but tried, with the help of Tvardovsky, to get his novel, The 
	Cancer Ward, legally published in the Soviet Union. This had to get the 
	approval of the Union of writers, and though some there appreciated it, the 
	work ultimately was denied publication if it were not revised and cleaned of 
	suspect statements and anti-soviet insinuations (these turnings are 
	recounted and documented in The Oak and the Calf). The printing of his work 
	quickly stopped; as a writer, he became a non-person, and, by 1965, the KGB 
	had seized some of his papers, including the manuscript of The First Circle. 
	Meanwhile Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the 
	most subversive of all his writings, the monumental Gulag Archipelago. The 
	seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but 
	gradually he realized it had set him free from the pretences and trappings 
	of being an &quot;officially acclaimed&quot; writer, something which had come close to 
	second-nature, but which was getting increasingly irrelevant (the 
	circumstances of how he actually survived in this period, without any income 
	from his books, are obscure; he had quit his teaching post when he broke 
	through as a writer). In 1970, Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Nobel Prize in 
	Literature. He could not receive the prize personally in Stockholm at that 
	time, since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union to 
	his family once he had left it. Instead, it was suggested he should receive 
	the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow. The 
	Swedish government refused to accept this solution, since such a ceremony 
	and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage 
	Sweden's relations to the superpower. Instead, Solzhenitsyn received his 
	prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been deported from the Soviet Union. 
	The Gulag Archipelago was a three volume work on the Soviet prison camp 
	system. It was based upon Solzhenitsyn's own experience as well as the 
	testimony of 227 former prisoners and Solzhenitsyn's own research into the 
	history of the penal system. It discussed the system's origins from Lenin 
	and the very founding of the Communist regime, detailing everything from 
	interrogation procedures and prisoner transports, to camp culture, prisoner 
	uprisings and revolts, and the practice of internal exile. The appearance of 
	the book in the West put the word gulag into the Western political 
	vocabulary and guaranteed swift retribution from the Soviet authorities.<br>
	<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In the West<br>
	</b>Solzhenitsyn became a cause célèbre in the West, earning him the enmity 
	of the Soviet regime. He could have emigrated at any time,[citation needed] 
	but always expressed the desire to stay in his motherland and work for 
	change from within. During this period, he was sheltered by the cellist 
	Mstislav Rostropovich, who suffered considerably for his support of 
	Solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself. However, on 
	February 13, 1974, Solzhenitsyn was deported from the Soviet Union to West 
	Germany and stripped of his Soviet citizenship. The KGB had found the 
	manuscript for the first part of The Gulag Archipelago. Less than a week 
	later, the Soviets carried out reprisals against Yevgeny Yevtushenko for his 
	support of Solzhenitsyn. After a time in Switzerland, Solzhenitsyn was 
	invited to Stanford University in the United States to &quot;facilitate your 
	work, and to accommodate you and your family.&quot; He stayed on the 11th floor 
	of the Hoover Tower, part of the Hoover Institution. Solzhenitsyn moved to 
	Cavendish, Vermont in 1976. He was given an honorary Literary Degree from 
	Harvard University in 1978 and on Thursday, June 8, 1978 he gave his 
	Commencement Address condemning modern western culture. Over the next 17 
	years, Solzhenitsyn worked hard on his historical cycle of the Russian 
	Revolution of 1917 The Red Wheel, four &quot;knots&quot; (parts of the whole) of which 
	had been completed by 1992, and outside of this, several shorter works. 
	Despite an enthusiastic welcome on his first arrival in America, followed by 
	respect for his privacy, he had never been comfortable outside his homeland. 
	He did not become fluent in spoken English despite spending two decades in 
	the United States; he has read works in English since his teens however, 
	something his mother encouraged him to do. More important, he resented the 
	idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking 
	to fit television. Solzhenitsyn's warnings about the dangers of Communist 
	aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the West were generally 
	well received in conservative circles in the West, and fit very well with 
	the toughening-up of foreign policy under U.S. President Ronald Reagan. But 
	liberals and secularists were increasingly critical of what they perceived 
	as his reactionary preference for Russian patriotism and the Russian 
	Orthodox religion. He also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness 
	and spiritual vapidity of the dominant pop culture of the modern West, 
	including television and rock music: &quot;&#8230;the human soul longs for things 
	higher, warmer and purer than those offered by today's mass living habits &#8230; 
	by TV stupor and by intolerable music.&quot;<br>

	</b>Solzhenitsyn boards a train in Vladivostok after returning to Russia 
	from exile. Photo by Mikhail EvstafievIn 1990, his Soviet citizenship was 
	restored, and, in 1994, he returned to Russia with his wife, Natalia, who 
	had become a United States citizen. Their sons stayed behind in the United 
	States (later, his oldest son Ermolay returned to Russia, to work for the 
	Moscow office of a leading management consultancy firm). Since then, he has 
	lived with his wife in a dacha in Troitse-Lykovo (&#1058;&#1088;&#1086;&#1080;&#1094;&#1077;-&#1051;&#1099;&#1082;&#1086;&#1074;&#1086;) in west 
	Moscow between the dachas once occupied by Mikhail Suslov and Konstantin 
	Chernenko. Since returning to Russia in 1994, Solzhenitsyn has published 
	eight two-part short stories, a series of contemplative &quot;miniatures&quot; or 
	prose poems, a literary memoir on his years in the West (The Grain Between 
	the Millstones) and a two-volume work on the history of Russian-Jewish 
	relations (Two Hundred Years Together 2001, 2002). In it, Solzhenitsyn 
	emphatically repudiates the idea the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917 
	were the work of a &quot;Jewish conspiracy&quot; . At the same time, he calls on both Russians and Jews to come to terms 
	with the members of their peoples who acted in complicity with the Communist 
	regime. The reception of this work confirms Solzhenitsyn remains a 
	polarizing figure both at home and abroad. According to his critics, the 
	book confirmed Solzhenitsyn's anti-Semitic views as well as his ideas of 
	Russian supremacy to other nations. Professor Robert Service of Oxford 
	University has defended Solzhenitsyn as being &quot;absolutely right&quot;, noting 
	Trotsky himself claimed Jews were disproportionately represented in the 
	early Soviet bureaucracy.Another famous Russian dissident writer, Vladimir 
	Voinovich, wrote a polemical study &quot;A Portrait Against the Background of a 
	Myth&quot; (&quot;&#1055;&#1086;&#1088;&#1090;&#1088;&#1077;&#1090; &#1085;&#1072; &#1092;&#1086;&#1085;&#1077; &#1084;&#1080;&#1092;&#1072;&quot;, 2002.), in which he had tried to prove 
	Solzhenitsyn's egoism, antisemitism, and lack of writing skills. Voinovich 
	had already mocked Solzhenitsyn in his novel Moscow 2042, portraying him by 
	the self-centered egomaniac Sim Simich Karnavalov, an extreme and brutal 
	dictatorial writer who tries to destroy the Soviet Union and, eventually, to 
	become the king of Russia. Using a more circuitous line of argument, Joseph 
	Brodsky, in his essay Catastrophes in the Air (in Less than One), argued 
	Solzhenitsyn, while a hero in showing up the brutalities of Soviet 
	Communism, failed to discern the historical crimes he unearthed might be the 
	outcome of authoritarian traits who were really part of the heritage of Old 
	Russia and of &quot;the severe spirit of Orthodoxy&quot; (venerated by Solzhenitsyn) 
	and much less due to more recent (Marxist) political ideology. In his recent 
	political writings, such as Rebuilding Russia (1990) and Russia in Collapse 
	(1998), Solzhenitsyn has criticized the oligarchic excesses of the new 
	Russian 'democracy,' while opposing any nostalgia for Soviet communism. He 
	has defended moderate and self-critical patriotism (as opposed to extreme 
	nationalism), argued for the indispensability of local self-government to a 
	free Russia, and expressed concerns for the fate of the 25 million ethnic 
	Russians in the &quot;near abroad&quot; of the former Soviet Union. He has also sought 
	to &quot;protect&quot; the national character of the Russian Orthodox church and 
	fought against the admission of Catholic priests and Protestant pastors to 
	Russia from other countries. For a brief period, he had his own TV show, 
	where he freely expressed his views. The show was cancelled because of low 
	ratings, but Solzhenitsyn continued to maintain a relatively high profile in 
	the media. <br>
	All of Solzhenitsyn's sons became U.S. citizens. One, Ignat, has achieved 
	acclaim as a pianist and conductor in the United States. <br>
	Since the death of Naguib Mahfouz in 2006, Solzhenitsyn is the oldest living 
	Nobel laureate in literature. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most complete 30-volume edition of 
	Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s selected works is soon to be published in Russia. The 
	presentation of its first three published volumes has recently taken place 
	in Moscow. On June 5, 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree 
	conferring the State Prize of the Russian Federation for the humanitarian 
	work of Solzhenitsyn. President Putin personally visited the writer at his 
	home on June 12, 2007, to give him the award.<br>

	<b>SHORT STORIES<br>
	</b><br>
	Two features of recent fiction writing m the U.S.A. frequently remarked on 
	are the tendency for novelists to write one very good book whose quality is 
	never repeated, and a fondness, especially among 'regional' writers, for the 
	short story. The former has sometimes been ascribed to a surfeit of early 
	critical praise, or material profit, taking the edge off a writer's 
	'hunger'; the latter partly to the influence of <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine. 
	Among the many outstanding practitioners of the short story are the 
	Polish-born Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904&#8212;91), who wrote originally in 
	Yiddish; the once very popular John O'Hara (1905-70); Flannery O'Connor 
	(1925-64) and Carson Meddlers (1917-67), exponents of what is called 
	'Southern Gothic'; Mississippi-born Euclora Welty (born 1909); and the 
	highly esteeemed Raymond Carver (1938-88). John Updike (born 1932), best

	AFTER THE WAR<br>

	</b>Expectations of a literary revival after the Second World War comparable 
	with that of the First, were largely disappointed. Big changes in outlook 
	and interesting developments in many spheres were occurring, but by and 
	large, the writers who held centre stage were those of the previous 
	generation, such as <b>Fitzgerald</b>, <b>Hemingway</b>,<b> Faulkner</b>, and on a lesser plane, 
	James Gould Cozzens. However, <b>James Jones</b> (<i>From Here to Eternity</i>, 1951) and 
	<b>Norman Mailer</b> (<i>The Naked and the Dead</i>, 1948), made their names as war 
	novelists. Jones, arguably, never quite repeated his early success, but 
	Mailer became increasingly famous, through his not-so-private life as well 
	as his varied and uneven writings. The most successful war novel, eight 
	years in the writing and a bestseller of huge dimensions, was Joseph 
	Heller's surreal black comedy, Catch-22 (1961). The title is now a familiar 
	term for an absurd and insoluble dilemma.<br>
	<br>
	The novel of the 1950s most widely admired by younger readers was <b>J. D. 
	Salinger's</b> <i>Catcher in The Rye </i>(1951), with its 16-year-old narrator, Holden 
	Caulfield, seeming in retrospect a herald of 1960s youth culture. Salinger's

	Saint Petersburg &#8211; July 2, 1977, Montreux) was a multilingual 
	Russian-American novelist and short story writer. Nabokov wrote his first 
	nine novels in Russian, then rose to international prominence as a master 
	English prose stylist. He also made significant contributions to entomology 
	and had an interest in chess problems. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nabokov's <i>Lolita</i> (1955) is 
	frequently cited as his most important novel, and is his most widely known, 
	exhibiting the love of intricate wordplay and descriptive detail that 
	characterized all his works.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Russia<br>
	</b>The eldest son of Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov and his wife, née Elena 
	Ivanovna Rukavishnikova, he was born to a rich and prominent Orthodox family 
	of the untitled nobility of Saint Petersburg. He spent his childhood and 
	youth there and at the country estate Vyra near Siverskaya. Nabokov's 
	childhood, which he called &quot;perfect,&quot; was remarkable in several ways. The 
	family spoke Russian, English and French in their household, and Nabokov was 
	trilingual from an early age. In fact, much to his father's patriotic 
	chagrin, Nabokov could read and write English before he could Russian. In 
	Speak, Memory Nabokov recalls numerous details of his privileged childhood, 
	and his ability to recall in vivid detail memories of his past was a boon to 
	him during his permanent exile, as well as providing a theme which echoes 
	from his first book, Mary, all the way to later works such as Ada or Ardor: 
	A Family Chronicle. In 1916 Nabokov inherited the estate Rozhestveno, next 
	to Vyra, from his uncle Vasiliy Ivanovich Rukavishnikov (&quot;Uncle Ruka&quot; in 
	Speak, Memory), but lost it in the revolution one year later; this was the 
	only house he would ever own. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Emigration<br>
	</b>The Nabokov family left Saint Petersburg in the wake of the 1917 
	Revolution for a friend's estate in the Crimea, where they remained for 18 
	months. The family did not expect to be out of Saint Petersburg for very 
	long, but in fact they would never return. In September of 1918, they moved 
	to Livadia. After the withdrawal of the German Army (November 1918) and 
	following the defeat of the White Army in early 1919, the Nabokovs left for 
	exile in western Europe. On April 2, 1919, the family left Sevastopol. They 
	settled briefly in England, where Vladimir enrolled in Trinity College, 
	Cambridge and studied Slavic and Romance languages. His Cambridge 
	experiences would later help him in the writing of the novel Glory. In 1920, 
	his family moved to Berlin where his father set up the émigré newspaper Rul'. 
	VN would follow to Berlin after his studies at Cambridge two years later. In 
	1922, Nabokov's father was assassinated in Berlin by Russian monarchists as 
	he tried to shelter their real target, Pavel Milyukov, a leader of the 
	Constitutional Democratic Party-in-exile. This episode of mistaken, violent 
	death would echo again and again in the author's fiction, where characters 
	would meet their deaths under mistaken terms. In Pale Fire, for example, the 
	poet Shade is murdered accidentally (allegedly) when an assassin fires his 
	weapon at an (alleged) former king. Shortly after his father's death, his 
	mother and sister moved to Prague. VN, however, stayed in Berlin where he 
	became a recognized poet and writer within the émigré community and 
	published under his pen name V. Sirin - it may signify an owl or a 
	mythological bird - , a pseudonym he used for his Russian writings for about 
	four decades. In Berlin, he also tutored and gave tennis lessons. In 1922 
	Nabokov became engaged to Svetlana Siewert; the engagement was broken off in 
	early 1923 as he had no steady job. In May 1923, he met Véra Evseyevna 
	Slonim and married her in 1925. Their only child, Dmitri, was born in 1934. 
	In 1936, when Vera lost her job due to the antisemitic environment, and the 
	assassin of his father was appointed second-in-command of the Russian émigré 
	group, Nabokov started to look for jobs in the English-speaking world. He 
	left Germany with his family in 1937. He and his family moved to Paris, but 
	also stayed during this journey at times at Prague, Cannes, Menton, Cap 
	d'Antibes, and Frejus. In May 1940 the Nabokov family fled from the 
	advancing German troops to the United States on board the Champlain. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>America<br>
	</b>The Nabokovs settled down in Manhattan and VN started a job at the 
	American Museum of Natural History. In October he met Edmund Wilson, who 
	introduced Nabokov's work to American editors, leading eventually to his 
	recognition. Nabokov came to Wellesley College in 1941 as resident lecturer 
	in comparative literature. The position, created specifically for him, 
	provided an income and free time to write creatively and pursue his 
	lepidoptery. Nabokov is remembered as the founder of Wellesley's Russian 
	Department. His lecture series on major nineteenth-century Russian writers 
	was hailed as &quot;funny,&quot; &quot;learned,&quot; and &quot;brilliantly satirical.&quot; The Nabokovs 
	resided in Wellesley, Massachusetts during the 1941-42 academic year; they 
	moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in September 1942 and lived there until 
	June 1948. Following a lecture tour through the United States, Nabokov 
	returned to Wellesley for the 1944&#8211;45 academic year as a lecturer in 
	Russian. He served through the 1947-48 term as Wellesley's one-man Russian 
	Department, offering courses in Russian language and literature. His classes 
	were popular, due as much to his unique teaching style as to the wartime 
	interest in all things Russian. At the same time he was curator of 
	lepidoptery at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Biology. After being 
	encouraged by Morris Bishop, Nabokov left Wellesley in 1948 to teach Russian 
	and European literature at Cornell University. In 1945, he became a 
	naturalized citizen of the United States. Nabokov wrote his novel Lolita 
	while traveling on butterfly-collection trips in the western United States. 
	(Nabokov never learned to drive, Vera acted as chauffeur; when VN attempted 
	to burn unfinished drafts of Lolita, it was Vera who stopped him. He called 
	her the best-humored woman he had ever known. Despite this, biographers - in 
	particular, Stacy Shiff - have made it clear that he regularly strayed in 
	his marriage.) In June 1953 he and his family came to Ashland, Oregon, 
	renting a house on Meade Street from Professor Taylor, head of the Southern 
	Oregon College Department of Social Science. There he finished Lolita and 
	began writing the novel Pnin. He roamed the nearby mountains looking for 
	butterflies, and wrote a poem Lines Written in Oregon. On October 1, 1953, 
	he and his family left for Ithaca, New York.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Montreux<br>
	</b>After the great financial success of Lolita, Nabokov was able to return 
	to Europe and devote himself exclusively to writing. Also his son had gotten 
	a position as an operatic bass at Reggio Emilia. On October 1, 1961, he and 
	Véra moved to the Montreux Palace Hotel in Montreux, Switzerland; he stayed 
	there until the end of his life. From his sixth-floor quarters he conducted 
	his business and took tours to the Alps, Corsica, and Sicily to hunt 
	butterflies. In 1976 he was hospitalized with an undiagnosed fever; 
	rehospitalized in Lausanne in 1977, he suffered from severe bronchial 
	congestion, and died on July 2. His remains were cremated and are buried at 
	the Clarens cemetery in Montreux.At the time of his death, he was working on 
	a novel titled The Original of Laura. His wife Vera and son Dmitri were 
	entrusted with Nabokov's literary executorship, and though he asked them to 
	burn the manuscript, they were unable to destroy his final work. The 
	incomplete manuscript, which is said to consist of around 125 handwritten 
	index cards, has remained in a Swiss bank vault ever since. Only two people, 
	Dmitri Nabokov and an unknown person, have access to the vault. Portions of 
	the manuscript have been shown to Nabokov scholars. In April, 2008, Dmitri 
	announced that he would publish the novel.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Birth date<br>
	</b>Nabokov was born on April 10, 1899 according to the Julian calendar in 
	use in Russia at that time. The Gregorian equivalent is April 22, which is 
	achieved by adding 12 days to the Julian date. Some sources have incorrectly 
	calculated a date of April 23, by inappropriately using the 13-day 
	difference in the calendars that applied only after February 28, 1900. In 
	Speak, Memory Nabokov explains the cause of the error and confirms the 
	correct date of April 22. But he himself celebrated his birthday on April 
	23, and stated in an interview with The New York Times, &quot;That is also 
	Shakespeare&#8217;s and Shirley Temple&#8217;s, so I have nothing to lose by saying I 
	was born on the 23rd.&quot;<br>

	<br>
	<b>Work</b></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nabokov's first writings were in Russian, 
	but he came to his greatest distinction in the English language. For this 
	achievement, he has been compared with Joseph Conrad; yet some view this as 
	a dubious comparison, as Conrad composed only in English, never in his 
	native Polish. (Nabokov himself disdained the comparison for aesthetic 
	reasons, lamenting to the critic Edmund Wilson, &quot;I am too old to change 
	Conradically&quot; &#8212; which John Updike later called, &quot;itself a jest of genius.&quot; 
	Nabokov, in the very early fifties, offered the critic Edmund Wilson a 
	pocket appraisal: &quot;Conrad knew how to handle readymade English better than 
	I; but I know better the other kind. He never sinks to the depths of my 
	solecisms, but neither does he scale my verbal peaks.&quot;)&nbsp; Nabokov 
	translated many of his own early works into English, sometimes in 
	cooperation with his son Dmitri. His trilingual upbringing had a profound 
	influence on his artistry. He has metaphorically described the transition 
	from one language to another as the slow journey at night from one village 
	to the next with only a candle for illumination. Nabokov himself translated 
	two books he wrote in English into Russian, Conclusive Evidence, and Lolita. 
	The first &quot;translation&quot; was made because of Nabokov's feeling of 
	imperfection in the English version. Writing the book, he noted that he 
	needed to translate his own memories into English, and to spend a lot of 
	time explaining things which are well-known in Russia; then he decided to 
	re-write the book once again, in his first native language, and after that 
	he made the final version, Speak, Memory (Nabokov first wanted to name it 
	&quot;Speak, Mnemosyne&quot;). Nabokov was a proponent of individualism, and rejected 
	concepts and ideologies that curtailed individual freedom and expression, 
	such as totalitarianism in its various forms as well as Freud's 
	psychoanalysis. Poshlost, or as he transcribed it, poshlust, is disdained 
	and frequently mocked in his works.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nabokov is noted for his complex plots, 
	clever word play, and use of alliteration. He gained both fame and notoriety 
	with his novel Lolita (1955), which tells of a grown man's devouring passion 
	for a twelve-year-old girl. This and his other novels, particularly Pale 
	Fire (1962), won him a place among the greatest novelists of the 20th 
	century. His longest novel, which met with a mixed response, is Ada (1969). 
	He devoted more time to the composition of this novel than any of his 
	others. Nabokov's fiction is characterized by its linguistic playfulness. 
	For example, his short story &quot;The Vane Sisters&quot; is famous in part for its 
	acrostic final paragraph, in which the first letters of each word spell out 
	a message from beyond the grave. Nabokov's stature as a literary critic is 
	founded largely on his four-volume translation of and commentary on 
	Aleksandr Pushkin's epic of the Russian soul, Eugene Onegin, published in 
	1964. That commentary ended with an appendix titled Notes on Prosody which 
	has developed a reputation of its own. It stemmed from his observation that 
	while Pushkin's iambic tetrameters had been a part of Russian literature for 
	a fairly short two centuries, they were clearly understood by the Russian 
	prosodists. On the other hand, he viewed the much older English iambic 
	tetrameters as muddled and poorly documented. In his own words: </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have been forced to invent a simple 
	little terminology of my own, explain its application to English verse 
	forms, and indulge in certain rather copious details of classification 
	before even tackling the limited object of these notes to my translation of 
	Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, an object that boils down to very little&#8212;in 
	comparison to the forced preliminaries &#8212; namely, to a few things that the 
	non-Russian student of Russian literature must know in regard to Russian 
	prosody in general and to Eugene Onegin in particular. <br>
	<br>
	Nabokov's translation was the focus of a bitter polemic with Edmund Wilson 
	and others; he had rendered the very precisely metered and rhyming novel in 
	verse to (by his own admission) stumbling, non-rhymed prose. He argued that 
	all verse translations of Onegin fatally betrayed the author's use of 
	language; critics replied that failure to make the translation as 
	beautifully styled as the original was a much greater betrayal. Nabokov's 
	Lectures on Literature at Cornell University where he was appointed an 
	instructor in 1948, reveals his controversial ideas concerning art. He 
	firmly believed that novels should not aim to teach and that readers should 
	not merely empathise with characters but that a 'higher' aesthetic enjoyment 
	should be attained, partly by paying great attention to details of style and 
	structure. He detested what he saw as 'general ideas' in novels, and so when 
	teaching Ulysses, for example, he would insist students keep an eye on where 
	the characters were in Dublin (with the aid of a map) rather than teaching 
	the complex Irish history that many critics see as being essential to an 
	understanding of the novel. During his ten years at Cornell, Nabokov 
	introduced undergraduates to the delights of great fiction, including the 
	Bleak House of Charles Dickens in fifty-minute classroom lectures. Nabokov's 
	detractors fault him for being an aesthete and for his over-attention to 
	language and detail rather than character development. In his essay &quot;Nabokov, 
	or Nostalgia,&quot; Danilo Ki&#353; wrote that Nabokov's is &quot;a magnificent, complex, 
	and sterile art.&quot; Russian poet Yvgeny Yevtushenko said in a Playboy 
	interview that he could hear the clatter of surgical tools in VN's prose. 
	Not until glasnost did Nabokov's work become officially available in his 
	native country. Gorbachev authorized a five-volume edition of his writing in 
	1988. </font></td>

	novels that fall within these genres are not only far from aesthetically 
	worthless, they occupy the same aesthetic plane as the most high-flown works

	THE SPY NOVEL<br>
	<br>
	</b>The spy novel has roots in the adventure stories of John Buchan 
	(1875-1940), and Erskine Childers's <i>The Riddle of the Sands</i> (1903) is an 
	early classic. Its golden age coincided with the Cold War, and its most 
	adept practitioners were often former officers in intelligence services, 
	such as <b>Graham Greene </b>(1904&#8212;91). Greene was one of the most distinguished 
	British novelists of the century who, incidentally, divided his fiction into 
	novels and 'entertainments', his spy stories (e.g. <i>The Confidential Agent</i>, 
	<i>The Human Factor</i>) falling into the latter category. The most popular spy 
	stories of the period were those of Ian Fleming's (1908&#8212;64) hero James Bond, 
	the inspiration for a seemingly endless series of&nbsp; blockbusting films. 
	The supreme exponent of the Cold War spy novel, however, is John Le Carre, 
	whose <i>The Spy Who Came In From the Cold </i>(1963) was described by Greene as 
	&quot;the best spy story I have ever read'. Le Carre's thorough research, subtle 
	plots and vivid characterization were displayed in a series of gripping, 
	often bleak novels.</font></td>

		SCIENCE FICTION<br><br></b>American writers were also prominent in the 'golden age' of science 
	fiction, after the Second World War. Science fiction, variously defined, 
	describes stories set in an imaginary, usually future world where more or 
	less feasible scientific advances have created a different society. Although 
	much earlier prototypes could be cited, modern science fiction is generally 
	held to have begun with <b>Jules Verne</b> (1928-1905), author of numerous 
	'scientific' adventures (e.g. Journey to the <i>Centre of the Earth</i>, <i>Twenty 
	Thousand Eeagnes Under the Sea</i>), <b>H. G. Wells</b> (1866-1946), whose SF novels 
	(<i>The Time Machine</i>, <i>The War of the Worlds</i>, etc.) represented but one of the 
	interests of an extraordinary polymath and social reformer, and <b>Karel Capek</b> 
	(1890-1938), who coined the term 'robot'.<br><br>Aldous Huxley's dystopia,
		<i>Brave New World</i> (1932) helped to make SF more 
	respectable, but in the postwar era it varied greatly in literary quality, 
	much of it not aspiring to a level above pulp fiction. The legendary editor 
	of <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i>, John W. Campbell, was a powerful influence in 
	extending the genre and raising standards. Among the most popular American 
	SF writers in that era were <b>Isaac Asimov</b>, Frederick Pohl, C. W. Kornbluth, 
	Walter M. Miller, Philip K. Dick and Ursula Le Guin (women SF writers were 
	comparatively rare), and among the British, (Sir) Arthur C. Clarke (who 
	forecast communications satellites), John Wyndham, Brian Aldiss and Michael 
	Moorcock. The latter's novels straddled the nebulous boundary between SF and 
	'Fantasy' fiction, another modern variant of the Gothic.<br><br>With the nuclear age, SF entered the literary mainstream. The British 
	novelist and poet Kingsley Amis was the first to write a serious study of SF 
	(<i>New Maps of Hell</i>, 1961), and writers such as J. G. Ballard (born 1930) and 
	the inimitable <b>Kurt Vonnegut</b> (born 1922) could not be placed in what was 
	traditionally regarded as an inferior category; in fact, much of their work

	Colding, a future Nobel prizewinner, began his literary career at 43 with 
	the arresting <i>Lord of the Flies </i>(1954), a parable about a school choir 
	marooned on a tropical island. Another memorable anti-Utopian novel was

	besides Golding's, were <i>Under the Net</i>, an existential comedy by the Oxford 
	philosopher Iris Murdoch, and <i>Lucky Jim</i>, an uproarious, rebellious comedy 
	set in a provincial, 'red-brick' university, by Kingsley Amis. It was the 
	first British 'campus novel', a comedic genre richly exploited later by 
	Malcolm Bradbury (born 1932) and David Lodge (born 1935). Lodge was another 
	Catholic, and so, by conversion, was Muriel Spark, the first of whose wry 
	comedies, <i>The Comforters</i>, was published in 1957. Doris Lessing arrived from 
	Rhodesia to begin the first of her ambitious novel sequences with <i>The Grass

	S. Naipaul, Salman Rushdie, Timothy Mo and Hanif Kureishi, from different

	(1950) is set in Leicester, though his characters, civil servants, 
	gravitated to Whitehall later, where they might have met the characters of 
	C. P. Snow, another Leicester-bred civil servant, though his best-known

	<br>
	Ireland, as ever, swelled with literary talent - and literary rows. The 
	troubles in the North, as troubles often do, motivated many fine writers. In

	McGahern's second novel, <i>The Dark</i> (1965), lost him his teaching post; and 
	short-story writer Frank O'Connor (1903&#8212;66) feelingly advised Irish writers 
	to cultivate the hide of a rhinoceros and to live near the sea. The Irish

	preferred to move out, including the Belfast-born Brian Moore (born 1921).

	It is common to speak of a Scottish literary renaissance in the late 20th 
	century. It was centred largely on Glasgow and its populist tradition, and

	immediately hailed as a masterpiece. On a smaller scale, the sometimes

	(born March 6, 1927) is a Colombian novelist, short-story writer,

	his native country, is considered one of the most significant authors of the 
	20th century. In 1982, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He 
	pursued a self-directed education that resulted in his leaving law school 
	for a career in journalism. From early on, he showed no inhibitions in his 
	criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958, he married Mercedes 
	Barcha and they have two sons. He started as a journalist, and has written 
	many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best-known for 
	his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) and Love in the 
	Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim 
	and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary 
	style labeled as magical realism, which uses magical elements and events in 
	order to explain real experiences. Some of his works are set in a fictional 
	village called Macondo, and most of them express the theme of solitude. <br>
	Gabriel García Márquez was born on March 6, 1927 in the town of Aracataca, 
	Colombia, to Gabriel Eligio García and Luisa Santiaga Márquez. Soon after 
	García Márquez was born, his father became a pharmacist. In January 1929, 
	his parents moved to Baranquilla while García Marquez stayed in Aracataca. 
	He was raised by his maternal grandparents, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán and 
	Colonel Nicolás Ricardo Márquez Mejía. When he was eight, his grandfather 
	died, and he moved to his parents' home in Barranquilla where his father 
	owned a pharmacy.When his parents fell in love their relationship met with 
	resistance from Luisa Santiaga Marquez's father, the Colonel. Gabriel Eligio 
	García was not the man the Colonel had envisioned winning the heart of his 
	daughter: he was a Conservative, and had the reputation of being a 
	womanizer. Gabriel Eligio wooed Luisa with violin serenades, love poems, 
	countless letters, and even telegraph messages after her father sent her 
	away with the intention of separating the young couple. Her parents tried 
	everything to get rid of the man, but he kept coming back, and it was 
	obvious their daughter was committed to him. Her family finally capitulated 
	and gave her permission to marry him. (The tragicomic story of their 
	courtship would later be adapted and recast as Love in the Time of Cholera.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since García Márquez's parents were more or 
	less strangers to him for the first few years of his life, his grandparents 
	influenced his early development very strongly. His grandfather, who he 
	called &quot;Papalelo&quot;, was a Liberal veteran of the Thousand Days War. The 
	Colonel was considered a hero by Colombian Liberals and was highly 
	respected. He was well-known for his refusal to remain silent about the 
	banana massacres that took place the year García Márquez was born. The 
	Colonel, whom García Márquez has described as his &quot;umbilical cord with 
	history and reality&quot;, was also an excellent storyteller. He taught García 
	Márquez lessons from the dictionary, took him to the circus each year, and 
	was the first to introduce his grandson to ice&#8212;a &quot;miracle&quot; found at the 
	United Fruit Company store. He would also occasionally tell his young 
	grandson &quot;You can't imagine how much a dead man weighs&quot;, reminding him that 
	there was no greater burden than to have killed a man, a lesson that García 
	Márquez would later integrate into his novels. García Márquez's political 
	and ideological views were shaped by his grandfather's stories. In an 
	interview, García Márquez told his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, &quot;my 
	grandfather the Colonel was a Liberal. My political ideas probably came from 
	him to begin with because, instead of telling me fairy tales when I was 
	young, he would regale me with horrifying accounts of the last civil war 
	that free-thinkers and anti-clerics waged against the Conservative 
	government.&quot; This influenced his political views and his literary technique 
	so that &quot;in the same way that his writing career initially took shape in 
	conscious opposition to the Colombian literary status quo, García Márquez's 
	socialist and anti-imperialist views are in principled opposition to the 
	global status quo dominated by the United States&quot;.García Márquez's 
	grandmother, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes, played an equally influential 
	role in his upbringing. He was inspired by the way she &quot;treated the 
	extraordinary as something perfectly natural.&quot; The house was filled with 
	stories of ghosts and premonitions, omens and portents, all of which were 
	studiously ignored by her husband. According to García Márquez she was &quot;the 
	source of the magical, superstitious and supernatural view of reality&quot;. He 
	enjoyed his grandmother's unique way of telling stories. No matter how 
	fantastic or improbable her statements, she always delivered them as if they 
	were the irrefutable truth. It was a deadpan style that, some thirty years 
	later, heavily influenced her grandson's most popular novel, One Hundred 
	Years of Solitude.<br>
	In 1940, García Márquez left his family who had moved a year earlier to 
	Sucre in order to begin his secondary school education at the Jesuit 
	boarding school of San José in Barranquilla. At San José, he first published 
	his words in the school magazine Juventud. On a visit to his parents in 
	Sucre, he met Mercedes Barcha at a student dance, and knew right away that 
	he intended to marry her when they were finished with their studies.In 1943, 
	he was awarded a scholarship to attend the Liceo Nacional de Varones in 
	Zipaquirá, a city thirty miles north of Bogotá. In an interview, García 
	Márquez noted,&quot;My literary background was basically in poetry, but bad 
	poetry ... I started out with the poetry that appeared in grammar books. I 
	realized that what I most liked was poetry and what I most hated was Spanish 
	class, grammar.&quot; During this period García Márquez also read a wide variety 
	of European classics in addition to Spanish and Colombian literature.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If I had nothing to do and to avoid getting 
	bored I'd hole up at the school library, where they had the Aldeana 
	collection. I read the whole thing! ... From volume one to the last! I read 
	El carnero, memoirs, reminiscences ... I read it all! Of course, when I 
	reached my last year in secondary school, I knew more than the teacher did.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After graduation in 1947, he started law 
	school at the National University of Colombia in Bogotá. While in Bogotá, 
	García Márquez took up a program of self-directed reading. Metamorphosis by 
	Franz Kafka was one work which particularly inspired him. He was excited by 
	the idea that one could write acceptable literature in an untraditional 
	style that was so similar to his grandmother's stories which &quot;inserted 
	bizarre events into an ordinary setting and related those anomalies as if 
	they were just another aspect of everyday life&quot;. He was now more eager to be 
	a writer than before. Soon after, his first published story La tercera 
	resignación appeared in the September 13, 1947 edition of the newspaper El 
	Espectador.Although his passion was now writing, he continued in the law 
	school in 1948 to please his father. During the Bogotá riots on April 9, 
	1948, the university closed indefinitely and his boarding house was burnt 
	down&nbsp; and thus García Márquez transferred to the University of 
	Cartagena. By 1950, he gave up on the idea of becoming a lawyer to focus on 
	journalism. He moved back to Barranquilla to write for the newspaper, El 
	Heraldo. In his autobiography, he says: &quot;I had left the university a year 
	before with the rash hope that I could earn a living in journalism and 
	literature without any need to learn them, inspired by a sentence I believe 
	I had read in George Bernard Shaw, 'From a very early age I've had to 
	interrupt my education to go to school.'&quot; Although García Márquez never 
	finished university, Columbia University in New York awarded him an honorary 
	doctorate of letters in 1971.<br>
	García Márquez began his career as a journalist while studying law in 
	university. In 1948 and 1949 he wrote for El Universal in Cartagena. Later, 
	from 1950 until 1952, he wrote a &quot;whimsical&quot; column under the name of &quot;Septimus&quot; 
	for the local paper El Heraldo in Barranquilla. García Márquez noted of his 
	time at El Heraldo, &quot;I'd write a piece and they'd pay me three pesos for it, 
	and maybe an editorial for another three.&quot; During this time he became an 
	active member of the informal group of writers and journalists known as the 
	Barranquilla Group, an association that provided great motivation and 
	inspiration for his literary career. He worked with inspirational figures 
	such as Ramon Vinyes, who García Márquez depicted as an Old Catalan who owns 
	a bookstore in One Hundred Years of Solitude.[45] At this time, García 
	Márquez was also introduced to the works of writers such as Virginia Woolf 
	and William Faulkner. Faulkner's narrative techniques, historical themes and 
	use of provincial locations influenced Latin American authors. The 
	environment of Barranquilla gave García Márquez a world-class literary 
	education and provided him with a unique perspective on Caribbean culture. 
	From 1954 to 1955, García Márquez spent time in Bogotá and regularly wrote 
	for Bogotá's El Espectador. He was a regular film critic which drove his 
	interest in film. <br>
	After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez returned to 
	Europe, this time bringing along his family, to live in Barcelona, Spain for 
	seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned with the 
	publication of the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in 
	several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, 
	including the former 19th of April Movement and the current FARC and ELN 
	organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with 
	powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, 
	which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. In an 
	interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship 
	with Castro is mostly based on literature: &#8220;Ours is an intellectual 
	friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. 
	When we&#8217;re together, we talk a great deal about literature.&#8221;Also due to his 
	newfound fame and his outspoken views on U.S. imperialism he was labeled as 
	a subversive and for many years was denied visas by U.S. immigration 
	authorities. However, after Bill Clinton was elected U.S. president, he 
	finally lifted the travel ban and claimed that García Márquez's One Hundred 
	Years of Solitude was his favorite novel.</font></td>

		<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>FEMINISM<br></b><br>So-called special-interest groups have in recent times led to serious 
	questioning of the established literary tradition. Undeniably, Western 
	literary traditions are founded predominantly on the work of, as denigrators 
	put it, dead white males. If you belong to a non-Western culture, if you are 
	neither dead, white nor male, it is not surprising that you should question 
	the values of the traditional literary hierarchy.<br>A major influence in the last generation or so has been the rise of modern 
	feminism. The idea of a distinction between 'masculine' and 'feminine' 
	writing may be questionable (and even, from a feminist point of view, 
	counterproductive), but there are certainly qualities of style and thinking 
	that are commonly so described. Feminist criticism, however, has had two 
	main effects. The first is in reassessing earlier literature, often in 
	opposition to the prevailing culture of its time. This has led to 
	interesting new views of, in particular, 19th-century novels. The second is 
	in rediscovering or reassessing neglected female writers of earlier times. 
	In this endeavour feminist publishers, such as Virago in Britain, have 
	played a major role.</font></blockquote>

		<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>RACE<br><br></b>English, and to a lesser extent French and other European literature, 
	has long been a worldwide phenomenon, but until recently it was largely 
	confined to the British and their cultural descendants in North America and 
	the old dominions. No longer. In recent years nominees, sometimes winners, 
	of the chief annual British literary award, the Booker Prize, have included 
	many Asian and African authors. However, the biggest impact has been made by 
	Afro-American writers, who have blossomed since the civil-rights movement of 
	the 1960s. Several of the best of them happen to be women and belong, more 
	or less closely, to the feminist movement also. The outstanding figure is 
	probably the novelist Toni Morrison (born 1931), who won the Nobel Prize in 
	1993. Alice Walker's (born 1944) <i>The Color Purple</i> was a huge international 
	bestseller. A poem by Maya Angelou (born 1928) was read at President 
	Clinton's inauguration. Another healthy sign is a growing tendency for black

		<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>CENSORSHIP<br><br></b>Censorship of publications has existed in all societies and no doubt 
	always will exist, though developments in information technology appear to 
	be making the laws difficult to enforce. Historically, the invention of 
	printing seemed to present similar threats. During the English Reformation, 
	Henry VIII established a licensing system that, in principle, controlled all 
	printed matter: 'popish' propaganda was then the chief concern. It was this 
	opprobrious system that led to one of the earliest defences of the freedom 
	of the press. Milton's <i>Areopatigica</i> (1644, published without licence) and 
	the subsequent abolition of the system. (Nevertheless, all plays for public 
	performance in Britain had to be approved by an official called the Lord 
	Chamberlain until 1968.) In the 18th century the political press, with its 
	often scurrilous attacks on public officials, was dealt with under laws 
	against 'seditious libel'. In the 19th century obscenity, or just plain sex, 
	became the main worry. Early ages being less pernickety, this raised a 
	multitude of problems (as libertarians often pointed out, the Bible contains 
	plenty of sex and violence). Dr Bowdler formed a Society for the Suppression 
	of Vice in 1802 and himself produced a 'bowdlerized' edition of Shakespeare, 
	removing all 'indecencies'. Parliament passed an Obscene Publications Act in 
	185&quot;7, contributing to the thriving business of underground pornography. 
	Famous victims of the act and its successor of 1959 included Joyce's 
	Ulysses, the entire first edition of which was confiscated in 1923, and 
	Lawrence's <i>Lady Chatterleys Lover</i>, subject of a famous case in 1960, when 
	Penguin Books, win. had risked publishing the first unexpurgated edition in 
	Britain, won acquittal.<br>The terms of all such legislation are necessarily vague and open to 
	inerpretation. Writing, deemed blasphemous (in Britain, to Christians only) or 
	seditious is also liable to prosecution. The modern equivalent of Dr Bowdler 
	is 'political correctness', an insidious, informal kind of censorship which, 
	if often understandable or even desirable, can lead to absurdities, such as 
	the banning from public libraries books which contain words now seen as 
	racial epithets.<br>An recent example of censorship was provoked by <b>Salman Rushdie</b>'s novel
		<i>The Satanic Verses</i> (1988), which many Muslims regarded as blasphemous. The 
	extremist leader of Iran published a f<i>atwa</i> or religious decree demanding 
	the author's death, and as a result Rushdie was forced to live in hiding 
	under police protection.</font></blockquote>
