<h3><font size="5">After you get your Car Dealer's License, WHO will teach you
the business?</font></h3>
<p>Through the years, I've seen many dealers struggle.&nbsp; They get their car
dealer license just fine, but they don't really understand how the car business
works.&nbsp; If you don't understand the dealer auctions, you will be eaten
alive!&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't take any chances.&nbsp; You can find car dealer license
publications at:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dealerlicense.com/dealers.html">http://www.dealerlicense.com/dealers.html</a></p>

<h2>WARNING:&nbsp; Out-of-State licenses are NOT the best idea:</h2>
<p>I AM A CAR DEALER AND I AM ALSO A LAWYER, SO I HOPE YOU TAKE THE FOLLOWING
SERIOUSLY:</p>
<p>There are many programs online where you can &quot;rent&quot; a dealer
license or get licensed out-of-state.&nbsp; If you are wholesaling from
auction-to-auction, it's difficult for your state to bust you.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, these programs can be problematic, especially if you are advertising to
the retail public in your state, even if you are a wholesaler who sells
&quot;through&quot; a network of local dealers.&nbsp; Even if you have a
wholesale license in another state, by advertising to the retail public in your
state, you are purporting to be a retailer and since you do NOT have a retail
license in your state, the state considers it &quot;unlicensed auto sales&quot;,
which is usually a misdemeanor crime.&nbsp; If you don't believe me, simply call
your local DMV investigator and they will certainly tell you the same thing.</p>
<p><img border="0" alt="Florida" src="Florida4.gif" width="878" height="286"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>States are Cracking Down on Out-of-State Car Dealer Licenses!</h2>
<p><font color="#FF0000" size="5">HERE'S SOME REAL PROOF:</font></p>
<p>Recently someone called me about advice because they were busted in their
state for unlicensed auto sales.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened was they lived in
Florida and had a dealer license based in another state.&nbsp;&nbsp; They
advertised a car on Craigslist.com and an undercover DMV investigator pretended
to be a customer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though he had a dealer license in another
state, when the Investigator found out that the dealer did NOT have a Florida
dealer license, the DMV slammed the guy with a civil injunction lawsuit&nbsp;
against him and if he continues to sell cars in Florida with an out-of-state
license, he will be prosecuted as well.&nbsp; That unlicensed dealer has had to
pay thousands in attorney fees for his defense.&nbsp; The investigator was nice
enough to give him a &quot;slap on the wrist&quot; with a civil suit only, but
not all investigators are that nice - you can be prosecuted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you
want to take that chance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>In many cases, it's CHEAPER to get your OWN car dealer's license than
getting an out-of-state license</h3>
<p>Why pay monthly fees to an out-of-state company when the same monthly fees
can be applied towards your OWN in-state car dealer license.&nbsp; I talk to
dealers all day and many tell me that it ended up being CHEAPER getting licensed
in their own state.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you know what the MINIMUM requirements are,
it can be done.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your state will tell you the requirements, but they
will NOT tell you the easiest, fastest and cheapest way to get your&nbsp; Car
Dealer's license.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can learn the easy, fast and cheap way here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="#FF0000"><b>EVEN DEALER AUCTIONS ARE CRACKING DOWN ON
OUT-OF-STATE LICENSES</b></font></h3>
<p>At my local Manheim dealer auction there is a huge sign that says:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;OUT OF STATE DEALERS:&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you purchase a vehicle, it MUST be exported outside of this state.&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all auctions have this policy, but the trend is for more and more
auctions to follow this rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; The auction does this per the state's
request because the state knows most out of state dealers who buy, will try to
sell that car in the state the car was purchased in.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a
back-door method that the state is using to further crack down on unlicensed
auto dealers.</p>
<p>What this means is that the dealer auction will NOT release the car to you
because you have an out of state license - you need to show the auction a bill
of lading from a trucking company that says the car is going to be transported
out of state.&nbsp;&nbsp; This can be MAJOR problem if you have an out of state
license!&nbsp; <b>Do it the right way - get a dealer license in your OWN state
in your OWN name.</b></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="5"><u>A Car Dealer License in your OWN state is
Not as Hard as You Think</u></font></h3>
<p><font size="3">When I got my license I realized it takes a little patience,
but it is NOT difficult if you are aware of what to expect and what the minimum
requirements are . In fact, the vast majority of licensed dealers don't have
huge lots and fancy signs - they do the<strong> minimum</strong><em> </em>required
to get licensed.&nbsp; The minimum requirements can be quite simple.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">I WILL SHOW YOU EXACTLY HOW TO MEET <u>MINIMUM</u>
STATE-LICENSING REQUIREMENTS!</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="5"><u>Do you <i>really</i> need my help?&nbsp;
How can my program help you?</u></font></h3>
<p><font size="3">I'm sometimes asked, can't I get the requirements online?&nbsp;
How can your program help me?</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Well, it is true - anyone can do a simple internet search and
in minutes find information about car dealer license requirements.&nbsp;
However, keep this in mind:</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>1.&nbsp; The state will give you the requirements but they
will <u>NOT</u> tell you what to do first, second, third, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>(There
is a certain order in which you need to meet the requirements if you want to
save time and money)</i></b></font></p>
<p><b>2.&nbsp; The state will <u>NOT</u> hold your hand and guide you through
the process step-by-step - That's my job!</b></p>
<p><b>3.&nbsp; The state will <u>NOT</u> show you the easiest and cheapest way
to get licensed - Again, that's my job!</b></p>
<p><b>4.&nbsp; The state will <u>NOT</u> show you how to succeed and make money
in the car business - My job again!</b></p>
<p><b>5.&nbsp; The state will <u>NOT</u> take your emails and phone calls if you
need help along the way and after you get licensed - I will!</b></p>
<p>(Don't forget:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm&nbsp; a licensed dealer and I've had my
dealer license for almost 16 years.&nbsp; I'm also a lawyer who is very familiar
with dealer laws.)</p>

<u><font size="5" color="#FF0000">T</font><font color="#FF0000" size="4">HE UNDERGROUND USED CAR BUSINESS </font></u><font size="4"></p>

<p align="left">The underground used car business is now a billion dollar
industry that
has been in existence since the advent of motor vehicles. </p>

<p align="left">Evidence of this can be seen on a daily basis - that tempting car parked
on an vacant lot or along a roadside curb with a &quot;<font color="FF0000">FOR SALE</font>&quot;
sign everyone seems to stop and curiously peer into. </p>

<p align="left">Nine times out of ten, the seller of the car is an unlicensed dealer
looking to make a fast buck.</p>

<p align="left"><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><u>WHY DO STATES
MAKE IT A CRIME? </u></font></p>

<p align="left">When someone buys and sells a car without a dealer license, the state gets
cheated out of sales tax, the IRS gets cheated out of income tax and since most unlicensed
auto sales are untraceable, an innocent buyer who gets screwed over cannot sue because in
order to sue, they must know who to sue! </p>

<p align="left"><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><u>STATES ARE NOT
DUMB- THEY KNOW </u></font></p>

<p align="left">States are fully aware the underground car business exists. However,
states also know there's not really much they can do about it. Just about the only thing
the state can do is limit the number of cars people can transfer per year. Other than
that, because there are thousands of unlicensed transactions occurring daily, states have
no choice but to turn their cheek and walk away with their hands tied behind their backs. </p>

<p align="left"><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><u>ADVANTAGES TO
THE UNLICENSED DEALER </u></font></p>

<p align="left">The greatest advantage unlicensed dealers enjoy is bypassing the
requirement of having a dealer's license.</p>

<p align="left"><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><u>DISADVANTAGES TO
THE UNLICENSED DEALER </u></font></p>

<p align="left">The greatest disadvantages are not being able to buy cars at exclusive
dealer-only car auctions and being restricted by the state limit on how many cars that can
be sold in a year.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><u>BALANCE
PROS AND CONS </u></font></p>

<p align="left">Many unlicensed dealers get licensed and earn a fantastic living.</p>

<p align="left">Others continue buying and selling cars<em> without </em>a license.</p>

<p align="left"><em>There may be good reasons for this...</em></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.
&nbsp; They cannot afford a dealer license</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.
&nbsp; They want to build up more money before getting a dealer license</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.
&nbsp; They simply are not ready to make the big move yet</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.
&nbsp; They are making plenty of money without a dealer license</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Nevertheless, all kinds of people purchase my guide:&nbsp; Licensed
dealers, unlicensed dealers, people just curious to see what goes on in the auto sales
underground, and of course... dealers who want to kill me!<br>
