    today's multi-billion dollar music business and entertainment industries, there are more
    record labels, distributors, retailers, publishers, arts organizations and product
    manufacturers actively promoting the sale and use of music than ever before. Consequently,
    a greater number of competent, highly-skilled executives will be needed to staff positions
    that meet the special demands of the industry. The Music Business and Entertainment
    Industries program prepares students for positions in all areas of the music business and
    entertainment industries, including the publishing, distribution and retailing of sheet
    music, music books and magazines; the production, distribution and sales of recorded music
    in all forms of disc and tape; the teaching of music in a variety of school/studio
    settings; the performance industry; the music instrument industry; promotion of commercial
    and noncommercial music; arts/music management, and much more. </p>
          <p>Music Business and Entertainment Industries majors take courses in general 
            academics and music business. Guest speakers from the industry frequently 
            join faculty specialists to provide instruction in current industry 
            developments. Career-oriented projects are incorporated throughout 
            the curriculum, enabling <img src="/images/MBEI.gif" width="100" height="38" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right">students 
            to gain practical experience in a variety of professional situations. 
            Students also may gain practical experience at '<a href="http://www.canerecords.com">Cane 
            Records</a>, a student-run record label that has all the components 
            of a major record company, and learn more about the industry through 
            the Music and Entertainment Industry Students Association (MEISA), 
            which publishes a monthly newsletter and hosts special panels dealing 
            with various aspects of the industry. </p>
          <p>Students continue to study their principal instrument or voice, and 
            perform in ensembles each semester. In the last year of the program, 
            Frost School of Music students may focus on the record industry or 
            arts management. All students earn a minor in business administration. 
            Students also have the option of earning a second minor in the following 
            areas in the School of Business: computer information systems, management, 
            and marketing and finance. </p>
    <p>Undergraduates may participate in an internship in a music firm during the final
    semester of their senior year. Cooperating firms include music publishers, record
    manufacturers and distributors, retail and wholesale music stores, and artist managers.
    Students not selecting the internship complete an additional semester of coursework to
    satisfy the requirements for graduation.</p>

    <p><em>&quot;During my 27 years at the UM School of Music, I was continually stimulated by
    the school's progressive approach towards music education.&nbsp; Our goal was to prepare
    &nbsp; students to meet the explosive&nbsp; revolution in communications technology that
    has changed the art, craft, and business of music almost completely. For me, it was a
    constant challenge and always a pleasure, and I enjoyed it tremendously.&quot;</em></p>
