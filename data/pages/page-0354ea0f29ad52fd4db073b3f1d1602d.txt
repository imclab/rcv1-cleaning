<p>&quot;<em>Forgotten</em> illustrates another meaning of beauty and attraction. There are places that we pass by, and they don't get much attention because they don't look glamorous.

  So, you want to be a writer? Then you&rsquo;ll enjoy Callanwolde&rsquo;s book talk and wine &amp; cheese reception from 7 to 9 pm on May 29.  You&rsquo;ll meet Callanwolde&rsquo;s Writer-In-Residence, John DeDakis, a successful writer, teacher and speaker, who will present a book reading and signing, as well as conversation about his own experiences as a journalist and novelist.</p>
<p>John is a former Senior Copy Editor on CNN&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.&rdquo; He has published two best-selling mystery-suspense novels, &quot;Fast Track&quot; and &quot;Bluff&quot;, and during his award-winning 45-year career in journalism, he has been a White House Correspondent and interviewed luminaries such as Alfred Hitchcock, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. &ldquo;Fast Track&rdquo; is the story of a young woman&rsquo;s search for purpose as she solves the mystery surrounding the car-train collision which orphaned her as an infant. The novel deals redemptively with issues of suicide, journalistic integrity, anonymous sources, and mentoring relationships. His second novel, &ldquo;Bluff,&rdquo; a sequel to &ldquo;Fast Track,&rdquo; is based on his four-day, 25-mile hike along the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru.</p>
<p>John is currently teaching Creative Writing Fiction Classes and Private Writing Sessions at Callanwolde.  &quot;Teaching at Callanwolde this spring has been an inspiring experience. The place attracts and exudes creativity,&quot; says John. </p>

PHOTOGRAPHS BY RONALD NUSE</strong><br />
The exhibit will open on Friday, June 7, with a reception for the artist from 7 to 9 pm, and run through August 30. Admission is free and the public is invited.</p>
<p>These images of nature draw from four past and present photographic series by Ron Nuse. The<em> Falling Shadows</em> series explores the hidden mystery of nature. At first glance, the images seem to be traditional landscapes but at second glance they hint at another dimension of nature not usually seen. The<em> Street Art</em> series explores how art displayed in public places interacts with its environment, including urban nature. The <em>Bamboo Pentaptych</em> series shows bamboo images in five related panels. The <em>Four Directions</em> series shows nature using the visual language of surrealism.</p>
<p>The gallery is located on the second floor of the main building in the Callanwolde mansion at 980 Briarcliff Road, Atlanta. Viewing hours are from 10 am to 8 pm, Monday through Friday, and 10 am to 3 pm on Saturday. For more information call 404-872-5338.</p>
