                <p><font face="Verdana">Shopping for a used car?
                A used car can be a bargain, but you should know
                some important facts before you buy your car.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana"><b>&quot;As Is&quot;
                Means No Warranty</b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">Only about one-half of
                all used cars sold by dealers come with a written
                warranty. The other half are sold &quot;as is,&quot;
                without a written warranty. This means that if
                you have problems with the car after you buy it,
                you must pay for any needed repairs yourself. The
                dealer has no further responsibility for the car
                once the sale is complete and you drive off the
                lot.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">If you buy a car from a
                private individual (for example, through
                classified newspaper ads), you are probably
                buying the car &quot;as is.&quot; Without a
                written contract with specific repair provisions,
                the seller in most states has no further
                responsibility for the car. Even in the few
                states that do not permit &quot;as is&quot;
                sales, the seller's only obligation, without a
                written warranty, is to sell you a car that is
                capable of providing basic transportation--nothing
                more. Of course, if you have a written contract,
                the seller must live up to the promises stated in
                the contract. Depending on its age, the car may
                be covered by a manufacturer's warranty or
                service contract. Ask the seller for details.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana"><b>Warranty Protection</b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">The used car you buy may
                come with a written warranty. Examine it
                carefully before you buy to see what is covered
                and what is not. If the dealer makes any promises
                to repair the car that are not included in your
                written warranty, ask the dealer to add those
                promises to the written warranty.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">When you buy your used
                car, look for and ask about the following:</font></p>
                <dir>
                    <li><font face="Verdana"><u>Used Car Buyers
                        Guide</u>: The Federal Trade Commission
                        requires that a Buyer's Guide be posted
                        in the window of used cars sold by
                        dealers. The guide indicates whether the
                        car is sold &quot;as is&quot; or under
                        &quot;warranty.&quot;</font><p><font
                        face="Verdana"><u>Full or Limited
                        Warranty</u>: This means that the dealer
                        will pay all or part of the total repair
                        bill for covered systems that fail during
                        the warranty period. Ask the dealer for a
                        copy of the written warranty and for an
                        explanation of the warranty's coverage,
                        exclusions, and repair obligations. Does
                        the warranty cover both parts and labor?
                        Does it cover only a percentage of the
                        repair work or all of it?</font></p>
                        <p><font face="Verdana"><u>Implied
                        Warranty</u>: Some state laws do not
                        permit dealers to sell used cars &quot;as
                        is.&quot; In those states, implied
                        warranties may give you some rights to
                        have the dealer take care of serious
                        problems that were not apparent when you
                        bought the car. Ask your state and or
                        local consumer protection office or Legal
                        Assistance attorney whether this applies
                        in your state.</font></p>
                    </li>
                </dir>
                <p><font face="Verdana"><b>Service Contract</b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">Some dealers may offer
                you a service contract. A service contract, like
                a warranty, provides repair and/or maintenance
                services for a specific time period. Unlike a
                warranty, however, a service contract costs extra.
                A service contract may overlap with warranty
                coverage. Compare the terms of any service
                contract offered to the terms of any warranty
                coverage on the used car. If you buy a service
                contract within 90 days of the time of sale, you
                may have additional rights contained in your
                state law. As with implied warranties, you should
                seek more information about how this works in
                your state. Additionally, a service contract will
                often be useless if you move out of state or
                overseas.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana"><b>Known Defects
                Disclosure</b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">If a dealer knows about a
                major defect prior to selling you a used car, the
                dealer has an obligation, under law, to disclose
                it. If the dealer knows the car is seriously
                defective and does not tell you about the defect
                prior to sale, you may be able to break the
                contract. Again, make sure to find out the
                specific rules that apply in your state.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana"><b>Independent
                Inspections</b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">Before you buy a used
                car, it is a good idea to ask the dealer if you
                may have the car inspected by an independent
                mechanic. In this way, you will have a chance to
                find out about the mechanical condition of the
                car <u>before</u> you buy it.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">Some dealers will permit
                you to take the car to an independent mechanic.
                Others may have good reasons (for example,
                insurance restrictions) for denying this request.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">With the dealer's
                permission, you can also ask an independent
                mechanic to come to the used car lot. Ask someone
                who knows about cars for the names of reputable
                mechanics. You can also find mechanics through
                advertisements, car repair establishments, and
                auto diagnostic centers in your community.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana"><b>Federal Odometer
                Requirements Act</b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">Federal law requires that
                sellers of automobiles disclose to buyers the
                accurate mileage on a car as indicated by the
                odometer or tell buyers if mileage is unknown.
                The law further provides civil penalties for
                those who intentionally violate these
                requirements. If you have purchased a used car
                and believe the mileage on the car to be higher
                than what was disclosed to you, see your legal
                assistance attorney.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana"><b>Used Car Inspection
                Checklist</b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">When you shop for a used
                car, you may find the following checklist helpful.
                Make sure you or your mechanic check for cracks,
                leaks, breaks, abnormal noises, and missing or
                inoperable parts in the systems of the car listed
                below.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Frame and body</u>:
                Is the frame straight and solid?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Engine</u>: Is
                there excessive oil leakage? Are the belts in
                place? Is the block or head cracked? Is the
                exhaust normal?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Transmission and
                drive shaft</u>: Is the transmission fluid proper
                and seepage normal? Is the transmission solid? Is
                the drive shaft in good shape?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Differential</u>:
                Does the differential operate quietly without
                excessive seepage?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Cooling system</u>:
                Does the water pump function properly? Is there
                any leakage, including any from the radiator?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Electrical system</u>:
                Does the battery leak? Do the alternator,
                generator, battery, and starter work properly?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Fuel system</u>:
                Is there any visible leakage?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Accessories</u>:
                Do gauges and warning devices work? Do the air
                conditioner, heater, and defroster work?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Brake system</u>:
                Do the warning lights work? Is the brake pedal
                firm under pressure? Does the vehicle stop in a
                straight line? Check the hoses, drum and lining
                for soundness. Are structural and mechanical
                parts solid?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Steering system</u>:
                Is there too much free play in the steering? Are
                the front wheels aligned properly? Check the
                power unit belts for cracks or slippage and the
                unit fluid levels.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Suspension system</u>:
                Are the ball joint seals intact? Are the
                structural parts solid and straight? Are springs
                and shocks properly connected? Check shock
                absorbers for leakage and loose mountings.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Tires</u>: Check
                the tread for depth of wear, the tire sizes for
                matching, and for any other obvious damage.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Wheels</u>: Look
                for any visible cracks, damage, or repairs. Check

                <p><font face="Verdana">___ <u>Exhaust system</u>:
                Check for leakage and exhaust smoke when the
                engine is running.</font></p>
