      <P><B><FONT color="#0000ff" face="Verdana" size="3">Quoting Packed or Loaded
      Payments</FONT></B><BR>
      <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Quoting &quot;packed&quot; or
      &quot;loaded&quot; payments is a deceptive practice that is commonly used
      by car dealers. (It's even taught to their salespeople in training
      seminars.) Here's how it works: When the customer asks how much the
      monthly payment would be on a particular vehicle, the salesperson gives
      them an inflated figure that represents a higher loan amount or APR. For
      example, if the correct monthly payment was $400, the customer might be
      quoted a payment of $450 instead. On a 6-year loan, this would end up costing the
      customer an additional $3,600.</FONT></P>
      
      <P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">If the customer (unknowingly) agrees to the
      inflated monthly payment, the dealer then has a number of ways to get his
      hands on the additional money. For example, the customer might be talked
      into getting one or more high-priced (and high-profit) items like an
      extended warranty or car alarm, &quot;at little-or-no extra cost.&quot;
      (At least that's what the customer is told.) Or the customer might be
      charged an APR of 11% on a loan when the going rate is only 8%, so the
      dealer can pocket the additional finance charges. And if inflated payments
      were used on a lease, the extra money could represent a secret price or
      APR increase.</FONT></P>
      
      <P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">This little scheme is frequently used to
      trick people into leases: Dealers simply quote inflated loan payments to
      make a conventional purchase look a lot more expensive than a lease. You
      can avoid this scam by using the Internet to find competitive rates on car
      loans (look for &quot;Online Auto Loans&quot; in our <B><a href="http://www.carinfo.com/newcarbuying.html">
      Money Saving Tips</a></B> page), then calculating your
      own payments.</FONT></P>
      
      
      <P><B><FONT color="#0000ff" face="Verdana" size="3">Kickbacks for Secret APR
      Increases</FONT></B><BR>
      <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">One of the car industry's dirty
      little secrets is the practice of lenders giving kickbacks to dealers for
      charging their customers higher interest rates. For example, if a lender's
      current rate on a particular loan is 8%, but the dealer charges the
      customer 10%, the dealer usually gets to keep most (if not all) of the
      additional finance charges. (On a typical 5-year loan for $20,000 that
      extra 2% adds about $20 to the monthly payment.) This is done on both
      loans and leases, and because it's done without any disclosure to the
      customer, it's a deceptive practice.</FONT></P>
      
      
      <P><B><FONT color="#0000ff" face="Verdana" size="3">The Dealer Prep Scam</FONT></B><BR>
      <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Charging customers for &quot;dealer
      prep&quot; is an old trick that's been used to pick up an easy $150 to
      $200 (or more) in extra profits. Since dealers are already being paid by
      the factory for new-car preparation, any amount that you pay for this
      service is pure profit. Don't fall for this, just refuse to pay it.</FONT></P>
      
      
      <P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">See our
      <B><A href="http://www.carinfo.com/newcarbuyingtipsblog/" target="_blank">
      NewCarBuyingTips blog</A></B> for videos of undercover investigations, car dealer tricks and
      scams, how to <a href="http://www.edmunds.com" style="text-decoration:none"

      <P><B><FONT color="#0000ff" face="Verdana" size="3">Extended Warranty
      Rip-offs</FONT></B><BR>
      <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Selling service contracts (extended
      warranties) has always been a big moneymaker for
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_dealerships_in_North_America"
      target="_blank">car dealers</a>. Since their
      customers have no idea how much markup there may be on a particular
      warranty, many dealers have been able to make as much profit on that item
      as they made on the whole car. Worse yet, instead of selling good
      factory-backed policies, some dealers have sold practically worthless
      &quot;brand X&quot; warranties at outrageous prices, just to make more
      money.</FONT></P>
      
      <P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Before the days of four-wheel drives,
      computers, and turbochargers, dealer's cost on these warranties used to be
      around $200 to $300. Today, policies for a few well-built, basic models
      (like a Toyota Corolla) may still cost the dealer less than $400, but most
      have gone up in price. For many four-wheel drives and vehicles with poor
      repair histories, the dealer's cost may be as high as $1,400 to $1,800 on
      factory-backed policies, and the typical &quot;family sedan&quot; warranty
      usually costs about $800 to $900. However, the price to the customer is
      often whatever the market will bear, so it's not unusual to see dealers
      trying to sell $900 policies for $2,000 or more.</FONT></P>
      
      <P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">As an alternative to the high prices that
      dealers often charge for their policies, reliable extended warranties can
      also be purchased from other sources. These policies are sometimes called
      &quot;service contracts,&quot; and they're available for most new vehicles
      at customer prices that are typically around $400 to $700. (Keep this in
      mind when the dealer tries to sell you his warranty for $2,000 to $3,000
      -- plus $400 or more in interest when he adds it to your car loan.)<BR>

      <P><B><FONT color="#0000ff" face="Verdana" size="3">Overpriced Car Alarms</FONT></B><BR>
      <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">The increasing popularity of car
      alarms has given dealers another opportunity to make huge profits. An
      inexpensive ignition/fuel cut-off system (which is not even a real alarm)
      typically costs the dealer less than $50 to install, but the customer's
      price is often $200 to $250. (This type uses a special key that's inserted
      under the dash to start the vehicle, but it has no real &quot;alarm&quot;
      features.) Dealers often charge at least $500 to $600 for the installation
      of a decent (full-featured) alarm system, even though their cost is closer
      to $150. And some dealers have been caught charging $2,000 to $3,000 for
      systems that were only worth about $250.</FONT></P>
      
      <P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">If you're interested in saving money on an
      alarm for your new car or truck, check the local Yellow Page listings
      under &quot;Automobile Alarm/Security Systems.&quot; A good system can
      usually be installed by an aftermarket alarm company for $200 to $250 (or
      less), and some even offer lifetime warranties.</FONT></P>
      
      <P><B><FONT color="#0000ff" face="Verdana" size="3">One-Price, No-Haggle
      Dealers</FONT></B><BR>
      <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">A &quot;revolutionary&quot; concept
      is being tested in the sale of new and used cars: fixed, no-haggle prices.
      Saturn dealers have always had this (supposedly)
      &quot;consumer-friendly&quot; policy, and now a growing number of used-car
      dealers are showing up with similar practices. Several automakers are even
      attempting to convert some of their new-car dealers to
      &quot;one-price&quot; after seeing used-car superstores like CarMax and
      AutoNation getting good customer satisfaction ratings.</FONT></P>
      
      <P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Is improved customer satisfaction the only
      motive behind this trend toward no-haggle prices? Maybe not. A recent
      survey of used-car transactions suggests another reason for dealers to
      embrace this radical change: On average, no-haggle dealers are getting
      more money for cars than dealers that allow price negotiation. How much
      more? Usually $500 to $600, sometimes as much as $1,000. (For more details
      on this survey, see &quot;And They Call This Consumer Friendly?&quot; on
      the <A href="editorial.html">CarInfo.com Editorial Page.)</A></FONT></P>
      
      <P><B><FONT color="#0000ff" face="Verdana" size="3">Warning to Car Buyers</FONT></B><BR>
      <FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Many car buyers who rely on the
      Internet as their only source of information end up paying a lot more than
      others who do a little more homework. How much more? Typically $500 to
      $600 on your average $20,000 vehicle, and sometimes as much as $1,500.
      (Even more on higher-priced cars.) Why are these people paying so much
      more -- for the same vehicles? And <B>what secrets do the &quot;smart
      shoppers&quot; have</B> that enable them to get better deals? <B>INFORMATION!</B>
      Car buyers with the best information get the best deals, and smart
      shoppers know how -- and where -- to get the best information. (They also
      don't mind paying for it.)</FONT></P>
      
      <P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Too many people make the mistake of
      thinking that all they need is the magic &quot;dealer invoice&quot; number
      to get the best deal. Thinking that &quot;dealer invoice&quot; is the same
      as &quot;dealer cost&quot; is mistake #1, which is usually followed by
      mistake #2: thinking that they can always get accurate dealer cost
      information on the Internet, for free. Mistake #3 is not knowing the
      actual prices that &quot;smart shoppers&quot; are paying for the same
      vehicle. Mistake #4: thinking that a dealer who belongs to an Internet
      buying program is going to give them the lowest price in town. Mistake #5:
      not researching loan and lease rates before visiting the dealer. Mistake
      #6: believing the dealer when he says, &quot;The best rate I can give you
      on a loan (or lease) is X%.&quot; Mistake #7: not knowing how to calculate
      their own loan/lease payments. Mistake #8: buying a service contract from
      the dealer at the quoted price. Mistake #9...Are you beginning to get the
      picture? <B>There's a lot more to getting a great deal</B> than most
      people realize, and you're not going to find <B>all</B> the information
      you'll need in a Web site.</FONT></P>
      
      <P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Here's a true story of mistakes made by one
      Web-surfing car buyer: &quot;Fred&quot; works in the computer industry and
      is an experienced Web surfer. When he mentioned to a friend that he was in
      the market for a new car, his friend told him about a car buying book he
      had read and how much money he had saved by following its advice -- which
      included paying for <B>accurate</B> &quot;dealer cost&quot; information.
      But Fred thought that was silly because he knew how to find everything on
      the Internet, for free. (Or so he thought.)</FONT></P>
      
      <P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">When Fred was ready to buy, he used a
      popular Web site to get his free &quot;dealer cost&quot; numbers. Then he
      went to the dealer to make an offer. After a little haggling, the dealer
      agreed to sell the car for $800 over invoice, stating that &quot;normally,
      we like to make more than $800 on a car, but we'll accept your
      offer.&quot; Since <B>Fred thought the dealer was only making $800</B>, he
      was convinced that he was getting a great deal. What he didn't know was
      that the dealer's <B>real cost</B> was a lot lower than invoice due to
      secret dealer incentives that were worth about $1,300. (So the dealer made
      $2,100 on Fred's car, not $800.) And he also didn't know that other people
      (the smart shoppers) were buying the same vehicle for hundreds below
      invoice. <B>The bottom line: Fred overpaid by at least $1,000</B> because
      he tried to save a few bucks by using free &quot;dealer cost&quot;
      information.</FONT><BR>
