				<h3 class="post-title">Jack White&#8217;s Ex-Wife Karen Elson Gets Restraining Order Against White</h3>
		
				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/jackwhite2.jpg"><br />
Update: TMZ has posted emails sent from White to Elson. Among other things, they confirm that the musician whose children White does not want his children associating with is Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys. He writes, &#8220;That&#8217;s a possible twelve fucking years I&#8217;m going to have to be sitting in kids chairs next to that asshole with other people trying to lump us in together. He gets yet another free reign to follow me around and copy me and push himself into my world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Model and musician Karen Elson has filed a restraining order against her ex-husband, Jack White, Nashville City Paper reports. White and Elson have been fighting over custody of their two children, daughter Scarlett and son Henry Lee, and Elson alleges that White has been harassing her.</p>
<p>According to City Paper, the restraining order states, &#8220;Wife fears for her and the children’s safety as a result of this harassment.&#8221; It also says, &#8220;This pattern of husband’s bullying wife into submission was a contributing factor in the demise of their marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The order was served on July 22. White is permitted to communicate with Elson only over email and is not allowed to have &#8220;any contact with wife whatsoever except as it relates to parenting time with the parties&#8217; minor children.&#8221; </p>
<p>City Paper describes two incidents of alleged harassment:<br />
White wanted Elson to contact their kids’ private school in an effort to get their kids out of a class in which another entertainer’s child was present. White said that he feels that entertainer &#8216;ripped off&#8217; his music, the order said. In another incident, White berated Elson when she attended the wedding of a rival musician. Again, he was upset because this entertainer also &#8216;ripped off&#8217; his music, according to the order. The musician was unnamed in the court filing.</p>
<p>According to City Paper, the next hearing in the custody case is on August 29. Elson&#8217;s lawyer told City Paper that &#8220;both sides have been working to settle the dispute privately.&#8221;</p>
<p>White and Elson were married from 2005 to 2011. When they announced their divorce, they threw a party. The invitation said, &#8220;We remain dear and trusted friends and co-parents to our wonderful children Scarlett and Henry Lee. We feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow.&#8221;</p>

				<h3 class="post-title">Edward Sharpe &#038; The Magnetic Zeros: Edward Sharpe &#038; The Magnetic Zeros (Album Review)</h3>
		
				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/musicnote.jpg"><br />
California 10-piece Edward Sharpe &#038; The Magnetic Zeros somehow embodies the ultimate modern-hippie stereotype while still exuding a refreshing authenticity. The mostly bearded men and long-haired women in the folksy collective unabashedly don their retro influences (think floral prints, scarves, feathers and floppy hats) while performing, and their live show truly encapsulates the uninhibited, collaborative celebration of music.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate, then, that the band’s third album sounds so restrained. Ringleader Alex Ebert produced the album and sonically, Edward Sharpe &#038; The Magnetic Zeros feels slick and compressed. The jangly guitars, playful percussion and strange psychedelic feedback that zoomed across headphones in stereo on the band’s 2009 debut Up From Below aren’t necessarily absent on this record, but they’re certainly buried in the production. Particularly, the end of the album feels like a depository for mellow ballads, during which Ebert’s singing veers closer to a low-voiced drone.</p>
<p>The self-titled record is not all polished constraint though. Ebert’s blinding optimism shines on the three-peat “Let’s Get High,” “Two” and “Please!” each following its predecessor’s quirky cheer. “Country Calling,” a tune about leaving Los Angeles, plays up the raucousness through sporadic guitar fills and comical, Beatles-esque sound effects. Even “If I Were Free,” which would actually feel appropriate on the The Lion King soundtrack, brings a romping fun to the record.</p>
<p>The album kicker, however, the song that seems to both defend and capitulate to these sonic choices, is the candidly conciliatory “Life Is Hard.” As Ebert earnestly beckons, “come celebrate, life is hard,” it’s difficult not to want to join him and his merry pranksters, at least on part of this record.</p>

				<h3 class="post-title">JACK WHITE&#8217;S $200,000 GIFT WILL HELP CONGRESS CONVERT THEIR 8-TRACKS&#8230;</h3>
		
				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/jackwhite.jpg"><br />
Jack White has just donated $200,000 to the National Recording Preservation Foundation. The inaugural gift will help publicly launch the foundation as well as set the National Recording Preservation Plan in motion. The plan follows a 2000 congressional act that aims to catalog and preserve the United States’ recording history. Part of White’s donation will go towards converting an 8-track collection to digital, among other other things. However, time is of the essence, according to Executive Director Gerald Seligman. Via Washington Post:</p>
<p>“It’s thrilling,” Executive Director Gerald Seligman said, to be able to publicly launch the foundation. He cited White and foundation board members as extremely committed to preservation.</p>
<p>“Here we have a whole nation of cultural heritage in recorded sound [and] a lot of it is in precarious shape,” Seligman said. “Some was recorded on very fragile media — like old cylinders, acetates, reel-to-reel tapes — and it’s turning into shards.”</p>
<p>Now that preservation is underway, he said, time is of the essence: “Some of these things have got to be saved quick.”</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/beastieboys.jpg"><br />
Mike D in a recent interview:<br />
“Now I’m going to sound like a name-dropping asshole, but it all came about thanks to the director and my friend and longtime associate, Spike Jonze,” Diamond explains to Rolling Stone via cell phone as he drives home in Los Angeles after dropping his kids off at basketball camp. “Spike vouched for [Kenzo co-head designer Humberto Leon]. I was a little apprehensive. It might shock you, but I haven’t been to that many fashion shows, and I’d never done a commissioned piece for a fashion house. In my own naïveté I expected I’d be talking to, like, Will Ferrell’s character in Zoolander, which turned out not to be the case at all with Humberto. The show itself, meanwhile, turned out to be a full-on theatrical experience held in a circus school in the outskirts of Paris – to come back to Zoolander, it wasn’t just dudes walking down a runway in a tent. It was the type of artful shit you never get to do in New York, where fashion shows are all about just money.”<br />

					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/musicnote.jpg"><br />
The long list has been whittled down, and today, the short list has been announced for the 2013 Polaris Music Prize. The honor for best album of the year by a Canadian artist could go to nominees including Purity Ring&#8217;s Shrines, Godspeed You! Black Emperor&#8217;s Allelujah! Don&#8217;t Bend! Ascend!, Metz&#8217;s Metz, Metric&#8217;s Synthetica, Tegan and Sara&#8217;s Heartthrob, Colin Stetson&#8217;s New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light, Young Galaxy&#8217;s Ultramarine, and others. Mac DeMarco, Daphni, Majical Cloudz, and Rhye were among the long list artists that were snubbed. The winner will be announced at the Polaris Gala on September 23. Last year&#8217;s award went to Feist for Metals. The prize winner is selected by a large panel of Canadian journalists and broadcasters. The winner receives $30,000.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/radiohead.jpg"><br />
Thom Yorke and Radiohead might be one of the biggest bands, well, of all time, but that doesn’t mean he’s forgotten what it feels like to start from the bottom. Actually, he remembers so well, he just pulled all his Atoms for Peace music and solo work from the Spotify playlists in a move of solidarity with new and underpaid artists.</p>
<p>He and his close friend, producer and Atoms for Peace collaborator Nigel Goodrich explain their reasoning via Pitchfork:</p>
<p>In a series of tweets, Godrich explained that the move is in protest of Spotify’s business model. “The reason is that new artists get paid fuck all with this model. It’s an equation that just doesn’t work,” he writes.</p>
<p>Yorke added, “Make no mistake new artists you discover on #Spotify will not get paid. meanwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it. Simples.”</p>
<p>Goodrich continued that such a move was vital to the protection of creativity in music.</p>
<p>“If people had been listening to spotify instead of buying records in 1973… I doubt very much if [Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon] would have been made.. It would just be too expensive.”</p>

				<h3 class="post-title">Jay Z- Magna Carta Holy Grail (Album Review)</h3>
		
				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/jayz.jpg"><br />
Magna Carta… Holy Grail isn’t going to stop being divisive any time soon. That much I think we can say with certainty. Opinions on just about every moment on this record appear up for grabs, in part thanks to a engagingly distracting marketing plan involving Samsung and #newrules. One of the #newrules #TeamHov seemed to overlook in this increasingly bizarre release strategy is that, by cutting a majority of one’s rabid fanbase out of the zeitgeist moment, you invite a torrenting typhoon. Torrent Freak reported record-breaking transfer rates for the album, which Jay-Z’s team may have been able to spin positively if not for the fact pirating out of a phone app led to all kinds of audio artifacting and general lossy files misbehavior.</p>
<p>For many, this album will probably always be defined by that sepia-toned version of the record, which is a shame because in its full splendor Magna Carta… Holy Grail actually serves quite a few of the masters folks have been complaining Jay’s been uninterested in since the release of Blueprint 3. He makes some very odd choices subject matter-wise, and it’s undeniable that there are verses on here (that we’ll get to a little later) that just… end. Jay’s newly-energetic bounce (reminiscent of his Volume 2 / Volume 3 period) dramatically peters out long before the bridge or chorus comes around and the artiste embarrassingly self-satisfied with mediocre language. But there are other moments where Jay is so candid and honest about the way he feels about the dichotomous way his present relates to his past…</p>
<p>For example, the final verse on “Picasso Baby” is a little wandering and doesn’t even feel all that true in terms of how police officers respond to Jay’s presence, but his paranoia over the way anonymous citizens disparage his daughter is very real, as is his disappointment in the ways people keep telling him to hang up his headphones just because he’s on the wrong end of 40. One could also point to the way Jay-Z closes “Crown”, another paranoia-ridden track about his trepidation towards success, and see Jay mining similar territory as the conscious-vs-material arguments scattered throughout 2004’s The Black Album.</p>
<p>The problem is that, much like Yeezus, a finely captivating performance and some of the cleanest, more interesting production of the year is marred by some of the most vain vocals a hip-hop listener can expect to hear. Jay will stumble upon lovely little moments of language (“Boat dock in front of Hermes picking cotton”, “See me in shit you never saw / If it wasn’t for these pictures you wouldn’t see me at all” in “Oceans”) but against the entirety of a verse with useless cocaine references and glanced-at allusions to the Middle Passage and juxtaposing Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit” against July 4th, the Samsung phone release date of the album, they are just moments of coincidence. At every turn you can hear hints of Jay-Z’s slight discomfort over having become a brand, a consumable for the public to chew up and spit out. It’s just, Lamborghinis and Basquiats keep getting in the way, and who is any modern human being to blame another for succumbing to distraction, he asks.</p>
<p>There’s really no shame in Jay-Z rapping about the life he’s been describing ever since “comeback” record Kingdom Come. I don’t particularly care that I can’t relate to “going ape at the auction” or “blue bloods… trying to clown on me”. The issue with Magna Carta…Holy Grail lies in a lack of subtlety best exemplified by the opening track, the Justin Timberlake dominated “Holy Grail”. Tucked into the middle of the song is an exceptionally engaging Jay-Z moment complete with a super funky breakdown near the end, which Jay wastes on stringing a series of “niggas” together as rhyme like his protegé, J. Cole. But for most of it’s five and a half minutes, we’ve got Justin Timberlake wandering around, warbling about some woman neither of these men are dealing with (unless we’re to believe Jessica Biel and Beyoncé are some kind of succubi) in the dark.</p>
<p>What makes coming to a conclusion about Magna Carta… Holy Grail distressing is that despite all of these complaints, for 58 minutes I’m finding it hard to argue there are much more entertaining albums out there this year. Jay-Z’s on his C-game a lot of the time here as far as the words, but in terms of presence and performance it’s hard to find a more engaged Jay-Z at any point in the post-Young Chris era. Hearing him awkwardly repurpose early ‘90s indie rock in an effort to prove he’s not just talking shit in interviews is goofy, but I’ve got to enjoy that about this Jay-Z, a 43-year old half-a-billionaire singing Nirvana lyrics earnestly on an album only money could buy. His attempts to mine memes out of his subjects, such as “Somewhere in America’s” “twerk Miley, Miley twerk”  coda, are almost always clumsy but his conviction in them is always admirable.</p>
<p>In the end, Magna Carta… Holy Grail has to be a disappointment if only because Timbaland (with Jerome Harmon’s helping hand) handling most of the music here and that not resulting in a chasm of god-awful pop-tart garbage is tantamount to any number of small miracles, and yet Jay-Z rewards that effort with his least-concentrated set of lyrics maybe ever. But the album doesn’t seem as though it will be able to exist on those terms; it’s instead being measured by the amount of times we can refer to Jay-Z’s many corporate sponsorships and 1%er business opportunities, in all the ways we can find to praise what Jay-Z represents to the pop world while belittling all that he does with that power. Magna Carta… Holy Grail lacks the year-defining singles that made Blueprint 3 evade “flop” status, but it’s undeniably the most cohesive thing Jay’s been a part of since the original Blueprint.</p>
<p>At 43 years old, Jay-Z’s made an exceptionally contemporary hip-hop album that succeeds on every leg but the one Jay’s always most readily admitted he struggles standing on for long periods of time. As a fun, interesting summer solstice I believe the guy’s done his job, and honest to God Jay-Z fans shouldn’t have much to be worried about with this release. It’s the folks that hide behind Samsung as an excuse to dislike #MCHG, rather than blame Jay-Z directly as a rapper, that fear this album and vice versa. It’s fun to throw unironic quotes around his infamous, “I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man” one-liner and wax poetic about what that means for his art, but let’s not forget there’s actually an album here that Jay-Z clearly had a concrete vision and excitement for, or that hip-hop royalty in 2013 encompasses a fair amount more than on-paper lyricism.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, Jay-Z probably just can’t carry an entire album anymore if you’re a lyrics head. But Jay was always custom built for a world where beats take precedence over rhymes—one could argue he’s the most influential artist in birthing that formula—and Magna Carta is that quite explicitly. I’m willing to be fine with that.</p>

				<h3 class="post-title">SUB POP CELEBRATE THEIR SILVER JUBILEE&#8230;</h3>
		
				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/marshall.jpg"><br />
To celebrate their 25th anniversary (wow, do we feel old), Sub Pop Records is throwing a massive concert this Saturday that will shut down an entire street in Seattle. The mini-festival will feature performances from the label’s esteemed roster, a comedy showcase, as well as a panel discussion covering the early days of Sub Pop with co-founders Jonathan Poneman and Bruce Pavitt. Via Rolling Stone:</p>
<p>The venerable label is even closing down a major Seattle road for the all-day festival, featuring performances from Built to Spill, long-time Sub Pop act Mudhoney, J. Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. and Greg Dulli of Afghan Whigs, among others. Poneman promised the festival will be a “quintessentially Seattle experience” for locals and visitors who are coming from around the world. He noted he measures the Sub Pop anniversary milestone from 1988, when he and co-founder Bruce Pavitt started to run the label full-time.</p>
<p>“We’re just gonna play songs,” says Mark Arm, vocalist-guitarist of Mudhoney. “Nothing too insane. We’re not gonna be pulling frogs out of our asses or anything.”</p>
<p>Oh, bummer. Well, since Sub Pop is still an integral part of the Seattle music scene, we still recommend going – even if you won’t be treated to any amphibious foreplay.<br />

				<h3 class="post-title">Jason Isbell- Southeastern (Album Review)</h3>
		
				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/tele.jpg"><br />
Jason Isbell has always been closely associated with the groups he’s been a part of: Drive-By Truckers and, more recently, The 400 Unit, with whom he’s released two albums. While members of the latter step in to back him up on Southeastern, for the first time since his 2007 solo debut, Sirens Of The Ditch, listeners are able to hear an unfiltered representation of this Alabamian prodigy, and the results are so stellar it’s not hyperbole to say that he could be his generation’s answer to Steve Earle.  </p>
<p>Thankfully, unlike Earle, Isbell learned to face his demons relatively early, and that tone is immediately set via the opener “Cover Me Up,” an acoustic number that sees Isbell’s voice soaring above twangy flourishes as he confesses, “I sobered up and I swore off that stuff forever this time.” While most artists are scared that sobriety will hinder their writing, it seems as if it’s inspired Isbell to write some of his most personal songs to date. (Marrying Amanda Shires, who plays fiddle and sings on “Traveling Alone,” probably didn’t hurt, either.) It’s always been difficult to tell fact from the fiction with Isbell since his writing is steeped in so much Southern mythology. That tendency, which defines some his most popular DBT songs like “Decoration Day,” is continued on “Flying Over Water,” which sees him revisiting his roots to recount a story of “Daddy’s little empire / Built by hands and built by slaves.” Things may get sweaty when Isbell sings, “In the heat I saw you rising from the dirt,” but listeners can feel that burn when he rips a distortion-drenched guitar solo during the song’s climax. Country music is a genre where authenticity is paramount and there’s no question that when Isbell sings about topics that might be foreign to city dwellers, it comes from a place of experience. Even when the protagonist has a different name—like Andy on “Elephant,” a somber ballad that tells the story of his friendship with a terminally ill woman with sharecropper eyes—there’s something in Isbell’s voice that’s hauntingly honest when he sings about doing his best to “try to ignore the elephant somehow.” As a respite, these types of sentiments are broken up by the occasional fun honky-tonk like “Super 8,” but for the most part Southeastern is pretty serious business. Then again, so is life and the one that Isbell has lived thus far is certainly worth documenting, especially when the songs supporting it are this stunning.</p>

But, how can we be sure those are her butts? More details from NME:</p>
<p>Peter Doherty has revealed that he is planning to sell rock’n'roll memorabilia from a stall in Camden, including cigarette butts smoked by Amy Winehouse and Kate Moss.</p>
<p>The Babyshambles frontman revealed the plan to NME as part of an interview you can read in full in the new issue of the magazine, on newsstands now. Discussing his money making scheme, Doherty says: “I’ve got fag butts that belong to Bobby Gillespie, Kate Moss and Amy Winehouse, and I’ve got Christmas paper that [former Coventry City goalkeeper] Steve Ogrizovic sent to the guy from Black Sabbath. All kinds of shit, basically.”</p>
<p>That’s not really – for him.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/bass.jpg"><br />
With Sonic Youth broken up, Kim Gordon has been focusing on Body/Head, her noise guitar duo with Massachusetts artist Bill Nace. After a string of hard-to-find LPs in small pressings, they&#8217;ve now announced Coming Apart, their most widely distributed release yet. The 2xLP/CD is out September 10 via Matador in North America and September 16 in the UK/Europe. That&#8217;s the cover art, above.</p>
<p>Beginning as an instrumental project, Gordon now also sings in Body/Head. According to Matador, &#8220;They have even started writing and playing &#8216;songs&#8217; now, compositionally distinct from their purely aleatory origins, but still featuring lots of built-in improvisational space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Body/Head have collaborated live with Ikue Mori of DNA and released a collaborative LP with the Dead C&#8217;s Michael Morley through Feeding Tube Records.</p>
<p>Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo have also released new albums through Matador since news broke that Sonic Youth was on pause (due to Moore and Gordon&#8217;s separation).</p>

				<h3 class="post-title">R.I.P. Alan Myers, Drummer With Devo</h3>
		
				<div class="entry">
					<p><img src="http://www.kingblind.com/images/drum.jpg"><br />
Alan Myers, who drummed with Devo for a decade, has died, reports Slicing Up Eyeballs. &#8220;The Human Metronome&#8221; had been battling cancer. Myers joined the band in 1976, replacing Jim Mothersbaugh, and left in 1985, during the writing of 1988&#8242;s Total Devo. He was replaced by Sparks&#8217; David Kendrick.</p>
<p>He also drummed on Devo&#8217;s 1978 debut, Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo, 1979&#8242;s Duty Now for the Future, 1980&#8242;s Freedom of Choice, 1981&#8242;s New Traditionalists, 1982&#8242;s Oh, No! It&#8217;s Devo, and 1984&#8242;s Shout.</p>
<p>In a 1995 interview with Q Magazine (via Rocksbackpages), Myers explained his reasons for leaving the band&#8211; largely believed to be due to his frustration with the introduction of the Fairlight synthesizer and mechanized drum parts. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t moving more in line with the earlier, more unique material, with a variety of reasons.&#8221; After quitting Devo, a friend got him into construction, and Myers subsequently established his own electrical contractors, Skyline Electric, a name he also used for a late-period band. He had also got involved with meditation, citing it as &#8220;a form of [Devo's theory of] de-evolution because it takes you from the physical to the conscious to the super-conscious. I&#8217;ve found that the purpose of having a body is to show that the physical world is an illusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founding Devo member Gerald Casale paid tribute to his former bandmate:</p>
<p>“In praise of Alan Myers, the most incredible drummer I had the privilege to play with for 10 years. Losing him was like losing an arm. RIP!! I begged him not to quit Devo. He could not tolerate being replaced by the Fairlight and autocratic machine music. I agreed. Alan, you were the best – a human metronome and then some. A once in a lifetime find thanks to Bob Mothersbaugh. U were born to drum Devo!”</p>
<p>Current member Josh Freese also paid his respects: “RIP Alan Myers. 1 of my all time favs. An underrated/brilliant drummer. Such an honor playing his parts w/Devo. Godspeed Human Metronome.”</p>
