According to reliable source, Kate informed that her new dress was inspired by her new solo “Roar”.</p>
<p>It is informed that Katy wore a leopard print dress that was length up to her knee. Across the top of the dress, there were complete fur-esque pieces. In an interview, Katy stated to Coco Jones, the correspondent of Access Hollywood that she ordered the dress on the purpose of her new album.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6974" src="//celeblowdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Katy-Perry-MTV-277x500.jpg" alt="" width="277" height="500" />Moreover, Katy also expressed information about “Roar” that is performed on a stage under the Brooklyn Bridge. The scenario was set in such a way that it appeared to look like boxing ring.</p>
<p>The singer is of the opinion that the inspiration behind the song is to express the feelings of self realization. It is evident that in most of the cases the songs speaks about bullying and some related subject. That is undoubtedly significant while sometimes one became the biggest bully of oneself.</p>
<p>Katy further informed that sometimes an individual finds him or herself in the center of attraction of his or her life. In the period, personal relationship and success of an individual becomes the most important factor of the life.</p>
<p>She also informed that the songs of this album are the result of her self realization. She told that she suddenly realizes that personally she was little bit immature. This realization encourages Katy to gain strength and enable her to write the songs that reveals the thoughts of herself.</p>

						<span class="read-more">Read more on "Lady Gaga Calls Perez Hilton &#8220;Sick Stalker&#8221; on Twitter" &raquo;</span><p>Perez Hilton and Lady Gaga are engrossed in a Twitter quarrel. According to a source, the renowned singer states that the celebrity gossip foundation is harassing herself as well as her family. </p>
<p>The singer criticized the gossip blogger for criticizing the music of the singer as well as her unabashed love for Katy Perry. She strongly stated that the sole aim of her life is to produce music and make people happy. </p>
<p><img src="//celeblowdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lady-GaGa-and-Perez-Hilton-500x335.jpg" alt="Lady-GaGa-and-Perez-Hilton" width="500" height="335" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6965" />Referring to the injury in hip that took place in the early part of the year and forced the artists to cancel her trip, she stated on the Twitter that Perez sent her a text message at the day of her accidents. </p>
<p>It is certain that a high amount of tensions are running between them, but it is overdriven while Gaga was informed by her fan that Hilton was spotted at her apartment building. Gaga supposedly verified that with the security and then attacked Hilton on Twitter and wrote to keep distance from her and her family. </p>
<p>She further added that with the intention to harass her, Hilton is going to rent an apartment in the building. She pleaded to leave her alone as being a human being she has a certain limit of patience and endurance power. </p>
<p>Perez directly responded by re-twittering addressing his quarrel with Gaga. He wrote that he was very shocked and hurt to find that his good friend Gaga, whom he used to call in the name “wifey”, was making some false allegations about him publicly. He also added that these imaginary and defamatory allegations have put him in a false position. He also suggested Gaga’s fans to buy her music to show their support to her instead of sending death threats.</p>

						<span class="read-more">Read more on "Kirsten Storms Expecting a Baby Girl from her Marriage with Brandon Barash" &raquo;</span><p>Actors of the popular soap ‘General Hospital’, Brandon Barash and Kirsten Storms, who had recently exchanged vows, are expecting their first child. According to sources, the couple is expecting a baby girl and is equally excited to wait for the D-day.</p>
<p>The expected baby girl is due in coming on January 2013. The information was confirmed by Brandon who had earlier appeared for an interview to the ‘People’. The actor was very excited to inform about their solemn marriage ceremony last June and their excitement on hearing the news of new member coming to their family at the dawn of New Year.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6962" src="//celeblowdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Kirsten-Storms-500x281.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" />The ‘General Hospital’ actor, Kirsten Storms even tweeted about the matter and confirmed the information. Both actors are heartily moved by the overwhelming response they are getting from their fans.</p>
<p>Brandon even added that they took extreme caution to keep the news away from media glare. The couple was highly interested to keep matters simple and avoid any tension or rush as they feared that anything might turn out to be wrong during the initial trimester. The star however mentioned that his wife had a rocking time visiting the hospital timely.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, Kirsten even tweeted that Bradford Anderson, who is presently playing the character of Spinelli, will even become an ‘honorary uncle’ of her expected child. However, when asked about the same subject over Twitter, Brandon simply rubbished the matter as a joke.</p>
<p>‘Access’ reported that the pregnancy event of Kirsten would not be featured in the show for ‘GH’.</p>

The latter had her share of hard life. So, the advices she gave to Ethan came quite naturally. Ethan too is quite impressed with the guidance, which is clearly evident from the fact that he is overwhelmed. He stated that had he received those advices earlier in his life he would have avoided making so many mistakes.</p>
<p>Talking about his marital life, he said that he took the major decision to stop himself from going out of control. His early success had made him bohemian. So, Ethan decided to draw a line to put a check on his wayward actions. But his verdict proved to be wrong. Consequently, he concluded that a man will never stop leading an unruly life until he is twenty eight. Ethane Hawke was certain of his failure in marriage. He had given up all his ideas of being happy in nuptial bonds. He grew to be fond of Derek Jeter’s optimistic words. The baseball star commented that he plays for the New York Yankees. In addition, as long as he continues to do so he would remain single.</p>

						<span class="read-more">Read more on "Prince Avalanche – A Poetic Movie Failing to Capture Audience Attention" &raquo;</span><p>Prince Avalanche, an original film having endearing spirit, which is rather indescribable. The characters and their uncomfortable predicament are certainly hard to forget. Yet, a series of endless quiet frames and long footages of natural landscape turns out to be monotonous. A relatively loose remake of Either Way, an Icelandic movie released on 2011, Prince Avalanche certainly fails to offer anything special in comparison to the original one.</p>
<p>The story of the movie, directed by David Gordon Green, revolves around two protagonists, who are road workers. They are on a duty to repaint yellow lines down the middle of a rural stretch on Texas highway, after the region is ravaged by a dangerous wildfire.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6949" src="//celeblowdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/David-Gordon-Green-500x333.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" />Paul Rudd plays the character of Alvin who is the romantic boss equipped with appreciation for solitude and filled with wilderness skills. Alvin engages to compose long missives for girlfriend, Madison. He indulges in musing the serene tranquility and beauty of Mother Nature. The dimwitted brother of Madison, Lance (played by Emile Hirsch) is a party animal, highly obsessed with sex. He doesn’t enamor with natural wonders, but is interested to visit town in order to get laid.</p>
<p>A prominent scene entraps the encounter between Alvin and an elderly woman, searching for lost memories in the ashes of her charred house. This particular scene is notable since the scene is realistic with real character under real situation of a forest fire at Bastrop County at Texas, in 2011. However, the plot eventually sweeps away in monologues of a burnt forest. However, the film captures the depth of simplicity of the immature character of Hirsch.</p>
