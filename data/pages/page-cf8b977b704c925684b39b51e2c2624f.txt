					Car repair &quot;philosophy&quot;			</h2></div>
	<div class="article_content">
<p>To call car repairing a philosophy seems a bit funny. But like any job you want to do properly, it's best if you know what your doing all the way through.</p>
<p>In our site, we give emphasis on drivers helping themselves and making safe minor or major car repair. For reasons of safety and more quality repair we appeal to all our visitors, if they can and want, to widen there knowledge about cars, car systems and how they work, both single and combined together.</p>
<p>So, our very first advice to you is, if you want to do some repairs, learn more about your car and the car systems. There's no quality car repair without knowing the basics about the car systems. The car is a machine that is made out of various different systems, that combined together, give the possibility of driving.</p>
<p>For example, it doesn't hurt, while doing a rather simple task (<a href="/Basic-Car-Repair/how-to-change-air-filter-on-the-air-intake.html"><strong>like changing the air filter</strong></a>) to know what's it's purpose, what it's connected to and so on.</p>

<p>Have you ever had that helpless feeling on the road, when you have car trouble and you cant help yourself? Had to wait for road service or for someone to stop, who perhaps knows more about cars then you, so that they can help you out?</p>
<p>Well, this site and its contents are dedicated to those people, who want to know more about their car, want to know how to help themselves on the road in case of an emergency and want to be more or less independent when they go on a road trip.</p>
<p>Remember, knowing more about your car means more safety on the road and more independence (meaning the ability to help yourselves). On our website and in our video advice we will show you some basic repairs, checks etc. which YOU&nbsp; can do with a small amount of money or nothing at that and be able to get yourselves out of an emergency situation (or perhaps avoid in all).</p></div>
