aptitude. </FONT><LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automotive 
service technicians and mechanics must continually adapt to changing technology 
and repair techniques as vehicle components and systems become increasingly sophisticated. 
</FONT></LI></UL><TABLE CLASS=SectionHead WIDTH="100%"> <TBODY> <TR> <TH CLASS=ProgramHead ALIGN=left WIDTH="35%">Nature 
of the Work</TH></TR> </TBODY> </TABLE><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone 
whose car or light truck has broken down knows the importance of the jobs of automotive 
service technicians and mechanics. The ability to diagnose the source of a problem 
quickly and accurately requires good reasoning ability and a thorough knowledge 
of automobiles. Many technicians consider diagnosing hard-to-find troubles one 
of their most challenging and satisfying duties.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
work of automotive service technicians and mechanics has evolved from mechanical 
repair to a high technology job. As a result, these workers are now usually called 
technicians in automotive services and the term mechanic is falling into disuse. 
Today, integrated electronic systems and complex computers run vehicles and measure 
their performance while on the road. Technicians must have an increasingly broad 
base of knowledge about how vehicles complex components work and interact, as 
well as the ability to work with electronic diagnostic equipment and computer-based 
technical reference materials.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automotive 
service technicians use their high-tech skills to inspect, maintain, and repair 
automobiles and light trucks that run on gasoline, ethanol and other alternative 
fuels, such as electricity. The increasing sophistication of automotive technology 
now requires workers who can use computerized shop equipment and work with electronic 
components while maintaining their skills with traditional hand tools. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
mechanical or electrical troubles occur, technicians first get a description of 
the symptoms from the owner or, if they work in a large shop, from the repair 
service estimator or service advisor who wrote the repair order. To locate the 
problem, technicians use a diagnostic approach. First, they test to see whether 
components and systems are proper and secure. Then, they isolate the components 
or systems that could not logically be the cause of the problem. For example, 
if an air-conditioner malfunctions, the technicians diagnostic approach can pinpoint 
a problem as simple as a low coolant level or as complex as a bad drive-train 
connection that has shorted out the air conditioner. Technicians may have to test 
drive the vehicle or use a variety of testing equipment, such as onboard and hand-held 
diagnostic computers or compression gauges, to identify the source of the problem. 
These tests may indicate whether a component is salvageable or whether a new one 
is required to get the vehicle back in working order.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
routine service inspections, technicians test and lubricate engines and other 
major components. In some cases, the technician may repair or replace worn parts 
before they cause breakdowns that could damage critical components of the vehicle. 
Technicians usually follow a checklist to ensure that they examine every critical 
part. Belts, hoses, plugs, brake and fuel systems, and other potentially troublesome 
items are among those closely watched.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Service 
technicians use a variety of tools in their workpower tools, such as pneumatic 
wrenches to remove bolts quickly; machine tools like lathes and grinding machines 
to rebuild brakes; welding and flame-cutting equipment to remove and repair exhaust 
systems, and jacks and hoists to lift cars and engines. They also use common hand 
tools, such as screwdrivers, pliers, and wrenches, to work on small parts and 
in hard-to-reach places.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Computers 
also have become commonplace in modern repair shops. Service technicians compare 
the readouts from computerized diagnostic testing devices with the benchmarked 
standards given by the manufacturer of the components being tested. Deviations 
outside of acceptable levels are an indication to the technician that further 
attention to an area is necessary. A shops computerized system provides automatic 
updates to technical manuals and unlimited access to manufacturers service information, 
technical service bulletins, and other databases that allow technicians to keep 
current on problem spots and to learn new procedures.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automotive 
service technicians in large shops have increasingly become specialized. For example, 
<I>transmission technicians and rebuilders</I> work on gear trains, couplings, 
hydraulic pumps, and other parts of transmissions. Extensive knowledge of computer 
controls, the ability to diagnose electrical and hydraulic problems, and other 
specialized skills are needed to work on these complex components, which employ 
some of the most sophisticated technology used in vehicles. <I>Tuneup technicians 
</I>adjust the ignition timing and valves, and adjust or replace spark plugs and 
other parts to ensure efficient engine performance. They often use electronic 
testing equipment to isolate and adjust malfunctions in fuel, ignition, and emissions 
control systems.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Automotive 
air-conditioning repairers</I> install and repair air-conditioners and service 
their components, such as compressors, condensers, and controls. These workers 
require special training in Federal and State regulations governing the handling 
and disposal of refrigerants. <I>Front-end mechanics </I>align and balance wheels 
and repair steering mechanisms and suspension systems. They frequently use special 
alignment equipment and wheel-balancing machines. <I>Brake repairers</I> adjust 
brakes, replace brake linings and pads, and make other repairs on brake systems. 
Some technicians specialize in both brake and front-end work. Even though electronics 
and electronic systems in automobiles were a specialty in the past, electronics 
are now so common that it is essential for all types of service technicians to 
be familiar with at least the basic principles of electronics. <BR> </FONT></P><TABLE CLASS=SectionHead WIDTH="100%"> 
<TBODY> <TR> <TH CLASS=ProgramHead ALIGN=left WIDTH="35%">Working Conditions</TH></TR> 
</TBODY> </TABLE><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nearly 
half of automotive service technicians work more than 40 hours a week. Some may 
also work evenings and weekends to satisfy customer service needs. Generally, 
service technicians work indoors in well-ventilated and -lighted repair shops. 
However, some shops are drafty and noisy. Although some problems can be fixed 
with simple computerized adjustments, technicians frequently work with dirty and 
greasy parts, and in awkward positions. They often lift heavy parts and tools. 
Minor cuts, burns, and bruises are common, but technicians can usually avoid serious 
accidents if the shop is kept clean and orderly, and safety practices are observed. 
<BR> </FONT></P><TABLE CLASS=SectionHead WIDTH="100%"> <TBODY> <TR> <TH CLASS=ProgramHead ALIGN=left WIDTH="35%">Training, 
Other Qualifications, and Advancement</TH></TR> </TBODY> </TABLE><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automotive 
technology is rapidly increasing in sophistication, and most training authorities 
strongly recommend that persons seeking automotive service technician and mechanic 
jobs complete a formal training program in high school, or in a postsecondary 
vocational school or community college. However, some service technicians still 
learn the trade solely by assisting and learning from experienced workers. Courses 
in automotive repair, electronics, physics, chemistry, English, computers, and 
mathematics provide a good educational background for a career as a service technician.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">High 
school programs, while an asset, vary greatly in scope. Some aim to equip graduates 
with enough skills to get a job as a technicians helper or trainee technician. 
Other programs offer only an introduction to automotive technology and service 
for the future consumer or hobbyist. Some of the more extensive programs participate 
in Automotive Youth Education Service (AYES), which has about 500 participating 
schools and more than 4000 participating dealers. Students who complete these 
programs receive an AYES certification and upon high school graduation are better 
prepared to enter entry-level technician positions, or to advance their technical 
education.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Postsecondary 
automotive technician training programs vary greatly in format, but normally provide 
intensive career preparation through a combination of classroom instruction and 
hands-on practice. Some trade and technical school programs provide concentrated 
training for 6 months to a year, depending on how many hours the student attends 
each week, and award a certificate. Community college programs normally award 
an associate degree or certificate and usually spread the training over 2 years 
by supplementing the automotive training with instruction in English, basic mathematics, 
computers, and other subjects. Some students earn repair certificates in one particular 
skill and opt to leave the program to begin their career before graduation. Recently, 
some programs have added to their curriculums training on employability skills 
such as customer service and stress management. Employers find that these skills 
help technicians handle the additional responsibilities of dealing with the customers 
and parts vendors.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
various automobile manufacturers and their participating dealers sponsor 2-year 
associate degree programs at postsecondary schools across the Nation. The Accrediting 
Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology (ACCSCT) currently certifies 
a number of automotive and diesel technology schools. Schools update their curriculums 
frequently to reflect changing technology and equipment. Students in these programs 
typically spend alternate 6- to 12-week periods attending classes full time and 
working full time in the service departments of sponsoring dealers. At these dealerships, 
students get practical experience while assigned to an experienced worker who 
provides hands-on instruction and timesaving tips.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
ASE certification is a nationally recognized standard for programs offered by 
high schools, postsecondary trade schools, technical institutes, and community 
colleges that train automobile service technicians. Some automotive manufacturers 
provide ASE-certified instruction programs with service equipment and current-model 
cars on which students practice new skills and learn the latest automotive technology. 
While ASE certification is voluntary, it does signify that the program meets uniform 
standards for instructional facilities, equipment, staff credentials, and curriculum. 
To ensure that programs keep up with ever-changing technology, repair techniques, 
and ASE standards, the certified programs are subjected to periodic compliance 
reviews and mandatory recertification, as are the ASE standards themselves. In 
2004, about 2000 high school and postsecondary automotive service technician training 
programs had been certified by ASE.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
trainee automotive service technician jobs, employers look for people with strong 
communication and analytical skills. Technicians need good reading, mathematics, 
and computer skills to study technical manuals and to keep abreast of new technology 
and learn new service and repair procedures and specifications. Trainees also 
must possess mechanical aptitude and knowledge of how automobiles work. Most employers 
regard the successful completion of a vocational training program in automotive 
service technology as the best preparation for trainee positions. Experience working 
on motor vehicles in the Armed Forces or as a hobby also is valuable. Because 
of the complexity of new vehicles, a growing number of employers require completion 
of high school and additional postsecondary training.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 
new cars have several onboard computers, operating everything from the engine 
to the radio. Engine controls and dashboard instruments were among the first components 
to use electronics, but today most automotive systems, such as braking, transmission, 
and steering systems, are controlled primarily by computers and electronic components. 
Some of the more advanced vehicles have global positioning systems, Internet access, 
and other high-tech features integrated into the functions of the vehicle. The 
training in electronics is vital because electrical components, or a series of 
related components, account for nearly all malfunctions in modern vehicles.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
addition to electronics and computers, automotive service technicians will have 
to learn and understand the science behind the alternate-fuel vehicles that have 
begun to enter the market. The fuel for these vehicles will come from the dehydrogenization 
of water, electric fuel cells, natural gas, solar power, and other non-petroleum-based 
sources. Hybrid vehicles, for example, use the energy from braking to recharge 
batteries that power an electric motor, which supplements a gasoline engine. As 
vehicles with these new technologies become more common, technicians will need 
additional training to learn the science and engineering that makes them possible. 
Currently, the manufacturers of these alternate-fuel vehicles are providing the 
necessary training. However, as the warrantees begin to expire, technicians in 
all industries will need to be trained to service these vehicles. As the number 
of these automobiles on the road increases, some technicians will likely specialize 
in the service and repair of these vehicles.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those 
new to automotive service usually start as trainee technicians, technicians helpers, 
or lubrication workers, and gradually acquire and practice their skills by working 
with experienced mechanics and technicians. With a few months experience, beginners 
perform many routine service tasks and make simple repairs. While some graduates 
of postsecondary automotive training programs are often able to earn promotion 
to the journey level after only a few months on the job, it typically takes 2 
to 5 years of experience to become a journey level service technician, who is 
expected to quickly perform the more difficult types of routine service and repairs. 
An additional 1 to 2 years of experience familiarizes technicians with all types 
of repairs. Complex specialties, such as transmission repair, require another 
year or two of training and experience. In contrast, brake specialists may learn 
their jobs in considerably less time because they do not need a complete knowledge 
of automotive repair.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
work, the most important possessions of technicians are their hand tools. Technicians 
usually provide their own tools, and many experienced workers have thousands of 
dollars invested in them. Employers typically furnish expensive power tools, engine 
analyzers, and other diagnostic equipment, but technicians accumulate hand tools 
with experience. Some formal training programs have alliances with tool manufacturers 
that help entry-level technicians accumulate tools during their training period.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Employers 
increasingly send experienced automotive service technicians to manufacturer training 
centers to learn to repair new models or to receive special training in the repair 
of components, such as electronic fuel injection or air-conditioners. Motor vehicle 
dealers and other automotive service providers also may send promising beginners 
to manufacturer-sponsored technician training programs; most employers periodically 
send experienced technicians to manufacturer-sponsored technician training programs 
for additional training to maintain or upgrade employees skills and thus increase 
the employees value to the employer. Factory representatives also visit many 
shops to conduct short training sessions.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Voluntary 
certification by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) 
has become a standard credential for automotive service technicians. Certification 
is available in 1 or more of 8 different areas of automotive service, such as 
electrical systems, engine repair, brake systems, suspension and steering, and 
heating and air-conditioning. For certification in each area, technicians must 
have at least 2 years of experience and pass the examination. Completion of an 
automotive training program in high school, vocational or trade school, or community 
or junior college may be substituted for 1 year of experience. For ASE certification 
as a master automobile technician, technicians must be certified in all eight 
areas. Technicians must retake each examination once every 5 years to maintain 
their certifications.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Experienced 
technicians who have leadership ability sometimes advance to shop supervisor or 
service manager. Those who work well with customers may become automotive repair 
service estimators. Some with sufficient funds open independent repair shops.

</FONT><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automotive service 
technicians and mechanics held about 803,000 jobs in 2004. The majority worked 
for automotive repair and maintenance shops, automobile dealers, and retailers 
and wholesalers of automotive parts, accessories, and supplies. Others found employment 
in gasoline stations; home and auto supply stores; automotive equipment rental 
and leasing companies; Federal, State, and local governments; and other organizations. 
More than 16 percent of service technicians were self-employed, more than twice 
the proportion for all installation, maintenance, and repair occupations.</FONT></P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><!-- /Employment Content -->

</FONT><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Job opportunities 
in this occupation are expected to be very good for persons who complete automotive 
training programs in high school, vocational and technical schools, or community 
colleges as employers report difficulty in finding workers with the right skills. 
Persons with good diagnostic and problem-solving abilities, and whose training 
includes basic electronics and computer courses, should have the best opportunities. 
For well-prepared people with a technical background, automotive service technician 
careers offer an excellent opportunity for good pay and the satisfaction of highly 
skilled work with vehicles incorporating the latest in advanced technology. However, 
persons without formal automotive training are likely to face competition for 
entry-level jobs.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Employment 
of automotive service technicians and mechanics is expected to increase as fast 
as the average through the year 2014. Over the 2004-14 period, demand for technicians 
will grow as the number of vehicles in operation increases, reflecting continued 
growth in the number of multi-car families. Growth in demand will be offset somewhat 
by slowing population growth and the continuing increase in the quality and durability 
of automobiles, which will require less frequent service. Additional job openings 
will be due to the need to replace a growing number of retiring technicians, who 
tend to be the most experienced workers.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most 
persons who enter the occupation can expect steady work, even through downturns 
in the economy. While car owners may postpone maintenance and repair on their 
vehicles when their budgets become strained, and employers of automotive technicians 
may cutback hiring new workers, changes in economic conditions generally have 
minor effects on the automotive service and repair business.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Employment 
growth will continue to be concentrated in automobile dealerships and independent 
automotive repair shops. Many new jobs also will be created in small retail operations 
that offer after-warranty repairs, such as oil changes, brake repair, air-conditioner 
service, and other minor repairs generally taking less than 4 hours to complete. 
Employment of automotive service technicians and mechanics in gasoline service 
stations will continue to decline, as fewer stations offer repair services. <BR>
