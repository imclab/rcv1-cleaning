<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial"> For better or for worse, we tend to believe
that the culture of &quot;wheels&quot; really arrived during the 20th century. Yet that's
not entirely true. Humanity has long had a fascination with a variety of forms of carts
and wagons. And throughout the ages people have honored wheeled transportation in a manner
that enhanced the intrigue surrounding independent travel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the extent that the culture surrounding
the automobile has blossomed in this century, nowhere can it be said that the car is more
central than in Southern California. Southern California has served as a springboard of
automotive symbolism and lifestyle integration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember the adage necessity is the mother
of invention? As an example, consider the fact that the world's first motel (motor-hotel)
popped up just north of Santa Barbara. When the recently-closed Motel Inn first opened its
doors in San Luis Obisbo on December 12, 1925, the &quot;101&quot; was just a narrow
two-lane highway. But you can bet that a place of lodging that allowed you to park your
car adacent to your room was a real hit with those weary motoring travelers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to California -- the spirit of the
pioneers, innovation, new trends, freedom of expression unlike any other region in the
world and the pervasive influence of ...cars.</font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font face="Arial">Capturing the Culture of Cars</font></h3>

<hr WIDTH="80%" align="center">

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While all of Southern California comprises
what many refer to as the car capital of the world, neighboring Los Angeles is truly the
mecca of wheels. And with more than 13 million cars on the streets of greater LA, what
better setting for an automotive museum? This was just one element in the vision of Robert
E. Petersen, after whom the largest automotive museum in the nation is named.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As chairman and founder of Petersen
Publishing Company (Motor Trend, Hot Rod, Car Craft), it was Petersen who, with his wife
Margie, provided the momentum for the project by donating $15 million to acquire a former
Ohrbach's department store and launch its renovation for an automotive museum. In June of
1994 the Petersen's witnessed their vision become reality. With the opening of the
Petersen Automotive Museum, Southern California now hosts one of the world's most unique
shrines for the world of wheels: more than 200 or the world's most valuable and historical
automobiles, racing cars, motorcycles, unusual vehicles, accessories, dream cars and cars
of the future.</font></p>

<hr WIDTH="80%" align="center">

<h3 align="center"><font face="Arial">$40 Million on the Miracle Mile</font></h3>

<hr WIDTH="80%" align="center">

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to intial impetus from the
Petersens, the $40 million entertainment and educational museum comes with strong
institutional credentials. The 300,000-square-foot facility is the newest addition to the
award-winning Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. And its location on the corner of
Wilshire Blvd. and Fairfax Ave. on the famed Miracle Mile section of Wilshire makes it
easy to access for tourists and local residents alike.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's most important about the Petersen
Automotive Museum is that it is so much more than what most people might expect at a
&quot;car museum.&quot; For that matter, it's noteworthy that non-car enthusiasts seem to
enjoy the musem as much as car buffs. This is because the museum takes in much more than
simply engines and sheet metal. The museum presents carefully executed themes that
surround the automobile. Among them is how people travel and the transportation decisions
that they make, social and geographic settlement patterns, how architecture and city
scapes have emerged around the automobile. There is also a repeating emphasis on the
recreational and fun aspects of motoring.</font></p>

<hr WIDTH="80%" align="center">

<h3 align="center"><font face="Arial">An Adventure in Four Stories</font></h3>

<hr WIDTH="80%" align="center">

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first floor of the four-story
building, visitors walk through time in &quot;Streetscape&quot; experiencing authentic
scenes, lifestyles and actual vehicles that marked the milestones of the automobile.
Southern California motoring lifestyle vignettes on the first floor include &quot;The Dog
Cafe,&quot; a roadside landmark of 1928; a &quot;Good Life&quot; 1920s bungalow style
house, complete with an early detached garage (one of the first architectural symbols
equated with the car), a 1932 L-shaped strip mall (another auto-tailored first in Southern
California) and even a replica of a drive-in restaurant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One particularly intriguing sight is the
facade of a Cadillac dealership that currently features a 1932 V8 Town Sedan, a 1932 V12
Victoria Coupe and even a V16 display engine -- taking you right back to how it was in
those glory days of yesteryear. You'll almost be expecting a salesperson to come out and
greet you with an era-like, &quot;Say folks, would you like to take one out for a test
drive? These sure are a swell model!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the way you can also go back in time
to see other rare models on display in the American Classics of 1930 to 1940 section.
Currently in this showcase there's a 1932 Duesenberg, a 1937 Cord 812 with a supercharged
V8 and a rare 1930 V16 Cadillac. Now, if that doesn't get you going, check this one out: a
1933 Franklin with the only air-cooled V12 ever produced! These will warm you up for what
you'll see more of at this year's fast approaching Santa Barbara Coucours D' Elegance --
where automobiles of the 30s will also be highlighted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How about show biz stuff? You can't think
about cars and Southern California without recognizing the Hollywood influence. The red
Corvette Stingray that Sam Malone drove in &quot;Cheers&quot; sits right before you -- and
you'll even see a tight squeeze (read accident) with Laurel and Hardy in an original 1922
Ford Model T Touring (from the 1930 movie &quot;Hog Wild&quot;). And if you're a
motorcycle fan, you'll marvel at seeing the last Harley-Davidson pinstriped by legendary
artist Von Dutch before he passed away.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second floor there are five galleries
showcasing the automobile as an object of art, design and technology. Among the rotating
displays is a time period focus that's currently aimed at the 1955 to 1960 period. Zowie!
Here you'll find a 1957 Ferrari Testa Rossa -- one of only a handful built and considered
one the most desirable of all Ferraris. From America, you can see the 1957 Corvette
featuring (hey, don't we all have this now?) &quot;fuel injection.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third floor features some of the world's
finest art galleries dedicated exclusively to the automobile. Displayed works include
photography by internationally recognized artist Jane Gottlieb and masterful collages by
Peter Tytla.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up on the fourth floor there is a handsome
glass penthouse conference center and the Founder's Lounge along with a full-service
catering kitchen to support special events and commericial gatherings.</font></p>

<hr WIDTH="80%" align="center">

<h3 align="center"><font face="Arial">When the Story's Told</font></h3>

<hr WIDTH="80%" align="center">

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you've spent a few hours -- or even all
day -- at the Petersen Automotive Museum, you can enjoy an automotive-theme meal at an
AM/PM restaurant next to the facility. Along with the truly spectacular visual adventure
that you'll experience when your tour the museum, having lunch or dinner at the AM/PM
restaurant will leave you half expecting James Dean to stroll in swinging his sunglasses
and his Porsche car keys. You can even imagine what he might have said ... &quot;Yeah, car
culture -- it's just California, ya' know what I'm saying?&quot; James Dean would have
been proud.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Petersen Automotive Museum, located at
6060 Wilshire Blvd. at Fairfax Ave., is open Tuesday through Sunday, 10:00 a.m. to 6:00
p.m. Phone ahead for current admission prices, but you can always know that junior car buffs 
(under 3 years old) are free!&nbsp; For more information call:
(213) 930-2277.</font></p>
