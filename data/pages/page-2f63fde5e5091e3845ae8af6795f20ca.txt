                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">You can make a piece of modern art by creating a paintball splatter effect with acrylic paints. When a paintball hits a surface, it creates a large blotch and splatter effect. You can re-create this effect for a piece of art by combining a few different splatter techniques. To make abstract art, you will create a graffiti effect that you can use as the main design or as the background in your art piece. Create bright colors and a variety of textures using a rainbow of paint colors and a few different techniques. Splatter painting is messy but enjoyable for&hellip;</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">In the art world, the term &#8220;genre&#8221; refers to paintings that depict everyday life in a naturalistic manner. Genre paintings became popular in the 17th century and often included aspects of peasant life, domestic activities, and common scenes in taverns and markets. In Germany, genre works flourished between 1815 and 1840, the period in which the &quot;Biedermeier&quot; style developed. This style, like genre painting, was closely associated with the new middle-class bourgeois culture that developed in Germany as a result of the growing urbanization and industrialization, and it can be seen the works of German painters and architects of the&hellip;</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Chinese parchment paper, also known as rice paper in English, has been used by artists for literally thousands of years. According to the website Asia-Art, this practice began at the end of the first century, when parchment was made from materials including pulp, fishnet and bark. Parchment paper today is typically machine made, although there are many artisans who craft their own paper. The art itself, whether landscape or figural, is traditionally meant to follow a Chinese tenet of beauty which, according to the website Chinatown Connection, defines the artist's goal as &#8220;painting in poetry, and poetry in painting.&quot;</p>

Portraiture began in ancient times with the depiction of deities and monarchs, and has changed throughout history with the movements and styles of the periods, such as classical portraiture in the Renaissance, modern era impressionism and abstract art to the photographic and graphic arts of today. There are four types of portraits seen throughout history in art, regardless of the subject, method or style that was used.</p>

The country is primarily known for its intricate carpet weaving and delicate pottery work, but Algerian artisans have a long tradition of excellence in other crafts as well, including wooden sculptures, basket making and jewelry design.

This stand will sit on a desktop or end table and hold up the artwork so that is plainly visible. The stand can accommodate a framed piece or an unframed piece. You will need to allow some drying time for your stand, so plan ahead and allow two days to make it, though it will take only about one hour of labor total.</p>

As technology has evolved, so has the technique for copying real paintings for a cheaper sale and more multiple sales of the same artwork. Prints sell for a fraction of the cost of a real oil painting, and can be produced on inexpensive paper or a more realistic canvas. Often, the printed canvas is painted over with a clear, glossy paint to simulate brush strokes, making it harder to rule it out as a print.

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">A line drawing is an outline drawing, not including color or shading. When inking line art, pen is used to enhance a plain line drawing. Inking gives depth and perception to an otherwise bland drawing. A drawing is usually inked over pencil, allowing the pencil to be erased later. It is best to use four different pen tip widths to ink line art. Using different widths, you will be able to emphasize lines to create shadow, darker outlines, and lighter inner lines. You can also create the look of a finished drawing without color or shading.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Etching and engraving are both methods of cutting lines into a hard surface, such as metal. The primary difference between them is that engraving is a physical process and etching is a chemical process. An engraver uses sharp tools to cut lines directly into a surface, while an etcher burns lines into a surface with acid.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">A picture hanging system is essentially a railing used to hang pictures that runs along a wall, or walls, of a room. Picture hangers are hooked over the rail and the pictures themselves hang from wires. Such a system allows you to rearrange pictures easily. Picture hanging systems are common in offices, but you can make one at home.</p>

Pastels come in various types, each with different characteristics, depending on the amount of binder that is added to the pigments. The advantage of using pastels is that they require minimal tools other than the pastels themselves and, if used correctly, create vibrant colors and rich textures on a piece of artwork.</p>

An artist may reproduce one of his paintings on a lithographic stone and make a print himself. The lithograph can be an exact copy of the painting, or it may be an interpretation or refinement of the original image. An artisan lithographer, skilled in the printing process, may copy and make prints of paintings by other artists.</p>

Washington, D.C. holds the National Cherry Blossom Festival each year to celebrate the beautiful trees and the amicable relationship between the U.S. and Japan. Delicate in appearance, cherry blossoms bloom in soft and bold shades of pink simultaneously, against the near-black background of the bark, creating a stark vision of beauty. Paint your own cherry blossoms for a lovely addition to your art collection or use your painting for invitations for a spring party or baby shower.</p>

This is usually done to enhance the artwork, making it more realistic and giving it an extra artistic flair. The lights are usually concentrated in one area of the painting and represent either a candle, the sun or another light source in the artwork itself. Lights are easily added to a canvas, because there is space behind it -- in the frame -- to support an insert. Add lighting to a painting, photograph or print for an exciting effect.

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Scanning artwork is a simple process, until you start getting into pieces of art that are larger than your scanner. Large pieces of art have to be scanned in quarters and then reassembled in a program like Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Paint. While taking a photo of your artwork is also an option, it will likely skew the image. If you want to turn your artwork into a digital file to be put onto a T-shirt, scanning is the best method. Before beginning, wipe the glass of your scanner with a wet cloth to avoid getting dust on your art.</p>

By using ink in the  airbrush, you avoid causing damage or rashes on skin and, unlike permanent tattoos, these are not painful as the process does not involve inserting the ink under the skin. Applying the ink is fairly easy, but inks with sparkles or shiny metals may require the use of a wider airbrush nozzle.</p>

Abstract art does not try to re-create a representative of the real world. If uses form, lines and different colors to represent the artist&#8217;s point of view on his chosen theme. It takes liberties with colors and images. Cave man drawings can be considered abstract, but the first modern abstracts started appearing in the art world in the late 1800s. The following century, Pablo Picasso and friends introduced the first subset of abstract art.</p>

They were primed and sealed with gesso made of animal glue and white clay or chalk. Sometimes a layer of linen or other finely woven cloth acted as a barrier between the wood and gesso. The gesso was applied in multiple layers and was often sculpted, incised or punched. Multicolored paint or gilding was applied over the gesso.

The painting your child made on the first day of school, for example, is invaluable even if nobody would buy it. Similarly, you may have a unique piece by an unknown artist that fits your quirky style perfectly but would have little monetary value to others. On the other hand, some pieces are quite valuable. Jackson Pollock's &quot;No. 5,&quot; for example, sold for $140 million. Chances are good that the piece you are wondering about falls somewhere in between.

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Ever since oil painting became popular, glazing has also been a much-used technique. Glazing seems much more simplistic than it actually is; in reality, glazing is a difficult, complex technique. Glazing involves laying a transparent layer of paint over dried opaque paint. Transparent paint doesn&#8217;t have to be clear; it can also be colored. The opaque paint is usually monochromatic, although you can also use the glazing technique with color. While this technique doesn&#8217;t physically mix the two different paints, it does make the overall painting appear different to the eye.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">A canvas painting can be mounted in ready-made, custom and floater picture frames. The main purpose of the frame, other than protection and support for the painting, is to enhance the artwork as much as possible. The choice of frame is subjective and should take the following considerations into account: Are you considering selling the painting? Is the painting to hang in your home, and what style benefits not only the painting but also the interior of your home? Does the painting require protection or would a floater frame suffice? What price you are willing to pay for the frame?</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Gesso is a white, pasty medium generally used for priming canvases. However, it's also used to sculpt shapes that will later be painted over. Ornate gold frames, for example, usually have gesso sculpture underneath all that gold leaf.  It's possible to make your own gesso from glue and an inert white pigment such as chalk or gypsum, and do-it-yourself gesso is just as effective as the store-bought kind. Because gesso does not lend itself well to three-dimensional sculpture, most people use some sort of backing, such as wood panel, to sculpt on.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Any painting must be deemed authentic by an auction house before it goes before the gavel. This often not an issue when your ownership can be traced, auction to auction, back to the original sale by the artist. Sometimes bargain hunters with an eye for art pick up paintings on a hunch, only to find that what they have bought for a few dollars is actually worth thousands, or even millions, of dollars. Learn what kind of work goes into authenticating those works before they may go to auction.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">You may feel pressure to get your new piece of art matted and framed immediately, but that's really not necessary. Unframed artwork can be displayed on walls and in homes in many ways, and most of those methods are cheaper than framing. Some art may even look better without the distraction of a frame. However, because your artwork won't have the additional protection a frame would provide, it's important to mount or display it in a way that won't damage the art, and it's important to protect the art from ultraviolet light.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Historically Venice residents from all ranks of society regularly wore masks, and the practice of masquerading was a year-round occurrence. Masks freed people from their inhibitions and allowed them a degree of anonymity in the small, crowded city. Laws eventually restricted the wearing of masks to certain times of the year. Today Venetian Carnival occurs during the months of February and March, and during this time residents and visitors to the Italian city regularly don masks and costumes as part of the celebration.</p>

As societies developed, so did the complexity and uses for ceramics. Humans invented new methods for increasing the artistry and functionality of their creations. Glazes are one result of this ceramics evolution. Used since ancient times, the properties of glaze make it both practical and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

But you can also make encaustic tiles using the encaustic painting technique over geometric pieces of wood or cement backer board. Encaustic painting is painting with hot colored wax. The different colored waxes are melted in separate containers and painted on in many layers to achieve a three-dimensional look. Tiles painted with wax cannot be used for regular tile installations, as they are sensitive to heat and wear. But they can be displayed&hellip;</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Madhubani painting is an ancient traditional folk art, which comes from the Mithila regi&#243;n of Bihar in India and parts of Terai in Nepal. Traditionally it is done by village women and ancient versions were usually painted on mud wall huts during a ceremony or important life event. But current artisans work on cloth, canvas, wood and hand-made paper. The paints used in Madhubani paintings are mineral- and earth-based, much as egg-tempera paints are, so this type of painting can withstand the elements without needing glass protection as other types of paint like watercolor require.</p>

Rather than celebrating material pleasures, the dramatic still life emphasizes the decay of earthly possessions; the dramatic still life artist portrays material fault and weakness. Pablo Picasso painted the dramatic still life through his 19th-century Cubist pieces.</p>

Due to their vibrant colors and longevity, oil paints work well for illustrations. In addition, they keep their color integrity through the process of reproduction. However, if you do not understand how to paint with oil, your illustrations can appear muddy and dull. By learning to use the right brush techniques, you can use oil paints to create illustrations that remain true to your original vision.</p>

The graffiti design is drawn, painted or printed onto the paper and then mounted to the wall or canvas using a gluten-based adhesive called wheat paste. Street artists Swoon, Shepard Fairey, WK Interact and JR are famed for their paste up artworks, all of which are mounted to walls using wheat paste. Wheat paste is an ideal adhesive for paste up graffiti because it's strong enough to hold up against harsh exterior elements, such as rain, wind and snow.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">A collage is a multi-media project that usually involves many images, often related, glued together in a way that is aesthetically attractive. Collages are often used as posters and decorative wall hangings. Children over 5 years old should be able to make a collage, but younger children will need the help of an adult.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Relining a painting involves attaching a new canvas backing to a deteriorating or damaged canvas, providing extra support. It&#8217;s an extremely delicate and risky process &#8212; and one that might ultimately damage or lower the value of the painting you&#8217;re trying to save. If possible, consult an expert in the restoration of antique paintings before deciding to reline your valuable work of art. Avoid tackling this project on your own unless you have training in art preservation and restoration.</p>

If an art piece is meant to cover an arched doorway or window, it needs to be in an arch shape to fit the space adequately. Such canvases &#8211; when professionally made &#8211; can be expensive to buy and you may even have to order them tailor-made, adding to the cost and potentially incurring a lengthy wait while the canvas is prepared.

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Monoprinting is a simple form of printmaking that produces one image per printing. Artists apply the ink to a flat printing plate and press the plate against a piece of paper using a printing machine. The process removes most of the ink from the plate, so the artist ends up with a unique image. Sometimes, artists can run the plate through a second time to get a &quot;ghost image&quot; with the ink left on the plate. When applying ink to the plate or the paper, artists use a variety of techniques.</p>

The practice endures and has been adopted by Western artists as well. The silk used for the painting must first be &quot;framed,&quot; which serves to stretch the material to allow it to receive paint.</p>

The technique was developed in Provincetown, Massachusetts at the beginning of the 20th century. For this reason, the white line technique is also known as the Princetown print, and is a &#8220;truly unique American art form&#8221; according to the International Fine Print Dealers Association.</p>

The prints have a distinctive look, with the grain of the wood becoming a part of the design. The supplies needed are inexpensive and easy to obtain, and the results can be stunning. A multiple-block woodcut requires one block for each of the colors to be printed. A three-color print makes a manageable but attractive first project.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Woodcutting is a traditional printmaking process dating back to the 15th century. To create a woodcut, an artist selectively carves a block of wood so that some areas are raised and others are recessed. When ink is spread across the surface of the wood and paper is pressed to its surface, only the raised areas will transfer ink. Using a favorite photo as reference, you can create your own woodcuts at home.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Inpainting existed long before computers. For centuries, some very talented people have made handsome livings working for museums restoring fine art. Inpainters working with fine art paint over lines, cracks and spots that come with age, accidents or damages from mishandling. Of course it takes a good eye and years of training to match colors and texture. Computers, however, have brought inpainting techniques to popular art forms like amateur photography. Using algorithms -- many of which were supplied by professional inpainters -- computers can remove spots and lines from any pictures.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Realism in art essentially refers to composition constructed as plainly and without interpretation as possible. The movement is generally noted to have originated from France around the 1850s. Artists sought to resist the more romantic notions represented in art and also to depict the realities of the Industrial Revolution that began during this time period. The Realism art movement continues to present day and offers depictions of highly detailed and carefully planned artwork.</p>

The more elaborate face paint designs may require the blending of colors or shading. Shading is easy to achieve if you work slowly and carefully.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">In fine art, masking is the process of using masking fluid to protect areas of your painting from paint. Often, this is done when the artist wants to preserve the white of the paper or canvas. These white areas of the paper or canvas will be highlights in the finished painting. Masking curved areas is just as easy as masking straight areas. All you need is a steady hand and a clear idea of where you want your white areas to be.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">To make artwork at home, dig down deep and seize the motivation, clear the decks and just do it. The perfect workspace, although it may be desirable, is unnecessary. There is a temptation to think that, when I get a studio, then I will make artwork. If a particular circumstance seems necessary to make some artwork, maybe then you will not get around to this project. It is more important to find the passion that motivates you to create artwork. With this approach, it is in the doing. Once a project is underway, this approach becomes easier. At the start,&hellip;</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Painting house portraits is a good way for a young artist to gain experience using business sense and artistic skills. You will make a little money, but the satisfaction will come from the look in the homeowner's eye as he sees it for the first time. Commissions are a big deal for artists. Most of your income will come from commissioned works. It is a bit different working on someone else's project instead of your own. You need a clear idea of what they want to avoid misunderstanding.

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">The Harlem Renaissance was a period during the 1920s and 1930s when African-American artists living in the Harlem region of New York City created a culture of unprecedented brilliance and creativity. Many of the artists and writers of the Harlem Renaissance were people who migrated to New York City in the early years of the 20th century, fleeing Jim Crow laws in the South. The concentration of African-American intellectuals and artists in Harlem was the driving force behind the expansion of art, writing, and political activism, and visual art experienced unprecedented growth during this time.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Molds for glass slumping are surprisingly easy to make. The key is to make the mold out of the right material which will withstand the 1,200 degree temperature in the kiln. This example explains how molds are made from clay. There are two basic types of molds in glass slumping. Hump molds are used to form the interior of the slumped glass. The glass sheet or piece is placed on top and slumps over it, it at the right temperature assuming the same shape. A slump mold, on the other hand, is bowl-shaped into which the glass melts.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Curtains can be used for a variety of resources. Typically, curtains are hung in homes and used to cover various windows. However, curtains can also be used on theater stages. Stage curtains are often thicker than regular, home-style curtains because they're used to conceal the stage from the audience in between stage acts and intermissions. Making stage curtains is a somewhat lengthy process, but the end result will be satisfying. Stage curtains provide theaters with style, color and security.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Knowing how to properly shade is a vital skill for any artist. Shading adds depth to objects, presenting them visually in the third dimension. Without varying shades of darkness, or value, an object will appear to be flat. Learning to shade requires experimentation with different techniques. The first attempts are unlikely to be realistic, but new skills will develop through consistent practice.</p>

Nevertheless, Roman art, predominately created on fresco plaster wall murals, has an interesting history. It is divided into four periods with four distinct styles.</p>

Throughout art's history, inspiring pieces of art have been created from any number of themes and ideas, such as spirituality, personal or political struggle to name a few. Since art affects each person in a unique way, there is no telling what themes or artistic techniques will serve to inspire any one viewer. An artist who is truly inspired will be more likely to commit that same feeling to whatever they are creating.</p>

Airbrush painting is no different, especially if the theme of the piece is a distressed one. Rips and wrinkles in something was once a distasteful view to many, but when they are presented in an artistic form, they are viewed as valued detail. For example, rips and tears in jeans may be viewed on the street as an everyday, normal thing, but on an airbrushed design it looks like a detailed piece of art.</p>

Through the centuries, as art has evolved, so, too, has the definition of aesthetics, as it relates to art. The enormity and complexity of the field of art and the individuality of opinions makes defining aesthetics the subject of much debate. However, cultures and time periods are commonly used to categorize aesthetics as they relate to art of varying periods, countries and people.

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Gothic mural painting -- also called fresco painting -- of the 12th century through the middle of the 15th century served as a creative bridge between the primitive art of the Dark Ages and the highly realistic art of the Renaissance. At first, Gothic mural painters followed in the simplistic and unrealistic styles of previous artwork. However, when Giotto introduced realistic elements into his frescoes, he started a whole new approach to the art of painting.</p>

His flat renditions of the French Mediterranean landscape broke from Renaissance ideas of perspective and influenced a whole new generation of painters, most prominently Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. These avant-garde artists became famous for their abstracted forms of musical instruments, especially the guitar and violin.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">During the second half of the 18th century, artists throughout Europe embraced Romanticism, a cultural movement that rejected the Age of Enlightenment's emphasis on reason, logic and science. Romantic artists believed emotion and imagination were the basis of higher forms of expression. Painters abandoned the 18th century neo-classicist style with its balanced compositions, idealized forms and restrained colors. They developed a new visual language with bold brush strokes, pure color and asymmetrical designs. Romantic painters turned to nature, everyday life and folklore for subjects that displayed and evoked emotion.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Cardboard tubes provide a convenient way to mail or store art, but the damage to the paper can be frustrating to resolve. The rolled paper expands inside the tube, which makes it difficult to remove. Once the art is taken from the tube, the curled paper needs to be flattened. The solution is as simple as placing heavy books on top of the paper. Art should be stored flat to avoid permanent damage to the paper.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Intaglio printmaking techniques include etching, drypoint, aquatint and mezzotint, among others. The term "intaglio" derives from the Italian verb "intagliare," which means to carve or engrave. Generally speaking, intaglio techniques have one process in common: printing an image from an inked plate on which a design has been incised into the surface. It is the method of creating the design (whether it's a drawing or some other graphic image) that differs with each technique.</p>

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Mosaic is the art of creating pictures with tiny pieces of colored glass, rocks or similar materials. While it is widely employed as a means of decoration, much mosaic art throughout history has a religious significance. Throughout the history of Christianity, mosaics have been used as a means of decorating cathedrals and telling Biblical stories to Christians who were not able to read the Bible. Most of the famous historical mosaics come from Italy, though examples can also be found in other parts of Europe.</p>

Dictionary.com provides two definitions that form the constituents of what you, the audience, deem to be "effective": the object of art (such as paintings, sculptures or photos), and its extraordinary expression. Put simply, effective art meets the goals of its creator and its intended effect on an audience.</p>

Sacrilegious to some, sacrosanct to others, his works in various periods of his career made an indelible impact on the art consumer as well as other artists. He remains modern and contemporary, in large part because his social affairs made an impact on the world as well as his artistic output. His legacy can be honored and appreciated in many ways.</p>

Baroque art captured the emotions of its subjects while portraying them as if in motion, making it extremely realistic. The people in Velazquez's paintings seem as if they are true living and breathing entities. His style was unique but it was influenced by at least four themes in his life.</p>

The best works by the most well known artists such as Pablo Picasso and Vincent Van Gogh sometimes command prices of hundreds of millions of dollars. As watchers of "Antiques Roadshow" and "Pawn Stars" know, there are valuable pieces of art available at estate and yard sales at modest prices. With a little research, you can learn how to determine if your artwork is valuable or worth very little.</p>

Arches are curved to span a space and bear weight in a building or structure, and are commonly carved from stone or contructed with multiple stones that are fitted together with the help of stone-shaping tools. Many arches are works of art in themselves, as their shape and embellishments can tell the story of a building's construction or yield clues into the dominant artistic philosophy of an ancient culture.

                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Realism and naturalism are both largely 19th century artistic movements, although Naturalism's roots stretched back several centuries. Emerging around mid-century in France, they later spread through Europe and America. Realism and naturalism were responses to romanticism, and its concentration on the portrayal of emotions. Realism and naturalism, by contrast, aimed to portray realistic, accurate views of life and landscapes. While the two movements had similar values, there are some key differences in their approach.</p>

Meaning essentially the same thing, esthetics and aesthetics refer to things related to beauty and taste. Many artists subscribe to a particular esthetic standard that guides their technique and defines their work. Esthetic philosophies have a long history, extending at least as far back as the ancient Greeks with their strong ideals of beauty.</p>

He was interested in the arts at an early age and when he was 21, enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He is considered one of the founders of the Impressionist movement, although his classical education heavily influenced his work. His art is noted for its innovative use of pastels and its subject matter, which was often of theatrical or "low-life" subjects. He excelled at painting, drawing, sculpting and was also interested in photography.</p>

Painters had learned how to make figures in their pieces appear more realistic through the use of perspective and shading. They often depicted their subjects against natural backgrounds. While sometimes demonstrating the influences of other artists, the Renaissance master painters developed their own signature painting techniques.</p>

When stretching your own canvas on artist stretcher bars, you can staple the fabric to the back of the frame to hide the staples from sight. However, if you are working with a canvas with staples down the side edges, there are ways to cover unsightly staples. Conceal the staples so they are not visible, or add a decorative, textural element that coordinates with your multi-media piece of art or decorative painting while concealing the staples.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Spanish artist Francisco Goya (1746-1828) created etchings using the intaglio aquatint process. Significant aquatint works created by Goya include: Los Caprichos, Estan calientes and a series of 82 prints titled Los Desastres De La Guerra, or The Disasters of War. The aquatint process utilizes a copper plate infused with an acid resistant substance, such as finely ground rosin. Fine particles on the surface of the plate result in a delicate stippling with tonal qualities that are similar in appearance to a wash. The aquatint process allows tonal variations that were previously accomplished by illusion using layers of fine etched lines.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Biographies of Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, commonly referred to simply as "Michelangelo," speak of a rivalry with fellow Renaissance artist Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci. While the two were active in the art world at the same time, da Vinci was an established artist of the previous generation before Michelangelo gained notice. The one-sided rivalry stemmed from the influence of da Vinci on Michelangelo's work, and the jealousy it caused is apparent from the similarities between the two artists.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Etching is a printing technique dating back to the 16th century with the first dated print created by Urs Graf in 1513. The technique is still in use today, but artists are replacing the toxic acids with more environmentally friendly solutions. The etching technique involves several stages, each playing an equally important role in the success of the printing.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p class="Grid6 Omega excerpt">Differences between texture and pattern can be described in different ways through different mediums in the art world. In our everyday lives, texture would refer to the sense of touch while pattern is more a visual recognition of a series of lines and curves in a design that repeat themselves. In visual art, texture is seen through shading techniques in a drawing or painting that visually represents how something would feel if you could put your hand on it.</p>
