		<div id="page_h2title">Herta Soman learned about curbstoning the
		hard way when she fell for a curbstoner's story and wound up paying
		$15,000 for a '97 Honda only to find out the warranties were void
		because the vehicle had been totaled nearly three (3) years earlier.<br>

		<br>
		"I was angry-I was in shock," said Soman after discovering through
		CARFAX that the car she purchased from a private seller had once been
		salvaged. "I was speechless-I feel like I'm driving a fraud."<br>
		<br>
		Sadly, Soman is not alone. Law enforcement officials estimate that
		many of the cars advertised in classified ads or sold at the curb may
		be curbstoned, salvage cars for sale-vehicles sold by scam artists who pose as
		private sellers. These curbstoners often sell vehicles reputable
		dealers won't touch because of hidden problems, such as those with a salvaged car
		title, that can affect both safety and value. <br>
		<br>
		"Unfortunately, dishonesty sometimes is very profitable," laments John
		Creel, Consumer Investigator. Creel has been busting curbstoners for
		years. He explains how this scam works. Curbstoners pick up bad
		cars-"cars that may have spun odometers or salvage cars" for
		example-from junkyards or wholesale auctions, then pass them off to
		unsuspecting consumers as quality family cars. <br>
		<br>

		"You don't tell him you got it a week ago, and you cleaned it up and
		now you're selling it," reveals a former curbstoner caught by Creel
		who requested anonymity. "It's possible even to hide the fact that a
		car has been totaled by registering it or changing the title in
		another state," he adds. <br>

		<div id="page_h2title">Consumer safety advocates say you can't
		be too careful when buying a used car today since rebuilt wrecks are
		more likely to fail in the event of another crash. It is especially
		dangerous when the driver has no idea the vehicle has been in a major
		accident before.<br>

		<br>
		"Your chances of being in a serious auto crash in your lifetime are 1
		out of 2," says Jackie Gillan of Advocates for Highway and Auto
		Safety. "Those are very high odds, so you want to make sure when
		you're buying a used car that it's not only going to provide the
		transportation you need, but is also going to provide you and your
		family with a safe driving environment." <br>
		<br>

		Creel always recommends that consumers do their homework before buying
		any pre-owned vehicle-especially from a private seller. "The first
		thing you want to do is get a CARFAX report," he says. <br>
		<br>
		Herta Soman, who-because of a curbstoner-got stuck with a now failing
		rebuilt wreck echoes Creel's sentiment. "I wish I would have done that
		prior to purchasing my car-it would have saved me a lot of grief, and
		a lot of money." <br>
		<h2>What Is Curbstoning?</h2>

				<td align="center"><img id="CurbstoningGif" src="/img/car_buying/curbstoning1.gif" alt="CARFAX - Curbstoning...Facts & Tips To Avoid Being Taken" width="200" height="121" border="0"><br>

		Curbstoners are scam artists. State laws prohibit private citizens
		from selling multiple cars or vehicles other than those titled to
		them. Curbstoning involves individuals who ignore these laws meant to
		protect consumers from unlicensed, unscrupulous sellers. Frequently,
		they sell vehicles reputable dealers won't touch-those with hidden
		problems in their pasts-problems that can affect both the safety and
		the value of these vehicles.<br>
		<br>

		All too often a consumer goes to a curbstoner thinking that they will
		get a better deal. They may feel less intimidated approaching an
		individual seller they perceive to be a neighbor versus a professional
		salesman. They may think they can't afford a vehicle from a reputable,
		reliable dealer. Unfortunately, whatever the reason for going to a
		private seller, shoppers who buy from them without checking the
		vehicle's history can end up paying too much money for a poorly
		rebuilt wreck, a lemon or may be even stolen vehicle.<br>
		<br>
		Victims of curbstoners often end up making expensive repairs because a
		rolled back odometer led them to believe the vehicle was in better
		shape. Or, they may find themselves in a dangerous vehicle that has
		already been totaled due to a severe accident.<br>
		<br>
		According to Larry Gamache, Director of Communications for CARFAX,
		"Law enforcement officials agree that many of the cars advertised in
		classified ads may be curbstoned vehicles. Curbstoning is nothing new,
		but it is now reaching epidemic proportions, which is bad news for
		consumers and dealers, alike. Curbstoners weave elaborate, seemingly
		sincere, stories to gain a buyer's confidence or pity. Usually they're
		variations on the same stories, such as: a relative passed-away, they
		are sending a child off to college, a friend or relative has asked
		them to sell it for them, they are getting married, moving or getting
		a company car, etc. By recognizing these 'tall tales,' consumers can
		know to say 'no.'"

		<h2>Guarding Against Curbstoners</h2>
		Buy from a reputable dealer -- More than 25,000 dealers nationwide
		subscribe to CARFAX to ensure that the vehicles they sell on their
		lots are safe and reliable. Through CARFAX, consumers can find a
		dealer and even find a car locally that meets their needs. Most CARFAX
		dealer subscribers even offer free copies of the Vehicle History
		Reports to their customers-all you need to do is ask.<br>

		<br>
		But, if you still want to buy from an individual, there are ways to
		guard against curbstoners:
		<ul>
			<li>Ask to see the driver's license of the seller along with the
			car's title. If the name on the title doesn't match the name on the
			license, don't buy it.<br>
			<br>
			</li>
			<li>Ask the seller for a detailed <a id="purchaseLink" href="https://secure.carfax.com/creditCard.cfx?partner=CSS_7">
			CARFAX Vehicle History Report</a>
			to identify if the car has a salvage history, odometer fraud or flood
			damage. It will also show recent, frequent or excessive title
			transfers that may contradict the seller's story.<br>
			<br>

			</li>
			<li>Take the car to a trusted mechanic. A professional
			inspection can uncover weld marks, water spots and uneven tire treads
			- all clues to a potentially unsafe vehicle.<br>
			<br>
			</li>
			<li>Check the phone number. See if the same phone number appears
			in multiple ads, and make sure that you have a way to get back in
			touch with the car seller-not just a cell phone or pager number.
			Curbstoners often use them to change their locations without being
			caught.<br>
			<br>
			</li>
			<li>Always be a little leery if the price that seems just too
			good to be true. If something feels wrong, walk away.</li>

		</ul>
		<h2>What Local Dealers Can Do To Curb Curbstoning</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Be informed - Knowing what curbstoning is and where
			curbstoners work in your area can help you combat them by educating
			consumers of this illegal practice, its risks and consequences. <br>
			<br>
			</li>
			<li>Check the classified ads - Learn what cars are most popular
			and in demand. Plan to increase the visibility of similar cars on
			your lot to make curbstoning less desirable in your community. <br>

			<br>
			</li>
			<li id="carfaxDealerBullet">Use CARFAX - If you aren't already, become a CARFAX
			Subscribing Dealer. It helps you keep undesirable vehicles out of
			your inventory and demonstrates to buyers that your cars are top
			notch.<br>
			<br>
			</li>
			<li>Advertise - It seems simple, but a lot of dealerships are
			timid about placing ads. Advertising is a great way to reach
			consumers.<br>
			<br>
			</li>

			<li>Participate - Getting involved in your local community lets
			consumers in your area get to know you, and builds a positive
			reputation for you and your business. Donations of cars to charity,
			volunteering at events and speaking to newspapers are all great ways
			to get involved and show your pride in the community.<br>
			<br>
			</li>
			<li>Contact authorities - Finally, if you suspect there's a
			curbstoner in your area, contact the local authorities and encourage
			them to take action to protect consumers. These unlicensed sellers
			are breaking the law, plain and simple.</li>
