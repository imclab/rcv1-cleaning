              <td height="277"> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Roaring Twenties was alternatively 
                  known as The Jazz Age. This "movement" in which jazz music grew 
                  in popularity by immense standards in the U.S., also influenced 
                  other parts of the world. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Following World War I, around 500,000 
                  African Americans in search of better employment opportunities 
                  moved to the northern part of the United States. With them, 
                  they brought their culture and in New York, the start of the 
                  Harlem Renaissance. During this period of time, the works of 
                  African Americans in fields such as writing and music escalated. 
                  Styles of music including Dixieland and blues became popular 
                  as well. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Charleston, a lively dance 
                  with origins in South Carolina and African American styles, 
                  became immensely popular. The dance, which can be done solo, 
                  with two, or in a group, received attention after being shown 
                  in <i>Runnin' Wild</i>, a 1923 musical. One man, John Giola, 
                  from New York managed to do the Charleston for 22 hours and 
                  30 minutes! This particular dance was introduced to Europeans 
                  in 1925. Other dances of the era included the Cake-Walk, the 
                  Turkey Trot, the Black Bottom, and the Bunny Hug. With the increased 
                  popularity of dances, events such as dance marathons were also 
                  created. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Throughout the 1920's many people 
                  took an interest in music. They owned pianos, played sheet music, 
                  and listened to records. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One name, arguably one of the most 
                  famous jazz musicians of all time, is worth mentioning. Louis 
                  Daniel Armstrong (1901 - 1971), from New Orleans, Louisiana, 
                  displayed his amazing talents as a trumpeter, cornet player, 
                  and singer during the Jazz Age. He studied and played with a 
                  famed cornet player named Joseph "King Oliver" Oliver (1885 
                  - 1938). Afterwards, he became a member of Fletcher Henderson's 
                  group. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1925, "Satchmo," who had learned 
                  to play cornet at the age of twelve, started The Hot Fives. 
                  The band would later gain two more musicians and was appropriately 
                  renamed The Hot Sevens. His wife, Lil, was also a member of 
                  the group and played the piano. The following year, Armstrong 
                  recorded "Heebie Jeebies". "Pops" did not restrict his talents 
                  to just music, however. He also starred in films such as <i>Pennies 
                  from Heaven</i>. He continued working in the last three years 
                  of his life, most of which was spent in hospitals. He died at 
                  home on July 6, 1971. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some of the many great artists 
                  of that time also included Duke Ellington (1899 - 1974), Joseph 
                  "King Oliver" Oliver (1885 - 1938), Bessie Smith (1894? - 1937), 
                  Benny Goodman (1909 - 1986), and Ma Rainey. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In July of 1925, Adolf Hitler (1889 
                  - 1945) issued his autobiography. The book, entitled <i>Mein Kampf</i> 
                  or <i>My Struggle</i>, would have a second volume in 1926; the People's 
                  Edition appeared in 1930. The book, written while Hitler was 
                  imprisoned early in his career, reflected his hatred of Jews, 
                  and his belief that Germans were a superior race. Outside of 
                  Germany the book was not given much notice, a fact the Allies 
                  would soon regret.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Adolf Hitler was born on April 
                  20, 1889, in Austria. He served time in Germany's armed forces 
                  during World War I as a political spy and became a decorated 
                  corporal. He served as leader of the German Workers' Party, 
                  which would later be renamed the National Socialist German Workers' 
                  (Nazi) Party. In 1933, he came to power as chancellor of the 
                  Third Reich. Despite Hitler's doing away with democracy, the 
                  people of Germany applauded his efforts, for they were weary 
                  of the depressed state of affairs that followed Germany's defeat 
                  in World War I. After involving his country in a costly second 
                  world war, geared to make it the predominant world power, Adolf 
                  Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945. </font></p>

                in 1925. His first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i> had been 
                made available to the public in 1920. His writings often portrayed 
                people who became successful in the social and financial worlds, 
                but did not share the same prosperity in their morals. As a perfect

                  Prior to this work, A. A. Milne had also written plays and novels 
                  such as Mr. Pim Passes By and The Red House Mystery. For children 
                  he created When We Were Very Young in 1924. This was the book 
                  in which Winnie-the-Pooh (then Our Teddy Bear or Edward Bear) 
                  first appeared. Milne also featured his young son, Christopher 
                  Robin, Winnie-the-Pooh, and their friends in other works: Now 
                  We Are Six and The House at Pooh Corner. All of Milne's work 
                  for children has been considered classic. His characters are 
                  still widely popular to this day and have been portrayed in 
                  many forms such as movies and toys. </font></p>
