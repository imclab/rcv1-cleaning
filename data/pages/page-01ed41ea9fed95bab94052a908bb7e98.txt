<p>Just like typical male chauvinist, Actor Cesar Montano is still bitter about the split with his wife Sunshine Cruz. He posted on his instagram where he mentioned that his soon to be ex-wife is now dating somebody else. Apparently, the split wouldn&#8217;t have started if he had zipped up his pants. Any sane women will dump their husband&#8217;s cheating ass. It&#8217;s no longer the dark ages where women have to put up with their husband&#8217;s cheating ways.</p>

<p>Congressman Benjo Benaldo shoots himself and was found bleeding in his office. Whatever his motives were, it&#8217;s probably to gain sympathy from his estranged wife Daiana Menezes. Not only was he physically abusive towards her, he probably has no money to burn after losing the election. Next time dude, shoot yourself on the head and save us taxpayers from footing your hospital bills. Oh and good luck with your soon to be ex-wife.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cagayan de Oro first district Rep. Benjo Benaldo was rushed to the hospital after he was found bleeding from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound at the South Lobby of the Batasan Pambansa early Thursday evening, officials said.</em></p>
<p><em>In an interview with Jessica Soho on GMA&#8217;s State of the Nation news program, House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. said the 43-year-old Benaldo was alone in his room before he was found bleeding in the lobby.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Apparently, nag-iisa lang siya sa room at the time it happened. He probably shot himself in the chest,&#8221; Belmonte said.</em></p>
<p><em>Marcelo Castro of the House Media Bureau, who saw Benaldo drenched in blood at the lobby, told GMA News Online that the wounded congressman was immediately brought to New Era Hospital along Commonwealth Avenue.</em></p>
<p><em>As of posting time, Belmonte said Benaldo&#8217;s condition was &#8220;progressing&#8221; at the hospital.<br />
&#8220;Nakakapag-thumbs up pa nga siya at nakatawa,&#8221; the Speaker said.<br /></em> </p>

<p>Yeng Constantino posted on her instagram with a photo of a mystery guy and her. The guy turned out to be Yan Asunscion of Indios. Included in her post are sugar inducing thanks to her snookums. It&#8217;s good that she finally found the guy for her. I doubt though if their relationship would last but oh well at least she&#8217;s happy for now.</p>

					<p>I almost choked when I read on this article of PEP of which Enchong Dee confessed in an interview that he and Julia Montes broke up last October 2012. I ain&#8217;t buying this bullcrap, no sireeee&#8230;I though they made an afreement not to let the public know about but obviously his big mouth had to talk. Probably to dispel the gay rumors about him. Ok sweetheart we understand you, in the meantime lay off the lip glass please.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bagamat hindi nila inamin sa publiko, marami ang nakakaalam na naging sila talaga at nag-break noong October 2012. Sabi ng Kapamilya young actor, “We talked about&#8230; we agreed na wala kaming ilalabas. “Then, after the workshop, naging maayos na. “Honest kami sa isa’t isa at yung tiwala namin sa isa’t isa, sabi namin ay muli naming ibabalik. “At saka kung sasabihin man ng tao na, ‘Grabe naman, timing naman. Porke’t may gagawing teleserye…’</p>

					<p>Louella Yap Chiu, the mother of actress Kim Chiu, passed away last June 23 at the age 50 at Cebu Hospital. The illness wasn&#8217;t disclosed by the family for privacy purposes. Despite the controversies that Kim Chiu went through, she remained firm for the sake of her family. I hope she gets through this difficult time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MANILA – The mother of Kapamilya actress Kim Chiu passed away on Sunday. She was 50. According to information gathered by ABS-CBN News, Louella Yap Chiu had been confined at a Cebu hospital due to an illness. The family has refused to disclose more information.</p>
<p>The news team has yet to determine when Mrs. Chiu was admitted to the hospital. As of writing, the family of the actress refused to grant any media interviews. Chiu is asking the public to respect their family’s privacy as they mourn the loss of their mother.</p>
<p>Heartfelt condolences</p>
<p>Meanwhile, supporters of Chiu took to the social networking site Twitter to express their deepest condolences to the actress’ family. Most of them told the actress to just stay strong amid this ordeal for there is a reason why things happen. Others, meantime, reminded the actress that they will pray for her in this trying time.</p>

<p>James Yap certainly moved on to much hotter rumored italian girlfriend named Michelle Acazzola. While nothing&#8217;s confirmed yet on his camp, that certainly ain&#8217;t stopping people from blabbering.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that got Queen of Blab Kris Aquino (James Yap&#8217;s infamous ex) probably foaming in the mouth with anger.  </p>

<p>I have no idea who this doctor Yas Muralla was nor was I even aware of the show &#8220;Doctors on TV&#8221;. But there&#8217;s this nude photos of her that&#8217;s making rounds on Facebook. I&#8217;m not so sure if this was indeed her in the photo since I don&#8217;t see any news verifying this report. Oh well&#8230;</p>
<p>I suspect either her husband or the wife of this certain Architect Signo has gotten hold of this saucy photos of her. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s with these people who are snapping intimate photos of themselves.</p>

<p>I could not help but feel dismayed when I saw this article on yahoo. While this amateur filmmaker has this noble intention but I couldn&#8217;t understand why he choose to remake a Japanese classic movie. I&#8217;m sorry but this whole limited resources is not an excuse if he has limited access to filipino classics. There&#8217;s many of it available online and posted on youtube.</p>
<p>Can I say typical colonial mentally? I see this as a grandiose attempt to ride coattails on this Oscar winning foreign fiilm. So how are they going to remake it? Will they convert the samurai into fisherman, carpenter or whatever? Or will they just dress up the local actor as samurai? </p>
<p>The country has so many struggling original filmmakers yet Martha Atienza, Lav Diaz and etc choose to support this guy. Unbelieveable how they tolerate in encouraging aspiring filmmakers to be unoriginal. It&#8217;s gonna inspire new waves of struggling filmmakers to remake foreign classics. We&#8217;ll probably be seeing remakes of Ingmar Bergman&#8217;s Seventh Seal, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cloyd Ribo, a middle-aged struggling local filmmaker from a remote island in southern Philippines, dreams of remaking Akira Kurosawa&#8217;s award-winning film &#8220;Rashomon&#8221; in his native dialect (Lawisanon).<br />
With the help of trusted artist-friends, Ribo is in the process of making this film project a reality on Bantayan Island in Cebu.</p>
<p>Asked why he chose to remake &#8220;Rashomon,&#8221; Ribo explained: &#8220;It&#8217;s a narrative that revealed so much about humanity.&#8221; &#8220;Rashomon&#8221; is a Japanese crime drama film that won the Golden Lion Award for its director (Akira Kurosawa) in the 1951 Venice Film Festival, and Best Foreign Language Film in the 24th Academy Wards in the US in 1952.<br />
Ribo is a self-taught filmmaker, who has been studying the craft from online sources, mostly from Youtube, since 2010.</p>
<p>His barbecue-cum-internet shop has been the venue of his online learning. From there, he has learned the ropes of film making, including how to use the camera, editing, and graphic ad via the internet.</p>
<p>Under Project Cloyd initiated by the Office of Culture and Design (OCD), a group of Filipino directors from the Philippine independent cinema community and Spanish directors has been helping Ribo&#8217;s group realize this project.  The lineup of directors and creative professionals include Lav  Diaz, Yason Banal, Martha Atienza, Franco Guerrero, Joey Suaco, Raya Martin, Spanish director Carlos Casas and graphic artist Rafa Cortez.</p>

<p>Senator Tito Sotto&#8217;s &#8220;Maalaala mo kaya&#8221; worthy performance on &#8220;Turno en Contra&#8221; on the Reproductive Health is plagued with issue such as plagiarism. Obviously, since he got some lazy staff to write the speech for him, this leaves him no choice to assume responsibility for it. Instead of apologizing for this embarrassing lapse, he vehemently denied it the way seasoned politicians do. I wonder if that staff will be expecting some Christmas bonus this year?</p>
<p>Anyway, all this hoopla got the attention of the blogger Sarah who originaly wrote the article. Apparently, she wasn&#8217;t amused. <a href="http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/on-plagiarism-the-pill-and-presumptuousness/" target="_blank"><strong>Read about it here</strong></a>. You guys can stop apologizing on behalf of our idiotic senator, she seems cool about it. The good thing about it is that it got the attention on the serious side effects the pill might cause in the long run. The fight for RH Bill still continues and hope that it will indeed gets passed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Below is a comparison of Sotto&#8217;s speech and Sarah&#8217;s blog:</em></p>
<p><em>Sotto&#8217;s speech:<br />
&#8220;According, to Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride MD, the use of the pill also causes severe gut dysbiosis. What is worse, drug induced gut imbalance is especially intractable and resistant to treatment either with probiotics or diet change.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Sarah&#8217;s blog:<br />
&#8220;According, to Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride MD, use of other drugs such as the Pill also cause severe gut dybiosis. What&#8217;s worse, drug induced gut imbalance is especially intractable and resistant to treatment either with probiotics or diet change.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Sotto&#8217;s speech:<br />
&#8220;Gut imbalance brought on through use of the pill negatively impacts the ability to digest food and absorb nutrients. As a result, even if a woman eats spectacularly well during pregnancy, if she has been taking oral contraceptives for a period of time beforehand, it is highly likely that she and her baby are not reaping the full benefits of all this healthy food as the lack of beneficial flora in her gut preclude this from occurring.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>Sotto&#8217;s speech:<br />
&#8220;Pathogenic, opportunistic flora that take hold in the gut when the pill is used constantly produce toxic substances which are the by-products of their metabolism. These toxins leak into the woman’s bloodstream and they have the potential to cross the placenta. Therefore, gut dysbiosis exposes the fetus to toxin.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>Sotto&#8217;s speech:<br />
&#8220;Not well known is also the fact that use of the pill depletes zinc in the body. Zinc is called &#8216;the intelligence mineral&#8217; as it is intimately involved in mental development.&#8221;</em></p>
