            <p>Every year since 1948 the first full weekend in June brings tens of thousands of art enthusiasts to the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, adjacent to the University of Chicago campus, for the 57th Street Art Fair. Artists from throughout the country gather to exhibit their original work in a unique outdoor setting and give collectors a chance to buy their wares. Although most exhibitors are returning artists, each year the Fair invites participation by a limited number of new artists whose work has been screened by a jury of art professionals.<br />
<br />
Artists new to the Fair are asked to complete an application to submit your work for consideration. Returning artists must submit a completed application to reserve a booth space.<br />
<br />
We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

            <p>We invite all artists to apply. The Affordable Arts Festival has a unique and appealing format for art buyers since all of the art in the show is priced at $100 or less. This concept has been modeled after two very successful events that have been around for many years. One is a national show and the other is international. The art buying excitement created by these festivals is unlike any other arts festival. The Affordable Arts Festival will be held on August 25, 2013 on the beautiful campus of the Arapahoe Community College (easy set-up and tear down). With extensive promotions and advertising, we expect large crowds in our inaugural year. The festival will host a maximum of 150 artists in 2013. For more info about how this unique event is beneficial to both the artists and the buying public please go to our website&rsquo;s FAQ&rsquo;s at http://www.affordableartsfestival.com/festivalfaq.html</p>

            <p>The third annual Amagansett Fine Arts Festival will be held on the grounds of the Amagansett American Legion, strategically located in the picturesque and affluent area known as The Hamptons. The July 4th weekend is historically the busiest time of the year for the summer homes and beach retreats, and a follow up to the one of the first truly high-quality fine art events of The Hamptons will continue to build upon this legacy. This event is quickly developing a reputation of being a great example of an artist-run show, with the festival website showcasing all of the participating artists with images, short descriptions and links to each artist&#39;s own website. As July 4th falls on a Thursday in 2013, the following three day festival weekend is sure to have excellent attendance and great sales potential.</p>

The 37th Annual American Crafts Festival takes place at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, one of the most prestigious arts centers in the world. That association has always connoted the highest level of craftsmanship which attracts, year after year, a very large, astute, and enthusiastic audience capable of supporting beautiful work at all price points.<br />
<br />
The show takes place on two consecutive weekends, <strong>June 8,9 and June 15, 16, 2013.</strong> You can apply to either or both weekends.<br />
<br />
The Annual American Crafts Festivals at Lincoln Center traditionally host over 100,000 visitors each and are consistently the best crafts festivals in the New York City and tri-state metropolitan area. In addition to robust sales, often-exceeding $15,000 per weekend per capita, significant wholesale purchases have also been made at this event. Record sales due to visitors from the entire Megalopolis have made this the event of choice in the New York Area. New Yorkers, suburbanites, tourists and theater constituents all contribute to these banner sales. In addition, presents for weddings, graduation and Father&#39;s Day are timely contributions.<br />

<strong>THE ANN ARBOR STREET ART FAIR, THE ORIGINAL- currently closed</strong><br />
The Ann Arbor Street Art Fair is the original of a collective of four concurrent and contiguous fairs that transform central Ann Arbor into a massive outdoor art gallery each July. Established in 1960 and still true to its mission of increasing public knowledge and appreciation for contemporary fine arts and fine crafts, the Original Ann Arbor Art Fair presents consistently high quality, all original work. Located on the streets surrounding the historic Burton Carillon Tower and the tree-lined central campus of the University of Michigan, the Street Art Fair, the Original, does not host sidewalk sales, buy/sell vendors, or non-artist vendors. The Street Art Fair is the only Ann Arbor fair to be named to AmericanStyle&rsquo;s list of Top-Ten Art Fairs and is known for attracting collectors, corporate buyers, and gallery representatives. The combined Ann Arbor Art Fair draws more than 500,000 fairgoers from across the nation. Join us as we celebrate our 54th year of Originality in Ann Arbor!</p>

The overwhelmingly successful Autumn Crafts Festival at Lincoln Center is back!<br />
With the American Crafts Festival at Lincoln Center, it is one of the two premier craft marketing events in the New York Metro area. The 24th Annual Autumn Crafts Festival takes place at Lincoln<br />
Center for the Performing Arts, the most prestigious arts centers in the world. That association has always connoted the highest level of craftsmanship which attracts, year after year, a very large, astute, and enthusiastic audience capable of supporting beautiful work at all price points.<br />
<br />
<br />
The show takes place on two consecutive weekends,<strong> October 5,6 and October 12,13, 2013.</strong> You can apply to either or both weekends.<br />
<br />
<br />
The annual Crafts Festivals at Lincoln Center traditionally host over 100,000 visitors each and are consistently the best crafts festivals in the New York City and tri-state metropolitan area. In addition to robust sales, often-exceeding $8,000 per weekend per capita, significant wholesale purchases have also been made at those events. Record sales due to visitors from the entire Megalopolis have made the Autumn Crafts Festival at Lincoln Center the event of choice, in the autumn, in the New York Area. New Yorkers, suburbanites, tourists and theater constituents all contribute to its banner sales. In addition, presents for the winter holiday season are timely contributions.<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to our own enormous mailing list of metropolitan area qualified crafts customers, there are thousands of theatre goers that afford expensive tickets, tourists from all over the world who come to Lincoln Center, a tourist must see destination and buy an abundance of unique American crafts. All of this is in a neighborhood where apartments cost millions of dollars.<br />
<br />
The number of participants in each craft area will be carefully balanced so as to afford all participants their fair share of this abundantly rich market.</p>

            <p>The Bar Harbor Fine Arts Festival is entering it&#39;s 6th year as one of the top arts events in Maine. Held on the grounds of Bar Harbor&#39;s premier luxury hotel; The Bar Harbor Inn, the festival is strategically located in the middle of town on the harbor waterfront. Artists and patrons alike agree that the location is an ideal venue for this upscale arts event. The show is held at the peak of the tourist season in Bar Harbor and traveling artists are encouraged to combine the show with other New England shows--like the sister Northeast Harborfest held the weekend before on the other side of the island--and/or a creative working vacation. Few places in the world are as inspiring and beautiful as Acadia National Park. Jurying will be by periodic &quot;rolling jury&quot;</p>

            <p>The Boca Raton Fine Art Show focuses on the visual arts. Work is top quality and every effort is made to keep out all buy/sell. The event was&nbsp;moved in 2013 to the heart of Downtown Boca Raton. We close Federal Highway,&nbsp;betwen NE 2nd St.&nbsp;&amp; Palmetto Park Road, two blocks south of the Boca Raton Museum. The location likely has an effect on the type of patrons it draws, who trend toward affluence with &ldquo;money to spend&rdquo;.<br />

            <p>The Boston Mills Artfest is a nationally recognized fine art and fine craft show. 2013 marks the 42nd consecutive year that the Artfest will be held Rain or Shine at Boston Mills Ski Resort, nestled in the scenic Cuyahoga Valley National Park midway between Cleveland and Akron.<br />
<br />
As a professional artist, why should the Boston Mills Artfest be on your summer schedule? First and foremost, because Boston Mills is committed to putting on a high-quality art show every year, and we understand that great shows are made up of two components: talented artists, and savvy patrons. We strive to attract both.<br />
<br />
Positive word-of-mouth from satisfied customers is our best publicity, of course, but we work tirelessly and year-round to publicize the Artfest. More than 50,000 postcards are sent out to households who have visited the Artfest in previous years, or are in locations with our targeted demographics. Cleveland Magazine prints the show programs and inserts copies into their June issue for distribution. Boston Mills also cultivates media and corporate partnerships to maximize the dollars we put into each year&#39;s advertising on a mix of billboards, print, and radio.<br />
<br />
Ron Beahn, a local working artist with many years of experience in art show promotion, serves as the Boston Mills Artfest Director and helps us to keep our show very artist-friendly. From the Artist Dinner before the show&#39;s Preview to the daily newsletters, food discounts, and open communication lines, we strive to make doing our show as easy as possible for all of our Exhibitors.<br />
<br />
The Boston Mills Artfest consists of two separate shows on consecutive weekends. For 2013, the first weekend will be June 28th-30th and the second weekend will be July 5th-7th.<br />
<br />
Deadline for applications for the 2013 Boston Mills Artfest has been extended to February 7, 2013.</p>

            <p>The CCAD Art Fair fills the Loann Crane Center for Design with 125 tables of CCAD artists who represent a wide variety of media and price points. Our artists keep 100% of the profits on cash and check sales after paying the application and table fee. (There is a 3% transaction fee for credit-card sales). Applicant exhibitors will be judged based on student or non-student standing, allocating 60% of the tables to current students and 40% to non-students (alumni, faculty, and staff), while limiting the number of CCAD employees to the top 9 scores and highlighting them in the Faculty/Staff room (Crane Multipurpose Room).</p>

            <p>Our festival is just like our town&#39;s name - one of a kind! The Clara Brierly Festival of the Arts (CBFOA) gives a nod to our history of Chautauqua in downtown Peculiar, Missouri (southern tip of the Kansas City Metro area). The event is named for local, outsider artist Clara Brierly. Our festival is a low key, friendlier paced event. The combination indoor/outdoor event is held in the shadow of the 1908, rock building which was formerly a Methodist church (with amazing, turn of the century stained glass windows) at 163 W. Center St., Peculiar, MO. The buildings and surrounding grounds are now the campus of the Downtown Peculiar Arts &amp; Culture District (DPACD); a 501(c)(3) not for profit organization dedicated to the revitalization of our Downtown as an arts district. The CBFOA is a key piece of our Downtown revitalization effort (we are a Missouri Main Street Connection Affiliate grantee, a member of the Missouri Association for Community Arts Agencies and a Missouri Arts Council Creative Community nominee). We are an all volunteer staff. Unlike some for profit festivals, we won&#39;t take your money and then leave you on your own! We spend the majority of the year working on this event (among others) and we do all we can to make it an experience you will enjoy, remember and return to each year. Per their post festival surveys, most of our artist vendors do as well at our festival with regard to sales as they do in the larger events held around us; we do believe this is due to increased &quot;face time&quot;. The Downtown Peculiar Arts &amp; Culture District (DPACD) gives out Purchase Awards as part of the festival. This year we are fortunate enough to have two, large draw, anchor acts who have committed to actively partner with us to attract crowds as well as numerous smaller draws throughout the weekend to pull constant foot traffic. If you have &quot;heART&quot;, you belong here.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Downtown Silver Spring Fine Art Festival</strong> returns to Ellsworth Drive in the heart of downtown Silver Spring, MD.&nbsp; Located in Montgomery County, Silver Spring is a major business hub situated at the north apex of Washington, D.C.&nbsp;Ellsworth Drive typically draws 20,000 visitors on a non-event weekend in May.&nbsp; Proximity to the Washington DC markets and built-in local audience makes this an ideal location for a fine art festival. The Downtown Silver Spring shopping district features an eclectic mix of entertainment, restaurants, retail, offices and a brand new Courtyard by Marriott Hotel.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Paragon has held four events in Downtown Silver Spring through 2012. The first event in 2011 placed in the Top 100 fine art festivals nationwide. At that time the event extended on Ellsworth Drive both east and west of the Fenton Street. We have decided to decrease the show to a maximum of 50 artists as we have seen an inconsistency in the crowds visiting the east and west sections of the show. Our national and corporate sponsorship is extremely strong in the Silver Spring market. Their support will continue to help underwrite this event which combined with the smaller size, will give artists a greater likelihood of success in this market.<br />

            <p>Evansville, IN - As Indiana’s third largest city, Evansville is a great place to live, work and play.  Evansville is the Metropolitan Center for the Tri-State Regions of southwest Indiana, northwest Kentucky and southern Illinois.  Hot Works goal is to build this event to be one of the best in the Midwest.  Hot Works has met with City Officials who have agreed to work together on making this event a huge regional success.  As always, Hot Works will heavily promote the event, including local broadcast TV, print, media, radio and social media.  The Convention & Visitors Bureau has agreed to market the event outside of Evansville, to reach the nearby cities of St. Louis, Louisville, Nashville and Indianapolis.  The event will open with a ribbon cutting ceremony, hosted by Mayor Lloyd Winnecke.  The University of Evansville and the University of Southern Indiana will both be participating with an Emerging Artists section.  The Southwest Indiana Arts Council will be part of the event, too, and will help Hot Works reach out to the local artists.  With plenty of free parking, this city has great potential for this kind of event.  The event takes place at The Centre, a beautiful indoor facility that is accustomed to consumer events.</p>

            <p>The Fall Festival on Ponce is a two day outdoor local arts and crafts event held on October 19-20, 2013 at the Olmsted Parks along Ponce de Leon Ave., a main thoroughfare in metro Atlanta.  This event was such a success in 2010 that we decided to split it in two (one festival in spring, one festival in fall)!  The festival supports the historic Olmsted Parks restoration.  This celebration of community and tradition is located in the center of the historic affluent North Druid Hills neighborhood in Atlanta.  Lots of trees, huge open green space and tons of visibility make this an irresistible event for artists.</p>

            <p>Twice as funky as the average fine art show...<br />
<br />
Not every art lover desires, or can afford ten thousand dollar art works. That does not mean that they are not people of taste, interested in aquiring quality work. The Funky Ferndale Art Fair is directed at people with an appreciation for the best.<br />
Ferndale&rsquo;s vibrant downtown attracts people in their 20&rsquo;s, 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s. It is a lively community with varied shopping and exciting clubs and restaurants. These people have the means to purchase items that appeal to them.<br />
Their taste in art tends toward less pastoral, more active work. While traditional images do sell, this show focuses on the unusual.<br />
We have as many as 40,000 shoppers attending over the weekend.&nbsp; Rent is $295 for a standard 10x10 booth.</p>

            <p>The location for our greater Charlotte art festivals (<strong>Lake Norman Fine Art Festival</strong> and <strong>Greater Charlotte Fine Art Festival</strong>) is Birkdale Village in Huntersville, NC. Huntersville is in the community of Lake Norman, one of the richest and most exclusive markets in the Greater Charlotte area. Birkdale Village is a life-style venue with numerous restaurants, stores, cafes, apartments, townhouses, and private residences. The show sets up on the beautiful tree-lined Concourse through the middle of Birkdale Village. These are ingredients to create a powerful venue for the 2013 events.<br />
<br />
Our fall 2012 Lake Norman event was well received by the public. Artists with expensive two-dimensional work, jewelry, and glass fared best in this inaugural year. The community was responsive with strong attendance on Saturday. On Sunday the crowd was slower to develop and remained lighter than on Saturday, although Sunday delivered big buyers. Patrons were delighted by the event, in particular surprised at the high quality of artwork. The show will remain a small boutique-style show of 78-80 artists.<br />

The<strong> Greater Dallas Fine Art Festival</strong> returns to the <strong>Village at Fairview</strong> in the town of Fairview, TX. The Village draws not only from the Town of Fairview and City of Allen but also from the cities of Plano, McKinney, Frisco, Richardson and Dallas.&nbsp; The site, located at the intersection of Stacy Road and US 75 is only 26 miles north of downtown Dallas. The Village at Fairview is a beautiful 200-acre mixed-use lifestyle development featuring over a million square feet of retails stores and 675 multi-family residential units. The property offers main street style shopping anchored by Dillard&#39;s and Macy&#39;s along with Whole Foods Market. The Fairview Town Hall also is located at The Village.<br />
<br />
We received wonderful media support from both the Dallas Morning News and Star Publications helping to launch the inaugural show this past fall. Saturday was a steady flow of patrons while Sunday was slower but brought back customers (i.e., be-backs) and higher-ticket sales and more serious art buyers.&nbsp; Below is the average sales based on reports from 52 artists at the event.&nbsp; A few of the artists found a strong customer base and as a result, reported extremely high sales numbers.&nbsp; We knew those numbers ($4067) would skew (i.e., misrepresent) overall how artists fared.&nbsp; Thus, to calculate the average, sales were capped at $10,000.<br />

The <strong>Jersey Shore Fine Art Festival </strong>returns for its <strong>fifth year </strong>to the Ethel Jacobson field on <strong>Long Beach Island (LBI). &nbsp;</strong><strong>This event has the largest advertising schedule of any Paragon event. The event is sponsored by Gannett Newspapers and their affiliates.&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
As you all know, the Northeastern United States was brutalized by Tropical Storm Sandy in October. Specifically, Long Beach Island was severely hit and suffered damage. However, as of this writing the estimate from our hosts is more than 85% of the island is up and running. Those of you that have done shows post-hurricane realize that insurance settlements for lost and damaged possessions often leads to extensive redecorating that involves the purchase of new artwork.<br />
<br />
Given these extraordinary circumstances, Paragon is making a similarly extraordinary offer. &nbsp;The application deadline is being extended and most importantly<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<div style="text-align: center; ">
	<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">IF YOU ARE JURIED INTO THE EVENT - YOUR BOOTH FEE WILL BE FREE</span></strong></div>
<br />
Single or doubles, both will be free. &nbsp;The only cost will be $50 for those requesting corner booths. &nbsp;Both corner and double booths will be assigned on a first-come basis determined by the date payment is received for the corner or the request is received for a double booth.<br />
<br />
We have contacted our media sponsors and they are fully behind this concept and will be increasing their support of the event. &nbsp;Further, the Director of the Chamber of Commerce in Long Beach Island is reaching out to all their local media contacts and news media contacts out of New York City. This is becoming a regional effort to bring attention and support for the event to help the artists and the community of Long Beach Island.<br />

            <p>Apply to the Krasl Art Fair on the Bluff where estimated crowds of 70,000 plus converge annually on this beautiful resort town on the shores of Lake Michigan. The art fair is in downtown Lake Bluff Park overlooking Lake Michigan. Our mission is &ldquo;Bringing People and Art Together.&rdquo; Our goals include:<br />
Providing high quality art to the Midwest,<br />
Providing a nurturing environment for the artists,<br />
To be considered one of the best fine-art/fine craft fairs in the country and<br />
To provide jurying by judges who are &ldquo;experts in their fields.&rdquo;<br />
The Krasl Art Fair on the Bluff is the largest fund raiser for the Krasl Art Center&#39;s general education programs and exhibitions.<br />
Once a &ldquo;clothesline art fair&rdquo; in the early 1960s, Krasl Art Fair on the Bluff has become a nationally recognized and critically acclaimed event by artists, experts and patrons. The Krasl Art Fair on the Bluff continues to attract high-quality artists.<br />
The success of last year&rsquo;s event garnered the Krasl Art Fair on the Bluff an increased ranking from #24 to #20 on Sunshine Artist&rsquo;s list of &ldquo;200 Best&rdquo; fine art fairs. Among the reasons for this noteworthy ranking, Sunshine Artist magazine mentioned one painter who &ldquo;wished that they had brought more art to sell&rdquo;. Another artist noted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working fulltime doing art festivals for more than 20 years. I&rsquo;ve never been treated so well at any other show... artists are treated like royalty&rdquo;. Moreover, Greg Lawler&rsquo;s Art Fair Source Book gave in 2011 a rating of 8 out of 10 and a 32nd ranking with average sales of $4,704 to the Krasl Art Fair on the Bluff based on sales as reported by artists. (We do not have 2012 information to date.)<br />
The Krasl Art Center (KAC) is proud of these rankings and is excited by all of the positive feedback we continue to receive from the press, our dedicated volunteers, talented artists, and the community. &ldquo;The city of St. Joseph, along with the surrounding communities and businesses, should take pride in their contribution to the ranking of the Krasl Art Fair on the Bluff. Our continued success is due in-part to the enthusiasm, support and hospitality of the community.&rdquo; Sara Shambarger, Director of the Krasl Art Fair.</p>

The building&rsquo;s iconic neon sign has welcomed travelers from both sides of the Trinity River to the south side of downtown for over a decade.

&nbsp;<br />
Amidst a growing collection of art galleries, urban residences, restaurants and hotels, the Lamar Street Festival will take place on Lamar between Powhattan and Belleview Street with multiple indoor and outdoor stages featuring an eclectic array of North Texas bands and performances catering to all tastes and styles.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

The Do&ntilde;a Ana Arts Council, the organizer of the Arts Fair, is a non-profit 501(c)(3) arts organization that has supported and enhanced the arts and cultural life of Southern New Mexico for more than 40 years. The Arts Council&rsquo;s mission is to improve the quality of life in Las Cruces, Do&ntilde;a Ana County, and Southern New Mexico by ensuring that the performing, visual, and literary arts are an integral part of education, economic growth, and community development. The Do&ntilde;a Ana Arts Council organizes the Renaissance ArtsFaire (RenFaire), an annual outdoor festival and juried arts and crafts fair, and numerous other programs for the community. The Arts Council also manages and operates the historic Rio Grande Theatre, the oldest adobe theater in the Southwest. Proceeds from the Las Cruces Arts Fair will be used to support the Do&ntilde;a Ana Arts Council&rsquo;s many community programs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In 2013, the Arts Fair included a silent auction for the benefit of the Do&ntilde;a Ana Arts Council&rsquo;s programs and activities. Besides being a successful fundraiser, the silent auction provided a welcoming introduction to the variety of art that was found at the Arts Fair. Visitors had a chance to preview artists work in the silent auction before going into the main exhibition space. The 2014 Las Cruces Arts Fair will again include a silent auction.</p>

            <p>ONE DAY. <br />
FIFTY ARTISTS. <br />
SIXTEEN THOUSAND ADMIRERS.  <br />
AN ALARMINGLY SMALL CITY BLOCK.<br />
<br />
Greetings from the 21st Annual Marion Arts Festival, in Marion, Iowa (adjacent to Cedar Rapids, in Eastern Iowa).  Named by the Art Fair SourceBook as being among the Top 25 festivals in the nation for 2012, the MAF presents 50 artists, offering both fine art and fine craft to an audience of 16,000. <br />
<br />
Marion is a "vintage uptown" type of community, and a part of the Cedar Rapids metro area.  Our show is one-day, intimate and purposeful, with the mission to be an event through which you will thrive.  (Here, we're obligated to insert that we're volunteer-driven, kind of hokey and maybe more than a little mom-and-pop ... in good ways, mostly.)  There are no bands, there is no beer ... our festival is about the art.  (However, we do cop to falafel.)<br />
<br />
Our 2013 video greeting!  (Sadly, there's more dork where this came from at <a href="http://marionartsfestival.com">marionartsfestival.com</a>.)<br />

            <p>The thirty eighth annual show will be held &quot;Under the Trees of Old Chautauqua&quot; on August 17 and 18, 2013.<br />
<br />
The Pennsylvania Chautauqua sponsors an Art Show, as a community fundraiser, on the third full weekend in August. The Pennsylvania Chautauqua is a non-profit organization established in 1892 for the purpose of &quot;the advancement of literary, scientific, intellectual, physical and social welfare and the promotion of cultural and religious activities, recreation and entertainment&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
Mount Gretna is a small Victorian community founded in the late 1800&#39;s as a summer resort. Initially the only way for residents to reach their cottages in the woods was to travel by train. Gretna was a stop along the Cornwall/Lebanon line. Our streets were footpaths until automobiles became the mode of travel. Many of the original cottages surround an open-air playhouse where numerous cultural events are held. Our quaint atmosphere attracts many visitors every summer for music, theater, a visit to the local ice cream shop or just a walk in the woods and, of course, to the Art Show!</p>

            <p>The Salida Riverside Fine Arts Festival invites artists to exhibit in this regional juried fine arts event, August 10 and 11. The producers of this festival are dedicated to the arts and to providing an excellent venue for accomplished artists to show and sell works of art. Each year the comments of the exhibitors are reviewed and the producers incorporate those suggestions that will help to create a prosperous show. This is the fifth consecutive year and is a select show of excellent and diverse artists, with many returning each year. Our vision is to provide the local and visiting public and our exhibitors a memorable and high quality festival experience.<br />
<br />
Salida is located in the heart of the South Central Rockies and has the distinction of being one of &quot;America&#39;s best art towns&quot;, according to The 100 Best Art Towns in America, by author John Villani. White water rafting, &#39;Fourteener&#39; mountain hiking, horseback riding, many excellent area hot springs, world class river fishing and the charm of a small mountain town with 15 art galleries, unique boutiques and venues featuring local musicians make Salida a popular vacation spot. This is the beautiful area of the Rocky Mountains that inspired the artist Christo to propose his latest artwork, &quot;Over the River&quot;!<br />
<br />
The festival site is located on the banks of the Arkansas River in a picturesque willow tree filled park with lush green lawns in the downtown Historic District. Colorful kayakers, rafters and fly fishermen can be seen from the festival site and enhance the mood of the festival. Riverside Park Ampitheater features the best of local talent entertaining festival attendees and exhibitors. For more details visit the festival website www.coloradofestivalsandevents.com.<br />

            <p>The Spring Festival on Ponce is a two day outdoor local arts and crafts event held on April 13-14, 2013 at the Olmsted Parks along Ponce de Leon Ave., a main thoroughfare in metro Atlanta. This event was such a success in 2010 that we decided to do split it in two (one festival in spring, one festival in fall)! The festival supports the Olmsted Parks restoration. This celebration of community and tradition is located in the center of the historic affluent North Druid Hills neighborhood in Atlanta.</p>

The <strong>Westchester (Scarsdale) Festival of the Art</strong>s returns for its <strong>fifth year</strong> to central Westchester County, again graciously hosted by the Scardsdale Chamber of Commerce.&nbsp; The show sets up on the downtown streets of The Village amidst elegant Tudor architecture, high-end shops and surrounded by numerous parks and extensive green spaces. The median income for a family is over $200,000.&nbsp; Within a 25-mile radius are Manhattan, Armonk and Greenwich, CT.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This fine art festival is still in a growth stage. It offers the strongest regional demographics in terms of both wealth and culture. Artists that need volume sales may find this a challenging market. Average sales have risen each year for this show. The Festival tends to be a show where artists either succeed well - or do not. This is a small boutique show geared to a smaller but extremely affluent patronage that forms the Scarsdale-Westchester clientele base.<br />
