During his tenure there he conducted extensive studies of the social conditions of blacks in America. At the 1900 Paris World's Fair, DuBois created a full-scale exhibit of African American achievement since the Emancipation Procamation in industrial work, literature, and journalism. It included photodocumentation on educational institutions such as Tuskeegee, Fisk, and Howard. Congress approved of $15,000 for installation, and it was installed - off midway and in the Social Economy section of the Liberal Arts building where it languished compared with the negative Midway exhibits. In 1903 he wrote The Souls of Black Folk which serves as the underpinning of access to many of his ideas.<br />(<A title="" href="http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0history/hwny-dubois.html">http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/0history/hwny-dubois.html</A>)<br /><span></span><br /><span></span></div>
