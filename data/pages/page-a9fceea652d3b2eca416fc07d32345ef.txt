<p>The preseason of the NFL started with a bang, literally:<span id="more-444569"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Several incidents of fan-on-fan violence that occurred over the weekend&#8217;s NFL preseason games have prompted the mayors of San Francisco and Oakland to take action.</p>
<p>During the 49ers-Raiders game alone, there was a beating in a restroom, a huge brawl in the stands and two fans were shot in the parking lot of Candlestick Park after the exhibition was over.</p>
<p><strong>Watch video at the top</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The incidents &#8230; are completely unacceptable and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Fans come to our stadiums to enjoy an afternoon of football, not to be subjected to intimidation or violence,&#8221; the mayors said in a joint statement. &#8220;These games are family events and the types of images we witnessed last night have no place in our arenas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow was beaten badly outside of Dodgers Stadium after the season opener.</p>
<p>The epidemic of fan violence is not limited to the Bay Area. During the Ravens-Chiefs game on Saturday, a fight broke out between Ravens fans near the concession area which left two lying on the ground in pain.</p>
<p>NFL spokesman Greg Aiello issued a statement on fan violence, per ProFootballTalk.</p>
<p>    “We deplore the activities of a handful of fans at last night’s game and pledge our full support to Mayors Lee and Quan and to state and local law enforcement agencies,” Aiello said. “We are carefully reviewing the events to make sure we have a full understanding of the facts. We will continue to work closely with our clubs and law enforcement agencies to support our fan conduct and stadium security initiatives.”</p>
<p>Of course, 2011 isn&#8217;t the first time that we&#8217;ve seen ugly scenes like these.</p>
<p>Just last year, videos were recorded of Redskins fans fighting each other, Chargers and Raiders fans going at it in the parking lot and even a fight in the stands during the U.S. Open.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flip the pizzage to see the Ravens and Chiefs fans brawl ending in somebody &#8220;knocked the fk out!&#8221;</p>
