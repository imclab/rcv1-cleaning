<p>Apparently when Australia called it Queensland, they were talking about <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/pink" target="_blank">P!nk</a></strong>!</p>
<p>The <em>Just give Me A Reason</em> singer hasn't just completely dominated Melbourne with her <em>Truth About Love</em> tour.</p>
<p>Not only has she sold 250,000 tickets just in Melbourne (breaking <strong>AC/DC</strong>'s record of 180,000), she's also broken the record for the most completely sold out shows with a massive 18!</p>
<p>That beats the old record of 17 set in 2009 by a nice young lady named... also P!nk! That's a heck of a coincidence! LOLz!</p>
<p>Gurl has also broken the record for most tickets sold at the Rod Laver Arena, where between all her tours through the country, she has now sold HALF A MILLION! Amazing!</p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out the pics (below) to see the new queen of the Outback claim her prize, which appears to be an adorable child who looks an awful lot like <strong>Willow Hart</strong>...</p>

<p>The reigning Princess of Pop for more than a decade has been the one, the only, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/britney-spears" target="_blank">Britney Spears</a></strong>!</p>
<p>Others have tried to take her crown before, but the hits just keep on coming for BritBrit!</p>
<p>But is <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/selena-gomez" target="_blank">Selena Gomez</a></strong> next in line to the throne?!?</p>
<p>Many have compared Selenita to her idol, who she's been admittedly obsessed with since Spears' first album came out.  Selena recently told reporters just how BIG a Britney fan she was back in the day.  She remembered:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I saved up all my money.  I was 11 years old and <em>...Baby One More Time</em> was my first CD and first tour that I ever saw.  Obviously she's a big influence in music and I just think she's the pop princess.  I hope to make great music like her!"
</p></blockquote>
<p>At this weekend's <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/vmas/" target="_blank">VMAs</a></strong>, Selena came closer to the title by taking home her first Moonman.  She has a lot of catching up to do if she wants to be the next Britney Spears though, not only in trophies but in performances!</p>
<p>The same 11-year-old who bought <em>...Baby One More Time</em> was watching 10 years ago when Brit and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/madonna" target="_blank">Madonna</a></strong> shared a sensual <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-08-21-britney-spears-madonna-kiss-top-10-most-memorable-mtv-vma-moments" target="_blank">kiss</a> onstage at the 2003 VMAs.  </p>
<p>It was as if Madonna was passing on the torch with her tongue...</p>
<p>So would Selena ever lock lips with Britney in order to become the NEW top diva?!?</p>
<p>Her answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Um, yes!  I'm just gonna be real ... yes!"
</p></blockquote>
<p>Selena, the <a href="http://perez.ly/17jL69U" target="_blank">day</a> you do the deed with Britney up onstage, we <a href="http://perez.ly/1aMtn01" target="_blank">shall</a> gladly bow down before you and cry out, "All hail the Pop Princess!"</p>

<p><strong><em><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/glee/" target="_blank">Glee</a></em></strong>'s tribute episode to <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/cory-monteith/" target="_blank">Cory Monteith</a></strong>, which will feature the main characters dealing with the untimely death of Finn, will also see some familiar faces from the show's past and recurring characters!</p>
<p>Find out which cast members will make an appearance<strong>...AFTER THE JUMP!!!</strong></p>
<p>According to sources, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/amber-riley/" target="_blank">Amber Riley</a></strong>'s  Mercedes, <strong>Harry Shum Jr.</strong>'s Mike Chang, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/mark-salling/#sthash.TQHwCRK8.dpbs" target="_blank">Mark Salling</a></strong>'s Puck, and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/jayma-mays/#sthash.MsyIfkLO.dpbs" target="_blank">Jayma Mays</a></strong>'s Emma all will appear in the episode.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>Dot-Marie Jones</strong> who plays Coach Bieste, <strong>Mike O'Malley</strong> who portrays Burt Hummel, and of course, <strong>Romy Rosemont</strong> who will have the heartbreaking job of playing Carole Hudson-Hummel, Finn's mother.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Mathew Morrison</strong> has dished that filming the episode has understandably been "incredibly hard" for everyone:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We've mourned Cory, but now we're mourning Finn. So it's kind of like two people in that one person."</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems fitting that members of the <em>Glee</em> family past and present will get to mourn both a wonderful actor and character in what has been <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-08-23-glee-begins-production-gut-wrenching-cory-monteith-tribute-episode#sthash.ruUtHwVS.dpbs" target="_blank">described</a> as an episode that "will make you cry from beginning to end."</p>
<p>Our hearts continue to go out to everyone working on <em>Glee</em>. We can't imagine how tough and extremely personal this <a href="http://perez.ly/17jzPX7" target="_blank">episode</a> has been to film.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/vin-diesel/#sthash.ZbNtBtTR.dpbs" target="_blank">Vin Diesel</a></strong> got super <em>xXx</em>cited on Monday when he received his very own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame!</p>
<p>Vin was accompanied by his family, his <em>Riddick</em> co-star, <strong>Katee Sackhoff</strong>, and from the <em>Fast & Furious</em> franchise, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/michelle-rodriguez/" target="_blank">Michelle Rodriguez</a></strong> and <strong>Jordana Brewster</strong>. </p>
<p>We bet Michelle was like "party at my place" and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/robert-pattinson/" target="_blank">Robert Pattinson</a></strong> popped out of some nearby bushes and was like "can I <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-08-12-robert-pattinson-it-felt-like-love-party-michelle-rodriguez" target="_blank">come</a>?" LOLz!</p>
<p>What a wonderful ceremony! Really, all it needed was a sweaty <a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/michelle-rodriguez/" target="_blank">Rock</a> and it'd be complete!</p>
<p>With <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-06-27-vin-diesel-books-mystery-meeting-with-marvel-maybe-to-discuss-avengers-role" target="_blank">rumors</a> that he might be joining <em>The Avengers</em>, and with <em>Fast</em> sequels showing no signs of stopping their furious domination of the box office (we predict Vin will be 87 in the final <em>Fast and Furious</em> movie), Vin is, as a vampire version of <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/charlie-sheen/" target="_blank">Charlie Sheen</a></strong> might put it, "vinning."</p>
<p>Congratulations go out to Vin! Although the characters you play never get walked on, we hope that many tourists walk on your star for centuries to come!</p>
<p>Hmm we wonder if getting your own star comes with a free and/or stolen car?</p>

<p>Hope the porn king was wearing a raincoat, because the you-know-what just hit the fan!</p>
<p><em>Girls Gone Wild</em> founder <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/joe-francis/" target="_blank">Joe Francis</a></strong> was hauled out of a courtroom in handcuffs minutes ago when a judge sentenced him to 270 days in a county jail for attacking a woman in his home back in 2011.</p>
<p>Joe was <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-05-07-girls-gone-wild-creator-joe-francis-found-guilty/" target="_blank">convicted</a> months ago on several counts of assault, false imprisonment, and "dissuading a witness from reporting," and today the judge wasn't feeling especially lenient.</p>
<p>Not only will he serve AT LEAST 270 days in jail, but he will also face three years of probation, one year of psychological counseling, and he must also complete a Level 3 Anger Management course.</p>
<p>The judge hit him with more than just the book, too. He harshly criticized Joe's uncontrollable temper!</p>
<p>Joe had demanded a retrial after being convicted of all those charges that stemmed from three women accusing him of not allowing him to leave his Hollywood mansion and even choke-slamming one of them into the floor.</p>
<p>Instead, the <em>GGW</em> mogul faces <a href="http://perez.ly/1aMQUOv" target="_blank">serious</a> time in the pokey for a very serious crime.</p>
<p>Do U think the sentencing was too harsh? Too lenient? Does Joe's punishment fit his crimes??</p>

<p>While everyone at the <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/vmas/" target="_blank">VMAs</a></strong> on Sunday was watching <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/miley-cyrus/" target="_blank">Miley Cyrus</a></strong> getting <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-08-25-miley-cyrus-twerks-robin-thicke-mtv-vmas-2013-blurred-lines-gif-awesome-sex/" target="_blank">twerky</a>, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/demi-lovato/" target="_blank">Demi Lovato</a></strong> was at Disneyland getting some turkey with her boyfriend <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/wilmer-valderrama/" target="_blank">Wilmer Valderrama</a></strong>, whose name sounds straight out of the Matterhorn!</p>
<p>Hey, everyone needs as much protein as they can get during a day at a <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/disney/" target="_blank">Disney</a></strong> theme park! Although eat too many turkey legs, and you might have to give your heart a break!</p>
<p>Demi knows that attending the VMAs can't really compare to getting to go around Disney with your own personal VIP tour guide. They're so informative!</p>
<p>Perhaps Demi found out that the stretching room in the Haunted Mansion actually drops down in order for you to pass underneath the Disneyland Railroad.</p>
<p>Or that there's a painting of Eeyore in the projection room on The Indiana Jones Adventure because the ride was built on the old Eeyore parking lot.</p>
<p>Or that Sleeping Beauty's Castle is actually backwards.</p>
<p>This VMA rebel probably had a Fantasmic time, and who knows, maybe she got to be the rebel spy on Star Tours as a result! </p>
<p>Demi just proved that it's a small world after all by spending her birthday in <a href="http://perezhilton.com/perezitos/2013-08-21-demi-lovato-serenaded-africa-21st-birthday" target="_blank">Africa</a>, but we wish (upon a star) that she got to go on the ride It's a Small World (which is about as long as a flight to Africa).</p>
<p>Although shades are necessary, we just hope that if Demi went on Big Thunder, she knew that she best remove her glasses, because that there's the wildest ride in the wilderness!</p>
<p>Hmm we wonder if Demi got to get dinner at the uber exclusive Club 33 that's located in New Orleans Square?</p>

<p>Oh for the love of Christmas!!!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/alec-baldwin" target="_blank">Alec Baldwin</a></strong> is being accused of attacking yet ANOTHER photographer!</p>
<p>The new dad was seen out in <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/new-york" target="_blank">New York</a></strong> with his wife <strong>Hilaria</strong> who just gave birth to their baby <a href="http://perezhilton.com/perezitos/2013-08-23-alec-baldwin-hilaria-thomas-its-a-girl-carmen-gabriela-twitter-congratulations-carmen-gabriela" target="_blank">daughter</a> on August 23rd.  </p>
<p>Witnesses say when a photog tried to snap a shot of the two together, Alec suddenly lunged at the cameraman!</p>
<p>Take a look at Alec PINNING the guy against a car!</p>
<p>Holy shiz!!!  Talk about a take down!</p>
<p>Reps for Mr. Baldwin reportedly said the photographer was the aggressor in the incident.  But after calling the NYPD, the photographer was quick to point out that HE was the victim in all of this!  He stated: </p>
<blockquote><p>"All I can say is I was doing my job asking him normal questions and he flipped. That's all."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hilaria was seen ducking into a tea store to avoid getting her picture taken.  </p>
<p>Police arrived on the scene shortly after the alleged attack and spoke to Alec and the photographer.  Both men admitted to pushing and shoving each other and agreed to walk away from the situation without pressing charges.</p>
<p>We don't know WHAT this paparazzo <a href="http://perez.ly/14AX8x2" target="_blank">said</a> to provoke Alec to do this, but c'mon, Mr. Baldwin!  </p>
<p>Can you REALLY still not know how to keep your temper under control???</p>

Kelly Clarkson isn't the only one who is less than impressed by Miley Cyrus' sexually-charged VMA performance! 
In fact, the harshest critic so far has got to be pop icon Cyndi Lauper.

<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kelly-clarkson/" target="_blank">Kelly Clarkson</a></strong> isn't the only one who is less than <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-08-26-kelly-clarkson-tweets-about-vmas-maybe-calling-out-miley-cyrus" target="_blank">impressed </a>by <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/miley-cyrus/" target="_blank">Miley Cyrus</a></strong>' sexually-charged VMA <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-08-25-miley-cyrus-twerks-robin-thicke-mtv-vmas-2013-blurred-lines-gif-awesome-sex" target="_blank">performance</a>! </p>
<p>In fact, the harshest critic so far has got to be pop icon <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/cyndi-lauper/" target="_blank">Cyndi Lauper</a></strong>. </p>
<p>In a radio interview with Australia's <em>Brig & Lehmo</em>, Cyndi slammed: </p>
<blockquote><p>"That was girl gone wild. So sad, so sad. She's in a song that literally says that the blurred lines allowed you to—when a woman says no, she means yes—and that's frightful because that's date rape. And there she is a young twenty-something trying to prove she can hang with the big boys and girls, you know, basically simulating a Girl Gone Wild video onstage and I just felt like that was so beneath her and raunchy, really raunchy. It wasn't even art."</p></blockquote>
<p>Art it was not, but we're not so sure that was her intention. </p>
<p><em>Girls Gone Wild</em>-esque? Sure. However, we're not so sure it's fair to point the big fat foam finger at Miles for promoting date rape since it's not even her song.</p>
<p>And art it was not, but <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/adam-lambert/" target="_blank">Adam Lambert</a></strong> is not so sure that was her intention. </p>
<p>The rare celeb to come to Smiley's defense mused: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Listen if it wasn't ur cup of tea--- all good but why is everyone spazzing? Hey - she's doin something right. We all talking."</p></blockquote>
<p>We couldn't agree more! </p>
<p>Some of us may not have liked her eXXXtra racy delivery, but we are ALL <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/452692/miley-cyrus-vma-performance-cyndi-lauper-says-it-encourages-date-rape-while-adam-lambert-defends-her?cmpid=rss-000000-rssfeed-365-topstories&utm_source=feedly" target="_blank">talking</a> about it days later.</p>
<p>Anyway, wasn't it Cyndi who said <em>girls just want to have fun</em>? She's just being Miley! </p>
