Many of the dates of play performances, when they were written, adapted or revised and printed are imprecise. This biography attempts only to give an overview of his life, while leaving the more learned perspectives to the countless scholars and historians who have devoted their lives to the study and demystification of the man and his works.</p><br><p>England's celebration of their patron Saint George is on 23 April, which is also the day claimed to be the birth date of Shakespeare. Although birth and death dates were not recorded in Shakespeare's time, churches did record baptisms and burials, usually a few days after the actual event. The infant William was baptised on 26 April 1564 in the parish church Holy Trinity of Stratford upon Avon. He lived with his fairly well-to-do parents on Henley Street, the first of the four sons born to John Shakespeare (c1530-1601) and Mary Arden (c1540-1608), who also had four daughters. John Shakespeare was a local businessman and also involved in municipal affairs as Alderman and Bailiff, but a decline in his fortunes in his later years surely had an effect on William.</p><br><p>In his younger years Shakespeare attended the Christian Holy Trinity church, the now famous elegant limestone cross shaped cathedral on the banks of the Avon river, studying the Book of Common Prayer and the English Bible. In 1605 he became lay rector when he paid ï¿½440 towards its upkeep, hence why he is buried in the chancel. Early on Shakespeare likely attended the Elizabethan theatrical productions of travelling theatre troups, come to Stratford to entertain the local official townsmen, including the Queen's Men, Worcester's Men, Leicester's Men, and Lord Strange's Men. There is also the time when Queen Elizabeth herself visited nearby Kenilworth Castle and Shakespeare, said to have been duly impressed by the procession, recreated it in some of his later plays.</p><div style = 'float: left; margin-right: 7px;'><script type="text/javascript">

</div><br><p>Although enrolment registers did not survive, around the age of eleven Shakespeare probably entered the grammar school of Stratford, King's New School, where he would have studied theatre and acting, as well as Latin literature and history. When he finished school he might have apprenticed for a time with his father, but there is also mention of his being a school teacher. The next record of his life is in 1582, when still a minor at the age of eighteen and requiring his father's consent, Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway (1556ï¿½1623) married in the village of Temple Grafton. Baptisms of three children were recorded; Susanna (1583-1649), who went on to marry noted physician John Hall, and twins Judith (1585-1662) who married Richard Quiney, and Hamnet (1585-1596) his only son and heir who died at the age of eleven.</p><br><p>It is not exactly clear what Shakespeare was doing in the first few years after the marriage, but he did go to London and worked at The Globe theatre, possibly as one of the Queen's Men whose works were harshly anti Catholic in a time of rising Protestantism. He was writing poems and plays, and his involvement with theatre troupes and acting is disparagingly condemned in a 1592 pamphlet that was distributed in London, attributed to Robert Green the playwright titled "Groats Worth of Witte" haughtily attacking Shakespeare as an <I>"upstart crow"</I>;</p><br><BLOCKQUOTE><I>"Yes trust them not: for there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tyger's hart wrapped in a Player's hyde, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you: and beeing an absolute Iohannes fac totum [Jack-of-all-trades, Master of none], is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a countrey. O that I might entreate your rare wits to be employed in more profitable courses: &amp; let these Apes imitate your past excellence, and never more acquaint them with your admired inventions."</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br><p>By 1593 the plague was haunting London and many who were able fled the teeming city for the cleansing airs of open country. While it was a time for many upstart theatres, the popular public entertainment of the day, they were often shut down and forbidden to open for stretches of time. Shakespeare probably spent these dark days travelling between London, Stratford, and the provinces, which gave him time to pen many more plays and sonnets. Among the first of his known printed works is the comedic and erotically charged Ovidian narrative poem <I>Venus and Adonis</I> (1593). It was wildly popular, dedicated with great esteem to his patron Henry Wriothesly, third earl of Southampton, the young man that some say Shakespeare may have had more than platonic affection for. It was followed by the much darker <I>The Rape of Lucrece</I> in 1594, <I>The Passionate Pilgrim</I> in 1599 and the allegorical <I>The Phoenix and the Turtle</I> (1601).</p><br><p>At this time of prolific writing, Shakespeare began his association until his death with The Lord Chamberlain's Men. With the accession of James I they became the King's Men, who bought and performed most of Shakespeare's plays. The troupe included his friend and actor Richard Burbage. They performed frequently at court, and in the theatres that Shakespeare was co-owner of including the Blackfriars, The Theatre, and The Globe in London until it burnt down during a performance of <I>King Henry VIII</I>. It is said that Shakespeare himself acted in a number of roles including the ghost in <I>Hamlet</I> and Old Adam in <I>As You Like It</I>. In the late 1590s he bought `New Place' on Chapel Street in Stratford, one of his many real estate investments.</p><br><p>Shakespeare wrote most of his plays as `quarto texts', that being on a sheet of paper folded four ways. A few of his plays were printed in his lifetime, though they appeared more voluminously after his death, sometimes plagiarised and often changed at the whim of the printer. <I>First Folio</I> would be the first collection of his dramatic works, a massive undertaking to compile thirty-six plays from the quarto texts, playbooks, transcriptions, and the memories of actors. The approximately nine hundred page manuscript took about two years to complete and was printed in 1623 as <I>Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies</I>. It also featured on the frontispiece the famous engraved portrait of Shakespeare said to be by Martin Droeshout (1601-c1651).</p><br><p>Under the favour of the court The Kings' Men became the eminent company of the day. Most likely Anne and the children lived in Stratford while Shakespeare spent his time travelling between Stratford and London, dealing with business affairs and writing and acting. In 1616 his daughter Judith married Quiney who subsequently admitted to fornication with Margaret Wheeler, and Shakespeare took steps to bequeath a sum to Judith in her own name. William Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616, according to his monument, and lies buried in the chancel of the Holy Trinity Church in Stratford upon Avon. While there is little known of her life, Anne Hathaway outlived her husband by seven years, dying in 1623 and is buried beside him. It is not clear as to how or why Shakespeare died, but in 1664 the reverend John Ward, vicar of Stratford recorded that <I>"Shakespeare, Drayton and Ben Johnson had a merie meeting, and itt seems drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a feavour there contracted."</I> His tombstone is inscribed with the following epitaph;</p><br><BLOCKQUOTE><I>Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare<br>To digg the dust encloased heare<br>Blessed by y man y spares hes stones<br>And curst be he y moves my bones</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br><p><B>Poetry</B></p><br><p>It is generally agreed that most of the Shakespearean Sonnets were written in the 1590s, some printed at this time as well. Others were written or revised right before being printed. 154 sonnets and "A Lover's Complaint" were published by Thomas Thorpe as <I>Shake-speares Sonnets</I> in 1609. The order, dates, and authorship of the Sonnets have been much debated with no conclusive findings. Many have claimed autobiographical details from them, including sonnet number 145 in reference to Anne. The dedication to "Mr. W.H." is said to possibly represent the initials of the third earl of Pembroke William Herbert, or perhaps being a reversal of Henry Wriothesly's initials. Regardless, there have been some unfortunate projections and interpretations of modern concepts onto centuries old works that, while a grasp of contextual historical information can certainly lend to their depth and meaning, can also be enjoyed as valuable poetical works that have transcended time and been surpassed by no other.</p><br><p>Evoking Petrarch's style and lyrically writing of beauty, mortality, and love with its moral anguish and worshipful adoration of a usually unattainable love, the first 126 sonnets are addressed to a young man, sonnets 127-152 to a dark lady. Ever the dramatist Shakespeare created a profound intrigue to scholars and novices alike as to the identities of these people.</p><br><p><B>Tragedies</B></p><br><p>Some probably inspired by Shakespeare's study of <I>Lives</I> (trans.1597) by Greek historian and essayist Plutarch and Raphael Holinshed's <I>Chronicles</I> (1587). Some are reworkings of previous stories, many based on English or Roman history. The dates given here are when they are said to have been first performed, followed by approximate printing dates in brackets, listed in chronological order of performance.</p><br><p><I>Titus Andronicus</I> first performed in 1594 (printed in 1594),<br><I>Romeo and Juliet</I> 1594-95 (1597),<br><I>Hamlet</I> 1600-01 (1603),<br><I><a href = 'http://www.online-literature.com/caesar/'>Julius Caesar</a></I> 1600-01 (1623),<br><I>Othello</I> 1604-05 (1622),<br><I>Antony and Cleopatra</I> 1606-07 (1623), <br><I>King Lear</I> 1606 (1608),<br><I>Coriolanus</I> 1607-08 (1623), derived from Plutarch<br><I>Timon of Athens</I> 1607-08 (1623), and <br><I>Macbeth</I> 1611-1612 (1623).</p><br><p><B>Histories</B></p><br><p>Shakespeare's series of historical dramas, based on the English Kings from John to Henry VIII were a tremendous undertaking to dramatise the lives and rule of kings and the changing political events of his time.

<div class="cbox"><h3><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=75591">Is Shakespeare difficult to read for a present day English speaker</a></h3>


<p>Last night I started reading the preface of Gwynne's Grammar, which is another grammar, punctuation and style guide written by an opinionated curmudgeon (aren't they all). One thing he said was that the English language had not actually changed much over the past few centuries. New words had been added, but few had been lost or had changed their meaning. He said even Shakespeare could be read by a present day English speaker without much difficulty. I agreed with him about books written in the 19th century. I found there was not much vocabulary in Dickens or Austen that I did not understand. There was plenty of vocabulary in Hardy I did not understand, but I think that was because he was showing off. However, the biggest problem I had with Shakespeare at school was that I did not understand it, at least not without the teacher explaining it or the student notes.</p>

<div class="cbox"><h3><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=75350">Much Ado Rewritten As Musical</a></h3>


<p>We've been working on a modernization of "Much Ado" as a musical called BAM! and would be curious to hear your thoughts/suggestions.

First, the story is set in NYC, 1967.  Before things went totally crazy with Viet Nam War, riots, etc.  Since our source music has a very 60's Pop vibe, including some swingin' songs, it's working quite well.  Setting is Leo's magnificent penthouse where the returning "soldiers" (Merchant Marines) reside. Some of the characters have been renamed--Hero in now "Honor," Claudio is "Colton" and our most radical departure, Don John is a woman named "Dawn." 

Next, we modernized the dialog. Gasp! OMG! :smilewinkgrin: Our goal is to reach the masses; telling Shakespeare's great story with the music is paramount. To that end, we've made Ben a good ol' boy to play against Bea's more cultured persona.  Think Matthew McConaughey.  He uses Will Rogers/Mark Twain quotes as barbs while Bea taunts with "Southern simpleton" remarks.

Finally, we created a couple new subplots.  "Dawn" still concocts the evil deception that leads to the disaster at the altar.  But she's also involved in smuggling rare gems for the mob.  She gets her comeuppance when Claudio/Colton catches on to her scheme and thwarts her "big score." Dawn still has all the sullenness of Don John and her desire to cause mayhem with her half-brother Don Pedro drives her character.  And we have Colton pleading to Honor with a song called "What Do I Have To Do?" instead of the "surprise bride" in the original.

Of course we didn't forget Dogberry! We've made him and "Virgil" a couple bumbling doormen/security people with the same tendency toward malapropisms. 

As Ben might say, "What do y'all think?"

(If you search for "NYC Composer' on Google News, you will see more about the project.)</p>

<div class="cbox"><h3><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=74281">Monologue help- Fairly Urgent</a></h3>


<p>Hi everyone, just need some help with picking out a Shakespeare monologue for an audition. 
Needs to be about 12 lines and preferably not from one of the ones that are constantly done.
I was thinking along the lines of Julius, Merchant of Venice, Anthony and Cleo, Comedy of Errors or Titus.

I'm hoping for a monologue from a character that has some similarities to Mercutio from R&J, but I'm not familiar 
enough with the plays nor do I have enough time to do the in depth research before now and the audition AND 
keep up with my Math's assignments. 

If anyone has any suggestions at all on characters with similar to Mercutio at all from any play advice is very appreciated 
Thanks everyone :)</p>

<p>Do you find Shakespeare difficult to read?

In your opinion, is he the hardest to read, or are there other English writers who are harder to read (ie--Milton, Spenser, Chaucer, etc)?

What do you do to get through his plays? In other words, what do you do to understand his plays?</p>

<p>I am in need of assistance. I recently purchased a facsimile of Shakespeare's first folio. Upon comparing the text of the first folio of Hamlet to the text of another text of Hamlet, prepared by Arthur Henry Bullen, I am noticing a dramatic difference between the two.I am curious if anyone could tell me what sources Arthur Henry Bullen used to prepare his text, and why he deviated from the first folio so dramatically, in my opinion. Thank you.</p>

<div class="cbox"><h3><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=71284">Shakespeare must have hated Anne Hathaway</a></h3>


<p>I have just finishd reading a copy of Shakespeare's last will and testament. Please allow me to be angry.

What fine words did the 'Bard' devote to his cherished beloved?

"I give unto my wife my second best bed with the furniture"

That's it?  Not even the decency to mention her name!  If that wasn't enough of an insult, he used one sentence: a lousy twelve words after all those years of her caring for his brats, while in London, night after night, he poured sack down his miserly throat, and no doubt ended up with Syphallis.

What kind of person must he have been? Was that the same man who wrote the Sonnets?  "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?".  How could someone so into beatiful words be so insentitive to his woman?

What a prat. Why on earth people place flowers on his grave is beyond me. Better putting them on the bare, hardly noticed grave next to his: that of his little, inconsequential property, his 'wife', Anne Hathaway.

Why do people love such 'orrible little creeps?

disgusting.</p>

<div class="cbox"><h3><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=71161">Shakespeare and rape</a></h3>


<p>I'm far from well-versed in his works, which is why I'm likely to defer to your scholarly expertise. ;) What did Shakespeare believe of rape?

Wikipedia reads, "Lucrece is described as if she were a work of art, objectified in as if she were a material possession. Tarquin's rape of her is described as if she were a fortress under attack&#8212;conquering her various physical attributes."
It seems like he doesn't even consider her a person.

"Although Lucrece is raped, the poem offers an apology to absolve her of guilt."
So he thinks it's her fault?!

"Like Shakespeare's other raped women , Lucrece gains symbolic value: through her suicide, her body metamorphoses into a political symbol. Shakespeare turns rape into a form of wound or mutilation of Lucrece's flesh. The loss of chastity as a symbolic wound is closely associated to the self-inflicted stab wound which puts an end to Lucrece's life."
Does he really believe being raped demands suicide and a raped woman is a "political symbol"?

So I disquieted about this aspect of the guy I'm just discovering. Am I missing something?</p>

<p>This text, taken from the first page of Shakespeare's Sonnets (1609) is giving me grief, and I wondered if anyone might care to comment? The dedication in full reads:

TO.THE.ONLY.BEGETTER.OF.
THESE.ENSUING.SONNETS.
Mr.W.H. ALL.HAPPINESS.
AND.THAT.ETERNITY.
PROMISED.

ADVENTURER.IN.
SETTING.
FORTH.
                     T. T.


Ignoring the old-fashioned style and peculiar punctuation, what I am having difficulty with is that the grammar seems strange: all's well up to BY (in the sixth line), but then it kind of goes weird. What you think?

Thanks in advance for any assistance</p>

<div class="cbox"><h3><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=70279">Two Noble Kinsmen (or, the problem of expectations when starting a book/play)</a></h3>


<p>I am currently reading through Shakespeare's Two Noble Kinsmen because it is one of the last of his works that I have not read yet. I thought I would pause to reflect here and ask anyone who has read this play (or anyone in general) if the following has happened to them:

The popular story behind this play is that it is a collaborative work between Shakespeare and Fletcher. Thus, it is not "pure Shakespeare." I tried to get into the play without considering this fact but unfortunately my mind keeps jumping to "oh, that passage in the High Medieval rhetoric is not Shakespeare," or "these flat nameless characters are not indicative of Shakespeare."

There are parts of this play I am really enjoying (mainly the two eponymous characters) but I am unable to judge it without interference from the fact that this is a "lesser Shakespeare" compared to his others.

Has anyone who read Two Noble Kinsmen experienced this? Or, if you have not, can you read a work by what you consider a "bad author" without that stipulation? If the author of, let's say, Twilight published another book that had nothing to do with this series, could you read it without the expectation that it will be terrible?</p>
