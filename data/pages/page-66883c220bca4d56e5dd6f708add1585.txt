PART 1.  MECHANICAL INSPECTION CHECKLIST.


--- FIRST PHONE CONTACT:

     Name: ______________________________________            [affix original ad here]
     
  Address: ______________________________________

    Phone: (h) ______________  (w) ______________

Date/Time: ______________________________________


 1. Can you describe the car and its condition?
 2. Does it run well?
 3. How is the:
       Body?
       Any Rust?
       Paint?
       Interior?
       Tires?
       Engine?
       Brakes?
       Shocks?
 4. Does it have Overdrive or Turbo? Does it work?
 5. What special features or options does it have?
 6. Why are you selling it?
 7. How long have you owned it? ...had it for sale?
 8. Is it currently registered and licensed?
 9. Where is the car located?
10. How many miles does it have on it? [15K/yr?]
11. What problems have you had with the car?
12. Has it ever been hit or in an accident?
13. What work does it need done on it now?
14. How much are you asking for it? or What's the least you're willing
    to take for it?



---QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF:

Why am I buying this car?
What do I intend to do with it?
Will it be my commute vehicle?
What service and support is locally available?
Will I be driving it year-round or summer only?
Do I want to work on the car more than driving it?
Am I willing to pay a premium because someone else has already done most
of the serious work on the car?
What is the most that I'm willing to pay for this car?
What is the least that I think that the car can be had for?

--- SUGGESTIONS:

1. Read some of the &quot;How to buy Used Cars&quot; books available at your
library.  They provide useful strategies and cautions that go far beyond
the scope of this list.  Also, review this list carefully before using it.

2. Always inspect/take delivery of the vehicle in broad daylight,
never in the evening/night or in the rain.

3. A clean piece of cardboard placed under the engine/trans after the
test-drive will help show fluid leaks.

4. In some states, older non-titled vehicles may be titled with just a
bill of sale.  Other states may require an additional security bond to
be posted.  Use extreme caution in either of these cases!

5. Require seller have the vehicle pass all state inspections (safety,
emissions) at a mutually agreeable shop (NOT one of his choosing) before
you pay for it. Old (&gt;30days) inspections are of absolutely no use to you.

6. A general guide to reading exhaust smoke:

<strong>Black smoke</strong> = unburned fuel
   Valves bad or out of adjustment?  Carb out of adjustment?
<strong>Blue  smoke</strong> = burning oil
   Accelerating: Piston rings bad? Decelerating: Valve seats/guides bad?
<strong>White smoke</strong> = burning coolant!
   Bad head gasket? Warped or cracked Head or Block?$$

                         ODOMETER (MILEAGE) STATEMENT

the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972 (Pub. L.

I, the seller __________________________, state that the odometer
mileage on the vehicle described below now reads __________________
miles/kilometers.

Circle ONE only:

(1)   I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge the odometer
      reading as stated above reflects the actual mileage of the
      vehicle described below.

(2)   I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge the odometer
      reading as stated above reflects the amount of mileage in excess
      of designed mechanical odometer limit of 99,999 miles/kilometers
      of the vehicle described below.

(3)   I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge the odometer
      reading as stated above is NOT the actual mileage of vehicle
      described below and should not be relied upon.

      and I have no knowledge of anyone doing so.

(2)   I hereby certify that the odometer was altered for repair or
      replacement purposes while in my possession, and that the
      mileage registered on the repaired or replacement odometer was
      identical to that before such service.

(3)   I hereby certify that the repaired or replacement odometer
      was incapable of registering the same mileage, that it was
      reset to zero, and that the mileage on the original odometer
      or the odometer before repair was ________________ miles/kilometers.
