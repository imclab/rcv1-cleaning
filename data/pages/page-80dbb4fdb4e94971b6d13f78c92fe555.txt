      <p>I thought it might pose a good topic of discussion, for a site that is heavy with lovers of ‘arthouse’ films, to consider the difference between these and the more mainstream movies – besides the fact the former is likely sub-titled. I believe it is useful to think about the auteurs we like or don’t like, in terms of whether they are ‘arthouse’ or ‘mainstream entertainment’. Somebody might say, well, if it is entertaining to us, it really doesn’t matter, but let’s start with some examples of directors whose work we tend to put in one category or the other.</p>
<p>For example, few would deny that Steven Spielberg has created a large body of film work that is entertaining and commercially successful. We would probably not describe him as an ‘arthouse’ type of filmmaker. Peter Greenaway would be an example of an ‘arthouse’ filmmaker, who shuns the conventions of mainstream film media. James Cameron is mainly a purveyor of ‘entertainment’. David Lynch and David Cronenberg fall somewhere in between: they use some experimentation in  their work, but still rely largely on the conventions of mainstream film making. Where would we put directors like Woody Allen, Martin Scorcese, the Coen brothers, or Coppola? Most of their work would not be described as ‘arthouse’, yet they can produce films that we all respect and admire critically. Kubrick is in a class all by himself. He worked as an outsider to the mainstream, but used the existing conventions of cinema to create works that were artistic, but also aimed as works of ‘entertainment.’</p>
<p>The point I am trying to make (albeit, lamely), is why do we automatically respect the likes of Bergman, Godard, Fellini, or Antonioni over say: a Capra, Victor Fleming, Norman Jewison, James Cameron, or David Lean (Lean as epic maker, not his earlier career)? Is there inherently something more ‘worthwhile’ in the ‘arthouse’ variety of film and if so, why? Are directors that work for the more commercial mainstream film industry less deserving of our respect?</p>
<p>We all seem to know instinctively (on this site, I mean) what makes an interesting, provocative, or important ‘art film.’ Definitely, a movie that uses the medium in a new way, makes us think, has a philosophical position, or is an example of creative vision would be described as an ‘art film’ But are films that set out primarily to entertain us, to use all the latest techniques, gimmicks, or special effects inherently less worthwhile? As defenders of our select group of <em>auteurs</em> are the other directors and their films guilty pleasures? Should we feel guilty if we like Titantic, Harry Potter films, an Indian Jones movie, or any other ‘entertainment’ film? Where does the Lord of the Rings trilogy stand, in our estimation? Fellow auteurs, what do you think?</p>

      <p>There’s really no easy answer to this so-called conflict between art and entertainment. In a large way, I feel it’s a moot point and not something I tend to spend time thinking about. Film as an art form is within the same classification as literature, music, and theatre, in that it’s purpose is, and always has been/will be, both to entertain and to allow the artistic expression of it’s creator. All of these mediums are separate from the “high” arts of painting, sculpture and architecture, both because they demand to be separate by their very nature, but also because of the traditions and mind-sets of the society that appreciates them.</p>
<p>The only real issue, or conflict, to be had in regards to film, literature and music, is the presence of a massive corporate empire that realized long ago the profit to be made by these artistic mediums. This causes product to be put out into the market for the sole purpose of making money, with little to no regard for the quality of the finished work. And it works for them, it always has. Most people only want to be entertained, and will collectively pay billions of dollars a year to do so. But also, with the few exceptions that make a ridiculous amount of money, these movies will be forgotten as quickly as one month after they’ve been released, then replaced with others that are also eventually forgotten. It’s the natural cycle of the film “business”.</p>
<p>It’s two sides to the same coin, and a true connoisseur of the medium can see both the good and bad to be had with both. At the end of the road, the worthless and the worthwhile are both part of this human experiment called art. It all has it’s place.</p>

      <p>Hi. Names Matt. Film, is a business. Commercial film, is a business. Arthouse film, in the like, is also a business- the business of getting a film made. Commercial film looks at the financial bottom line whereas arthouse cinema thrives on the mere posibility of limited distribution. After all, art does no good if it cannot be viewed by the objective eye. Likewise, if you look for art in artfilm you’ll find it. At the same time if you look for entertaiment value in atrfilm, you’ll find it. Thus, my argument is that both commercial and art house film contain elements which can and will both satisfy your palate for pretension as well as your palate for gratuitous, mind-numbing explosions and softlit nudity.</p>

      <p>Thanks, Brandon. “<em>At the end of the road, the worthless and the worthwhile are both part of this human experiment called art. It all has it’s place</em>.” I think you illuminated what was at the back of my mind, but not clear to me in my first post. It probably is a mute distinction. Important works will always exist in both categories, and these are the works that will last. I think I am now understanding this better.<br>
Also, Matt: I’ll second the need for: <em>mind-numbing explosions and softlit nudity</em> .Where would film be without them? Thanks, guys.</p>

      <p>Personally, I consider all film to be art.  There is a creative aspect that goes into every film, and whether its goal is to be just entertainment, or a more complex, “intelligent” work doesn’t make a difference.  That doesn’t necessarily mean that the film will accomplish that goal—I’m sure everyone will agree there is a big difference between Indiana Jones and Gigli.  Some movies are just bad, but they all still have creativity to them.</p>
<p>I think almost every director deserves equal respect for what they do.  We just respect them for different reasons.  We admire directors like Godard and Bergman for creating thought provoking, stylish films.  We admire the big budget hollywood directors, like Cameron or Spielberg, for creating films that are highly successful and entertaining.  There are films that are bad, whether they are boring, stupid, or just plain unwatchable.  We don’t have to like those films, but at the very least we can recognize the work that was put in to making them.</p>

      <p>I think I’m just a suspicious of <em>art</em> films that eagerly announce their <em>artness</em> as any other kind of film made with priorities out of order, and with this I’m thinking of the rather large number of contemporary indie and international films that seem more interested in style over substance.  To me a film – art, or commercial – must tell me something I don’t know, make me see something differently, consider an idea in a different way, or at least take me on a real trip, and I tend to favor things that allow an audience (me) to get to know characters and situations on our own.  Of the great, canonical “auteurs,” the ones I’m most fond of do all of the above, in different ways, in every film, and my admiration for those films is personal first, before any intellectual considerations.  There is a lot of what might be described as “trash cinema” that I really, really love, and some of that is ironic, but some of it isn’t, beacause I find plenty of drive-in “auteurs” who do all of the same well enough, and things that migt qualify as kitsch tend to strike me as craftsmanship, of a variety I have a lot of respect for, because it’s as genuine in its’ communicative ability as anything.</p>
<p>I’ll single out Spielberg, because for all of the above, he runs the full spectrum for me – there are films of his I love, films I’m indifferent to, films I hate.  It’s case-by-case, and with him I think he occasionally tries too hard, on both the serious and the commercial front.  I think there are at least a couple films of his where the aim was lower, and the results ended up being far better than anyone should have had a right to expect.</p>
<p>In an earlier age, the greatest of “auteurs” were populists as much as they were intellectuals and artists, and I think the best film usually (not always) is still a product of people with a sense of all three sensibilities.  At this chronological distance it’s easy to forget that Alfred Hitchcock, Yasujiro Ozu, Billy Wilder, John Ford, Kenji Mizoguchi, Howard Hawks, Fritz Lang, Mikio Naruse and Akira Kurosawa made films that <em>a <strong>lot</strong> of people dug</em> , and thus they tried to do it as well, as thoughfully, as they could.  At this vantage point, the beauty and greatness of their finest films lies in the fact that they reward deep thought and suggest complex ideas and philosophies generations down the road; they are deeply, profoundly human.  Thus, we should be careful to not over-academicize them; this rips the heart out of them.  And I tend to think that even the most intrepid of <em>art</em> films, if they succeed, they do so because of a certain inventiveness in telling stories, and a precisely felt/processed/reflected upon engagement with the world.</p>
<p>The arthouse world has it’s own ghetto of crap:  I’m sure we can all think of films that strike us as insular, minor, hipper-than-thou, style-over-substance or too subcultural for their own good.  And to that, regardless of our pretenses, or taste, within whatever film world we think we gravitate towards, we’re still going to find a <strong>Gigli</strong> of our own.  Good is good, and bad is bad.</p>

      <p>Thanks for reviving this Matt – a topic that still needs more discussion, I think. But not from me – I am nowhere near as ‘profound’ as I was back three months ago. What I shock to be reading my own post for quite some time, before I recognized it as my own. Where are some of these original posters now like David-D-D that could really tackle a topic? In any case, anyone else is free to join in before this thread quickly vanishes again.</p>

      <p>guilt is something u should not feel for liking a certain film. i dont think anyone (or maybe its just me) automatically respects anything or anyone. respect is something that must be earned. the so called art house directors get respect for pieces that much deserve it. touching new topics. etcetera. movies that use the latest techniques gimmicks or visual effects are worthwhile if thats what you feel like watching. i dont think mainstream directors are less deserving of respect because at least they are making films that they want to and thats more than i can say for myself.</p>

      <p>Bob,</p>
<p>Of course there’s the whole issue of canonization. I made the point elsewhere that, among relatively sophisticated cinephiles, Kurosawa and Bergman are accepted as “great” more or less uncritically. Peter Wollen wrote in Sight &amp; Sound several years ago that the film canon was formed by “a motley set of cultural gate-keepers and taste-makers [archivists, critics and academics, festival programmers, filmmakers, the audience] . . .the process of cultural negotiation among these many gate-keepers of taste results not only in the surface phenomena of lists and programs, but also in the crystallization of an implicit aesthetic paradigm at a deeper level.”</p>
<p>So, in some sense we’re at the mercy of historical precedent, and at the mercy of those who decide what is green lighted, what preserved (think of how different things might be without Langlois and the Cinémathèque) what’s released on DVD (and what’s upscaled to Criterion, of course), what’s on film study syllabi, etc, as well as the Cahiers critics, Sarris’s pantheon, the Sight &amp; Sound/BFI polls, etc. We’re at the mercy of all this stuff, particularly while still novices—you have to acquire quite a bit of knowledge and experience before you can really look at the history of film critically.</p>

      <p>Of course this is difficult to wrap one’s arms around without clear definitions of both “art” and “entertainment” and we could spend a lifetime disagreeing on that.</p>
<p>The director of my local cinematheque wrote a great piece a few years ago lamenting people who suggest they “just want to be entertained” by cinema.  In it he argued that all cinema is entertainment.  Who goes to the movies hoping not to be entertained?  But entertainment isn’t just the process of being made happy.  It is often associated with escapism, but shouldn’t be.  And I agree.  Every movie that we watch, whether it’s Spielberg or Pasolini, we do so to be entertained.</p>

      The “art house” (I really hate that term) vs. entertainment dichotomy is pretty artificial. Films can be both or neither.
<p>I’d use a simpler classification:</p>
<p>1.  I wish I hadn’t wasted my time with that junk.</p>
<p>2. Yeah, that was a pleasant way to pass the time.</p>
<p>3.  That struck a chord, I’ll want to watch it again.</p>

….  and each of us is going to have some surprising entries in each category.  You never know. I had an Ayn Rand fan explain to me recently why “Seven Samurai” is an inferior film (insufficiently heroic). My restraint was admirable.
One of the interesting figures in a discussion like this, to me, would be Don Siegel. He certainly isn’t in the “art house” category but he’s a wizard with a budget and his films most always have solid craft and substance.

      <p>I dislike the term too, Doinel, because it essentially stems from an exihibition style—films that were presented as art in specialized theaters rather than the standard practice of presenting films as entertainment. If “art house” became an actual filmmaking style, it was only after it had been firmly established as an exhibition style.</p>

      <p>art is entertaining to me, but it entertains ideas mainly I guess, entertainment is……this one is harder…….like when you mention Speilberg, Jurrasic Park entertains the idea of dinosaurs being brought back, it could have been a film about meddling with nature, about what is sacred, having morals without religion, repercussions for man and stuff……but its not so I guess its entertainment rather than art? It definentily doesn’t articulate or elaborate on topics it could have, but then it would be a different film altogether……….</p>

      <p>Entertainment is certainly easier to define (or, at least, recognize) than is art, which I suspect is part of the difficulty in making the distinction. There’s also, as has already been said, a good deal of interpenetration between the two. Does Scorsese accelerating the cutting in his recent films make them less artistic because it makes them closer to the commercial-orientated Hollywood norm? I’m not sure.</p>

      <p>I like to imagine they’re both, especially since I am typically entertained by some so-called “art house” films but entertained in a different way then say, “Machine Girl”.

      <p>I really think there must be a way of getting to the heart of this question: what separates film as art from film as entertainment? Let me go back to basics a bit, and rephrase something I was dealing with on a thread I had way back when on defining a ‘canon’. One of the examples I was using on the problem of defining a canon was Gone with the Wind. Where does it fit in? Since it came out just before Citizen Kane, and was an immediate sensation, I wondered why it never gets any respect now – from ‘cinephile’ oriented critics?</p>
<p>If we really could get at the heart of what separates these two films, as we tried to do when discussing Citizen Kane on another thread, I think we might find the answer. GWTW was a landmark film of its time in every way. It had great style, great look, and a sweeping storyline. It was an immediate hit with its audiences – and still is. Yet, the critical community, including everyone on this site, would considerate it not worthy of serious discussion, whereas Citizen Kane is. I am not disagreeing with this sentiment, but it does clearly draw the distinction I want to draw of film as ‘entertainment’ vs film as ‘art’. Just saying that GWTW is too sloppily sentimental, or too this or that, doesn’t really address the question. Also, think of Casablanca – is it just entertainment or is it art? What’s the verdict?</p>

      <p>its a tough dichotomy.  that’s why its so hard to get at an answer.</p>
<p>the honest truth is “Casablanca” is entertainment AND art.  the terms aren’t mutually exclusive.  we’re acting like they are, which is why we’re having difficulties addressing the question.  thats all it comes down to.</p>

      <p>Bobby: I tend to agree, that maybe it is too hard to really separate these terms, but let’s ask ourselves the question, posed many times on this site one way or another, what IS a workable definition of <strong>film as art</strong>? If we can think of the terms of reference, it might be clearer, instead of thinking about what is ‘entertainment’ – which is a really hard one to pin down.</p>

      <p>film as art is a film not designed for the masses, or even mass consumption.  therefore, i guess, film as art is elitist.</p>

      <p>Yes, Bobby, I think there is definately a element of elitism to it. Hegel believed that the philosophy of Aesthetics is the history of Aesthetics—that, essentially, the definition of Aesthetics is just the narrative of its history . . . the history of a certain strain of elitism.</p>
<p>Walter Benjamin , on the other hand, thought that film was not so much an art form, but more of a transitional phase between art forms.</p>
<p>I’ve already brought this up in another thread (so pardon the repetition), but in his Film Comment article on “the film canon,” Paul Schrader (with an indebtedness to the literary critic Harold Bloom) proposes the following criteria:</p>
<p>-Beauty<br>
- Strangeness. Harold Bloom uses the term “strangeness” in lieu of the more common “originality.” Strangeness is the type of     originality that we can “never altogether assimilate.”<br>
-Unity of form and subject matter<br>
-Tradition.<br>
-Repeatability<br>
-Viewer engagement<br>
-Morality  . . . “Movies will always have a moral component. One can’t depict real-life situations, develop characters, and tell stories over time without moral ramifications. . . the point is that no work that fails to strike moral chords can be canonical.”</p>

      <p>OK, Matt: I am applying those criteria to GWTW. So far, it seems to have all of the above, except possibly for ‘strangeness’. I guess there isn’t too much of Last Year at Marienbad here, as most things in the film are quite clearly defined, but it does seem to meet the other terms. Does that make it an art <del>house</del> film?</p>

      <p>Bob, I think it’s perhaps a little shaky in the areas of strangeness, unity, and repeatability. Part of the reason GWtW is not necessarily considered a canonical film is because Victor Fleming isn’t considered a canonical director, and the successes of the film are often attributed to others. Andrew Sarris:</p>
<p>“That Gone With the Wind succeeded as entertainment is due largely to the inspired casting of Vivian Leigh . . . . That it failed as personal art is due to the incessant interference with a project that was always too big to be controlled by a single directorial style.”</p>
<p>(Sarris placed Fleming on the lowest tier—“miscelleny”—in The American Cinema)</p>
<p>Also, GWtW is one of those films that had so much commercial success that I think it’s popularity made it somewhat resistant to being taking seriously as art.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it’s canonical, which I guess is more or less a synonym for “art film.”</p>

      <p>Matt: I basically agree, and support your conclusion. Yet, I think Sarris is being a <em>little</em> unfair on Fleming, who, after all, also did a great job on Wizard of Oz and was called in to rescue this film – which he certainly did. That being said, I think it is hard to see GWtW as an ‘art film’, perhaps because of its very popularity. Yet, the inclusion of Vivien’s great performance, the film score, the cinematography, the vast scope and epic quality of the film, still qualify it as a ’canon’’ film – just not an ‘art’ film – like Kane.</p>

      <p>The answer lies somewhere down the middle, Bob Stutsman.</p>
<p>I believe art cinema has established the critical mind state by which greatness is measured, something that is deemed both suspicious and in need of revision.</p>
<p>The best of film, the ones that are held in high regard in america, managed to both entertain AND offer a degree of artistry in telling the story. In rubbing elbows with critics who elevate films to merit, it is imperative that critical dogma not be the defining factor by which to respond to. Films speak to everybody, you brought up a good point in stating why Godard, Bergman, and his contemporaries are highly respect as the “masters” of cinema yet a master like James Cameron and Ridley Scott is not given as much drift because they make films with commercial value. What is art and what is entertainment is mutually exclusive, but the best crosses paths.</p>
<p>Film is utterly subjective. Watching a Peter Greenaway film is akin to strangling myself slowly, yet there are people who will be entertain watching them. It’s a matter of taste.</p>
<p>Do I go back and watch a Godard movie to be entertained? absolutely not. Then again I am not easily impressed by what the conscious tells me greatness is. But I sure go and pop in a James Cameron flick and be moved to my feet by it’s technical, directorial, and thematic virtuosity and get more out of it. I am inherently suspect of what most people tend to like and refer to art, because most times their basis for liking something is because someone else told them it was great. This is true of film, this is true of everything. If someone didn’t tell me 2001: A Space Odyssey wasn’t a great movie would I still believe it? there is contradiction in all art forms, and vastness of opinion reflects what it communicates. The film speaks for itself, by the way.</p>
<p>To be defiant, I think we need to revisit critical opinion to what comprises great filmmaking by modes that are outdated. The culture has evolved, and so has people’s taste in viewing and experiencing what films can offer. Films schools across the country make people sit and watch Citizen Kane a thousand times (I’m exagerating) and tell them that’s how you make a film, but that student….the crucial link between film’s past and it’s future, could say “fuck citizen kane”, I wanna make something else. So to close it all up, film is an art form that serves both customers.</p>

      <p>Yes, Bob, Sarris’s evaluation seems to have stuck. Note the similarity in Fleming’s All-Movie Guide bio: “reliable craftsman of impersonal but handsome films.” I’m not sure how reasonable it is to expect “personal” films in the case of GWtW since it was basically a “save” for Fleming in the wake of Cukor’s departure (Fleming’s came to his other best known film, The Wizard of Oz, in more or less the same capacity).</p>
<p>Personally, of 1939 American films I prefer Hawks’ Only Angels Have Wings, McCarey’s Love Affair, and Ford’s Stagecoach to both GWtW and TWoO, but all of them more or less walk the entertainment/art line.</p>

      <p>i disagree that canonical films are synonomous with art films.  therefore, we have to be careful with utilizing schrader’s criteria as our methodology.  he was writing specifically about canonization.</p>
<p>maybe this is the more interesting question at the heart of the matter.  what is it about popular and successful films that makes us want to resist calling them “art films”, or just art.</p>

<p>it seems to me that after all this time, over a century, we still dont want to come to grips with film being art at all.  again, does it come back to popularity, or mass appeal as a debilitating factor?</p>

<p>I don’t want to get too deep into the semantics, here but, well, yes, I suppose I should have said “film art” rather than “art film”—the difference being that the concept of the “art film” is usually a presentation strategy that dates back to the importing of European films to the US post-WWII, and which basically implies that the film(s) in question has/have artistic value beyond that of the standard fare (even if this was never actually the filmmaker’s intention at all). I think this is where the “pretentious” complaint comes in—the presenters of the “art film” make claim to the status of art without the benefit of argument or historical weight.</p>
<p>On the other hand, “film art” or “film as art” implies film considered as art,usually in much broader and historical context, including canonization.</p>
<p>Film (if it is an art at all) is still a very young art in the scheme of things . . . I imagine the aesthetics will get worked out sooner or later.</p>
