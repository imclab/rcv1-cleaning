Your obsession with tacky tatts is becoming more and more ridiculous. To add to his other icky inkings, the 1D stud has only gone and had the lyrics from George Michael\u2019s\u00a0 Careless Whisper tattooed on his ankles \u2013 with \u2018Never gonna\u2019 on his right foot and \u2018dance again\u2019 on his left! <br \/><br \/><br \/>It\u2019s safe to say that Lady Gaga loves to shock. So when the sultry singer elegantly arrived as the beautiful bridesmaid at her friend\u2019s wedding in Cabo San Lucas wearing a pretty bridesmaid dress, it was actually more shocking than if she\u2019d rocked up as the Bride of Frankenstein. Big Kudos to the bride I Imagine it wasn't easy\u00a0 to persuade Gaga to dress to wear her choice of bridesmaid dress!<br \/><br \/><br \/>Good ol\u2019 LIndsay Lohan clearly isn\u2019t one to let something small like being arrested and spending months in rehab get in the way of her social schedule! It seems that LiLo doesn\u2019t plan to lie low at all when she\u2019s released in August. After a bizarre rehab centre switch this week, Linds plans to go straight to the Venice Film Festival to make an appearance at the premiere of her new film, The Canyons. Well it is her movie premier!<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>The Kardashians have added another raven-haired beauty to their brood after Kim Kardashian gave birth to a baby girl at the weekend. Clearly as fame-hungry as her mum and aunties, it seems the little mite was so keen to appear on the family\u2019s E! reality shows that she popped out a month early, weighing in at just under 5lbs. <br \/><br \/><br \/>We can never keep up with Miley Cyrus\u2019s relationship status. This week she was overheard telling a very flirty Justin Bieber that her engagement to Liam hemsworth was back on.

Your obsession with tacky tatts is becoming more and more ridiculous. To add to his other icky inkings, the 1D stud has only gone and had the lyrics from George Michael\u2019s\u00a0 Careless Whisper tattooed on his ankles \u2013 with \u2018Never gonna\u2019 on his right foot and \u2018dance again\u2019 on his left! <br \/><br \/><br \/>It\u2019s safe to say that Lady Gaga loves to shock. So when the sultry singer elegantly arrived as the beautiful bridesmaid at her friend\u2019s wedding in Cabo San Lucas wearing a pretty bridesmaid dress, it was actually more shocking than if she\u2019d rocked up as the Bride of Frankenstein. Big Kudos to the bride I Imagine it wasn't easy\u00a0 to persuade Gaga to dress to wear her choice of bridesmaid dress!<br \/><br \/><br \/>Good ol\u2019 LIndsay Lohan clearly isn\u2019t one to let something small like being arrested and spending months in rehab get in the way of her social schedule! It seems that LiLo doesn\u2019t plan to lie low at all when she\u2019s released in August. After a bizarre rehab centre switch this week, Linds plans to go straight to the Venice Film Festival to make an appearance at the premiere of her new film, The Canyons. Well it is her movie premier!<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>The Kardashians have added another raven-haired beauty to their brood after Kim Kardashian gave birth to a baby girl at the weekend.
