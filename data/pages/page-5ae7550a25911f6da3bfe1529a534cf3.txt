The film was directed by Paul Hunter. It is loosely based on the comic book by Michael Avon Oeming. The film was shot in Toronto, Ontario, and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Based on the very underground comic book, an immortal Tibetan monk finds a   mentor in a young street kid whom he can teach to protect the ancient scroll   he's been guarding for the last sixty years. With the help of a sexy and elusive   young woman named Bad Girl, they come together to do battle with the kung fu   master who'll stop at nothing to get the scroll.

Rating PG-13<br>
Director Ang Lee surprised everyone with his martial arts epic CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. Based on a novel by Wang Du Lu, CROUCHING TIGER starts with the revenge plot common in the wuxia stories that Lee loved as a child, then adds a feminist twist. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is a legendary martial artist who has decided to pass on his sword, the Green Destiny, to a friend. Soon afterward, the sword is stolen by a masked female, setting in motion events that test the bonds of family, love, duty, and sisterhood. Chow appears with three generations of female stars: Cheng Pei Pei, a 1960s action heroine; Michelle Yeoh, the beauty queen turned 1980s action goddess; and newcomer Zhang Ziyi, who smolders as the princess who wants more than domestic tranquillity. Famed action choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping (THE MATRIX) stages jaw-dropping zero-G fights across rooftops, rivers, and bamboo trees, while Yo-Yo Ma punctuates the fisticuffs with dramatic cello solos. Described by Lee as &quot;SENSE AND SENSIBILITY with martial arts,&quot; CROUCHING TIGER recalls the best wuxia films of the 1960s and pushes the genre in new directions.

                                    Starring: Chow Yun-Fat, Gong Li, Liu Ye, Chen Jin, Jay Chou   Directed by: Zhang Yimou. Zhang returns to the hallowed hallways of halberd hoopla with a tale of court   intrigue occurring near the end of China's Tang dynasty. CURSE is a curious maze   of deception, backstabbing and decay, brilliantly translated by Zhang into what   is perhaps China's last hope for keeping alive a film genre that has been   steadily falling (or failing) in the West since HERO.

Fei Hung finds that he becomes a more powerful fighter when he consumes alcohol, although after consuming too much alcohol, he becomes very sluggish, drunk, and incapable of fighting. The film ends with a fight between Fei Hung and John (Ken Lo). <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/tmm0d41-20?node=2&page=4" target="_blank"><img src="../Images/amazon/buttons/buy.gif" alt="Buy Martial Arts Movies" border="0"></a></p>

Most Americans know him as   just another action star, but Li's background is outstanding. Before he reached   puberty, he served as an international ambassador, a key figure in the parting   of the bamboo curtain that separated China and America in the 1970s. His   precocious repartee with President Nixon showed the world that this son of   Mainland China was someone to watch. Indeed, with the possible exception of   Zhang Ziyi, Jet is the only star from the most populous nation on the planet who   is recognized internationally.

                                  Starring: Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu Wai Director: Yimou Zhang Rating PG 13. At the height of China's Warring States period, the   country was divided into seven kingdoms: Qin, Zhao, Han Wei, Yan, Chu and Qi.   For years, the separate kingdoms fought ruthlessly for supremacy. As a result,   the populace endureddecades of death and suffering. The Kingdom of Qin was the   most determined of all. The Qin King was obsessedwith conquering all of China   and becoming her first Emperor. He had long been the target of assassins   throughout the other six states. Of all the would-be killers, none inspired as   much fear as the three legendary assassins, Broken Sword, Snow and Sky.To anyone   who defeated the three assassins, the King of Qin promised great power,   mountains of gold and a private audience with the King himself. But defeating   the killers is a near impossible task. For ten years no one came close   toclaiming the prize--that is until Nameless, a solitary ranger with a   mysterious past, steps out of the shadows looking for a showdown. Starring Jet Li Maggie Cheung Tony Leung Donnie Yen Chen Daoming Zhang Ziyi Directed by Zhang   Yimou Made in China,   2003.

Originally conceived as one film, it was released in two separate 'volumes' (in late 2003 and early 2004) due to its running time of approximately four hours. The movie is an epic-length revenge drama, with homages to earlier film genres, such as Hong Kong martial arts movies, Japanese Chanbara films, exploitation films and Italian spaghetti westerns; an extensive use of popular music and pop culture references; and aestheticization of violence. Filming took place in California, Texas, Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Mexico.<br>

Unexpectedly chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy, Po's dreams become reality when he joins the world of Kung Fu and studies alongside his idols, the legendary Furious Five -- Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey -- under the leadership of their guru, Master Shifu. But before they know it, the vengeful and treacherous snow leopard Tai Lung is headed their way, and it's up to Po to defend everyone from the oncoming threat. Can he turn his dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master into reality? Po puts his heart - and his girth - into the task, and the unlikely hero ultimately finds that his greatest weaknesses turn out to be his greatest strengths.

When the Japanese military police attempt to seize the training hall, the three disciples resist and soundly defeat them, though Choei receives a crippling injury. Afterwards, on his deathbed, their master bids his pupils to focus their skills inward and decide who is worthy of being his successor and inheriting his black belt. Taikan and Giryu, as the only two viable candidates, follow different paths on their journey to discovering the meaning behind their master's last words.<br>

It was theatrically released on March 14, 2008. <SPAN id="movie_synopsis_all">Never Back Down is the story of Jake   Tyler, a tough kid who leads with his fists, and, often, with his heart. Jake   Tyler, played by Sean Faris, is the new kid in town with a troubled past. He has   recently moved to Orlando, Florida with his family who has relocated to support   his younger brother&rsquo;s shot at a professional tennis career. Jake was a star   athlete on the football team at home, but in this new city he is an outsider   with a reputation for being a quick tempered brawler. Making an attempt to fit   in, at the invitation of a flirtatious classmate, Baja (Amber Heard) Jake goes   to a party where he is unwittingly pulled into a fight with a bully named Ryan   McDonald (Cam Gigandet). While he is defeated and humiliated in the fight, a   classmate introduces himself to Jake and tells him about the sport known as   Mixed Marshall Arts (MMA). He sees a star in Jake and asks that he meet with his   mentor, Jean Roqua, played by Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond, In America). It is   immediately apparent to Jake that MMA is not street fighting, but rather an art   form he wants to master. Roqua will take Jake under his wing, but it is up to   Jake to find the patience, discipline, willingness and reason within him to   succeed. For Jake, there is much more at stake than mere victory. His decision   will not just settle a score; it will define who he is. --&copy; Summit   Entertainment.

However, behind this humble facade, he is a master swordsman gifted   with a lightning-fast draw and breathtaking precision. While wandering, Zatoichi   discovers a remote mountain village at the mercy of Ginzo, a ruthless   gang-leader. Ginzo disposes of anyone who gets in his way, especially after   hiring the mighty samurai ronin, Hattori, as a bodyguard.

As the paths of these   and other colorful characters intertwine, Ginzo's henchmen are soon after   Zatoichi. With his legendary cane sword at his side, the stage is set for a   riveting showdown.

Sent to train at the illustrious Order of the Black Scorpion   academy, Mathayus spends the next seven years learning to become a fighting and   killing machine-driven by his vow to one day avenge his father. Convinced his   only hope of defeating Sargon and his growing power is by retrieving a charmed   sword from the Underworld, Mathayus embarks on a perilous supernatural   odyssey--accompanied by the tomboyish wannabe-warrior Layla, the aspiring Greek   playwright Ari, a freed Chinese captive Fong, and a few other characters he   meets and enlists along the way. At stake is not only the fate of the entire   Akkadian nation but of Mathayus's very soul as well.
