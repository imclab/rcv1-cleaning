      <h1><strong>Cheap Cars </strong></h1>
      <h2><strong>How and Where to Find the Cheapest Cars</strong>      </h2>
      <p><img src="../images/cheap-cars.jpg" alt="cheap cars" width="300" height="218" border="0" align="left" />Cheap cars can be found and purchased from a variety of sources. Generally, people who are looking for cheap cars are simply attempting to find the best car that meets their needs, at the lowest possible cost. </p>
      <p>For those who are looking for inexpensive cars, there are essentially three categories of options available to them &#8212; cheap <em>new cars</em>, cheap <em>used cars</em>, and cheap <em>leased cars</em>. Let's focus mainly on used or pre-owned cars.</p>
      <p>Used cars at low prices are available from dealers, individuals, auctions, and on the Internet. Considerable care must be taken when buying pre-owned cars because most are sold &quot;as-is&quot; and will come without a guarantee or warranty. <a href="/Articles/certifiedcar.htm">Certified Cars</a> offered by dealers are used cars with short warranties, but can be more expensive.</p>
      <p>Following are the best places to find cheap cars for sale:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Used-Cars   at New-Car Dealers</strong> - Most new-car dealers typically sell both   new cars and pre-owned cars. Although inexpensive cars can often be   found on these lots, most new-car dealers only offer  late   model used vehicles that have been taken in trade or are off-lease,   and are in good condition &#8212; and are relatively expensive. Older,   less expensive vehicles are usually sent to auction to be purchased   by independent used-car dealers (see below) and BHPH dealers (see below).   Therefore, check your local new-car dealers when looking for a cheap used car but also look at other sources listed   below. </p>

        </div>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Independent   Used-Car Dealers</strong> - Independent used-car lots (not associated with a new-car dealer) are a potential   source of affordable cheap second hand cars. Many lots have older vehicles that   can be real bargains. However, proper caution should be taken to determine   if the price is fair and that the vehicle has no hidden problems. Most   used cars are sold &quot;as-is&quot; and come without any kind of warranty   or return policy. See <a href="http://www.used-car-advisor.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buying   a Used Car </a> for more details.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Consignment Lots</strong> - Many towns and cities have used-car consignment lots which can be a good source of inexpensive vehicles. Sellers display their cars-for-sale on the consignment lot for a fee. Lot managers  are often authorized by car owners to negotiate prices with potential buyers, or buyers may be directed back to the seller to discuss prices.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Buy-Here-Pay-Here   (BHPH) Dealers</strong> - A special type of independent used-car dealer   that provides <em>in-house financing</em>, usually with no credit check. Most   BHPH dealers are local and can be recognized by their &quot;we finance   anyone&quot; or &quot;no credit check&quot; banners. Be aware that interest   rates are usually very high and payment terms are strict.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />National   Used-Car Dealers - </strong>If you live in an area that has a <em>Carmax</em> car superstore, this is one of the largest, most reputable used-car   dealers in the country, and a good source of fair no-hassle deals &#8212;   although not necessarily the cheapest deals. They inspect the cars they   sell, provide a money-back guarantee, and provide a limited warranty. Many people   consider <em>Carmax</em> cars to be a bit overpriced, but you get a little extra   peace of mind for the money.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />New-Car   Bargains</strong> - Don't overlook this year's (or last year's) brand   new cars as a potential source of good bargains. There are currently <strong>tons of heavy rebates and other incentives being offered by   car manufacturers</strong>, especially on domestic brands, and especially on last year's models, that can   often make certain new cars temporarily less expensive than used cars   of the same make and model. See <a href="/Articles/car-rebates.htm" target="_self">New Car Rebates and Incentives</a>. </p>
        <p><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" /> <a href="http://www.usedcars.com/?refid=22301&amp;detid=11111" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>UsedCars.com </strong></a> - <em>UsedCars.com</em> is the Internet's <strong>largest used car buying service</strong>,   with over a half a million used car listings. They have helped millions   of people find second hand cars at good deals all over the country. We like   the search tool that allows you to locate cars in your area in the price   range you want. If you are looking for cheap cars, they've already worked   out discounted prices with the sellers, and make the buying process   easy. We like this service and recommend <a href="http://www.usedcars.com/?refid=22301&amp;detid=11111" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>UsedCars.com</strong></a></p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Lease   a New Car</strong> - If your goal is simply to get low monthly car payments,   leasing a new car can be 30% to 60% less expensive than buying the same   car with a loan &#8211; cut your payments in half. <strong>This allows   you to drive a brand new car for the same or less money than you might   spend on a late model used car.</strong> You can look at special promotional lease deals at <a href="http://best-car-deals.buyerreports.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Car Deals</a>. The deals are genuinely good deals but you should make sure you can live with the term (usually 36 months), the annual mileage limit (usually 10K-12K miles per year), and the down payment, if any. However, be sure to read our   free <a href="/lease01.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lease Guide</a> before you make a decision   to lease. Leasing provides  low monthly payments but it is not always the right answer for everyone. </p>

        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Car Lease   Takeover</strong> - Online services such as <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-817987-5439769" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >Swapalease</a><img src="http://www.awltovhc.com/image-817987-5439769" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> offer car lease takeovers at bargain prices. These are almost-new   cars being offered by sellers who are often desperate to get out of their   leases. They need someone to take their car and their lease payments. If you can find a car you want, this can be the <strong>cheapest   way to drive a good late model car</strong>. Payments can be very low   compared to a new car loan, or even a used car loan. <strong>Credit   requirements are not as strict</strong>. There's no down payment and sellers frequently offer <strong>cash   back</strong> as an incentive for someone to take over their lease.   These can be excellent deals. <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-817987-5439769" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >Swapalease</a> is the largest and best of the lease transfer assistance services.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Free   Cars</strong> - If you live near a large city, or university campus,   you may be eligible for a <a href="/Articles/freecar.htm">Free-Car program</a>.   It's tough to qualify but the rewards are great &#8212; a free car to   drive. These programs are offered by advertising companies who use &quot;vehicle   wrap&quot; marketing techniques.<strong> Free is about as cheap as you   can get</strong>. Competition is heavy so don't expect to get accepted   right away into a free-car program.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Get   Paid to Drive</strong> - <a href="/Articles/getpaidtodrive.htm">Get-Paid-to-Drive   programs</a> are similar to the previously mentioned free-car program,   except that you <strong>get paid to drive your own car</strong> with   paint-safe vinyl ads displayed on your own car. The money can help make   your car payments and pay expenses. That amounts to cheap transportation.   Again, it's not easy to qualify for these programs.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Government   Car Auctions</strong> - This is an often overlooked source of cheap   cars and trucks. Local, state, and federal government and law enforcement   agencies frequently auction surplus and seized vehicles. Outstanding   bargains are possible. To participate, you have to know where and when   the auctions take place, and how to bid. See <a href="/Articles/carauctions.htm" target="_parent">Government   Auto Auctions</a> for more details.</p>

        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Damaged   Cars</strong> - Low cost cars can often be found at sources of <a href="/Articles/damagedcars.htm">Salvage   Cars - Damaged Cars</a>, although some repairs are often necessary. <a href="/Articles/salvage-auction.htm"> Salvage Auctions and Insurance   Auctions</a> are another possible source of cheap cars and project cars   for sale. Obviously, a lot of caution must be taken to make sure you   know exactly what you're buying but, if done correctly, some great deals   can be had this way.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Police   Auctions</strong> - Law enforcement agencies seize and impound vehicles   from law-breakers and sell them at public <a href="/Articles/policeimpound.htm">Police   Impound Auctions</a>, for bargain prices. Many are high-end late-model   luxury vehicles in perfect condition. These agencies also sell <a href="/articles/surpluscars.htm">Surplus Vehicles</a> that are being replaced with newer vehicles. These auctions are conducted regularly   and are open to the public. </p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Repossessed   Cars</strong> - <a href="/Articles/repoauctions.htm">Repo Car Sales   and Auctions</a> are a good source of cheap cars. Banks repossess cars   from customers who stop making payments and default on loans. They must   sell these repo cars to recover the remaining loan balance. Bargains   are not difficult to find if you know how and where to look.</p>

Cars   that have been declared total losses by insurance companies can often   be purchased as salvage vehicles and project cars for almost nothing.   Many of these vehicles have little damage and can be rebuilt and restored   to good running order for little money.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Unclaimed   and Abandoned Car Auctions</strong> - Cities and towing companies pick   up unclaimed abandoned vehicles every day from the sides of streets, highways, and parking lots. They try to find the owners, but if   they can't, the cars are sold at auction, often for almost nothing.   The cars can range from junkers to almost-new vehicles. See our article, <a href="/Articles/unclaimed_vehicles.htm">How to Find and Buy Unclaimed   Cars</a>.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Rental   Car Sales</strong> - Rental car agencies, such as <em>Enterprise</em> and <em>Hertz</em> , often dispose of late-model vehicles in public sales.  Many people   use this method regularly for buying their family cars. Prices are often   lower than at used-car dealers because rental companies are not trying   to make a profit. However, many of the vehicles may have high mileage and undisclosed problems.</p>

        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Purchase   from Individual</strong> - You can find cheap used cars being sold by individuals   by searching newspaper classifieds, web sites such as AutoTrader, on   supermarket bulletin boards, and at local car sales consignment lots.   Many are being sold at low prices for a good reason. In many cases,   these cars have problems that the seller is not disclosing. Or the seller   could simply be desperate and needs the money fast. Such cars are sold   &quot;as is&quot; which means you have no recourse if problems come   up. See <a href="http://www.used-car-advisor.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Used-Car-Advisor.com</a> for important advice.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="/images/checkmark.gif" width="17" height="15" hspace="5" />Get   a Used Car Dealer's License</strong> - This is not a solution for everyone,   but it can work for some. The idea is to get a used car dealer's license,   go to dealers' car auctions, and buy cars at wholesale prices &#8212;   even buy and sell for profit. Since state laws determine how to get   a dealer's license, you have to know how to do it. Here is an article   that explains how to <a href="http://leasekit.carbook.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Buy   and Sell Cars for Profit</a>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Watch out for online car buying scam</strong><br />
        Be aware of a <strong>common car selling scam</strong> in which an online seller offers a nice car for a price that seems too good to be true. This scam is very common on web sites such as <em>Craigslist</em> and <em>Autotrader</em>. It is almost impossible to spot the scam from the ads, except that the price seems to be unbelievably low. If you fall for the scam, you'll lose your money and you'll never see the car you &quot;bought.&quot; See the following article, <a href="http://www.used-car-advisor.com/car-seller-scam.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Car Seller Scam</a> for details.</p>
      <p><strong>Get your car inspected</strong><br />
        Regardless of where you decide to buy your cheap car, you should have the vehicle thoroughly inspected, whether you do it yourself or hire someone to do it. By doing so, you'll protect yourself from making serious mistakes that can't be corrected later. Look in your telephone yellow pages for &quot;vehicle inspection service&quot; or go to a local car service shop. Although there will be a small cost, it's a good investment. Also get a <a href="http://www.carfax.com/cfm/purchase_options.cfm?BannerName=5&amp;AffiliateID=1339&amp;partner=KOW_B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> CARFAX Vehicle History Report</a><img src="https://affiliate.carfax.com/se.asp?e=5&amp;id=1339" /> to make sure your car doesn't have a hidden salvage title and has never been wrecked.</p>
      <p><strong>If you need a loan</strong><br />
        Used car loans are available from banks, credit unions, and online loan companies such as <a href="https://www.fundingway.com/ace/app_form_plane.php?app_aff_id=ap001172&aff_sub_id=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Auto Credit Express</strong></a> and <a target='new' href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=GF7t33bEmzs&offerid=229209.10000862&type=3&subid=0" ><strong>CarsDirect</strong></a><IMG border=0 width=1 height=1 src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=GF7t33bEmzs&bids=229209.10000862&type=3&subid=0" />, that specialize in getting auto loans for people with poor credit. If you have bad credit, getting approved might be difficult, though not impossible. It's best to get preapproved so that you'll know exactly how much you are allowed to borrow. Read our article, <a href="/Articles/bad-credit.htm"><strong>Bad Credit Car Loans</strong></a>, for more information.</p>
      <p><strong>Other resources for cheap cars</strong><br />
        We can recommend another web site (actually one of our own sister web sites), <a href="http://cheap-cars.stackpoint.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Cheap Cars</strong></a>, as an additional resource for anyone looking for a car for cheap. Here you'll find up-to-date information and advice that is updated frequently. Give it a look.</p>
      <p><strong>Best prices on brand new cars</strong><br />
        Car manufacturers are constantly offering rebates and other incentives that make some brand new cars cheaper than late model used cars. It's easy enough to ask for free no-obligation price quotes from local dealers to find out. Try <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-817987-11253991?sid=cheapcars" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>TrueCar</strong></a><img src="http://www.lduhtrp.net/image-817987-11253991" width="1" height="1" border="0"/> for some of the best prices from dealers in your area.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
        Cheap cars are available from many different places including consignment lots, police impound auctions, government seized and surplus auctions, repossessed vehicle sales, online used car web sites, and rental car sales. You may have to invest a little time and effort to find them but the results can be rewarding.</p>
